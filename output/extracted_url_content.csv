Rescue workers were still searching for nearly 100 missing people, including 22 soldiers, on Thursday, according to the Sikkim state government. Vinay Bhushan Pathak, the states top bureaucrat, said that 26 people had been taken to hospitals with injuries, while nearly 3,000 tourists were stranded in the floodhit areas along with 700 taxi drivers. We are evacuating them through helicopters provided by the army and the air force, he said. The South Llonak Lake has been rising in recent years as a warming climate melts the glaciers that feed it, putting pressure on the dam that contains it, but it wasnt clear what triggered the breach Wednesday. Experts and varying government reports have pointed to sudden, intense rains in the area, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon. Eleven bridges in the Lachan Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said.

Article content Several towns, including Dikchu and Rangpo in the Teesta basin, were flooded, and schools in four districts were ordered shut until Sunday, the states education department said. Parts of a highway that links Sikkim, the state capital, with the rest of the country were also washed away. The floods also hit several army camps, burying vehicles in feet of mud, according to images released by the Indian military. The Press Trust of India news agency cited a statement by neighboring West Bengal state as saying that the bodies of four soldiers were found. However, it wasnt immediately clear whether they were among the 22 missing soldiers, or had died separately. One soldier who had been reported missing on Wednesday was later rescued by authorities, the army said in a statement. The army is providing medical aid and phone connectivity to civilians in the areas of Chungthang, Lachung and Lachen in north Sikkim, the army statement said. Prime Minister Narendra Modis office said in a statement that the government would support state authorities in the aftermath of the flooding.

Article content The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost 1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operations in 2017. Despite risks to dams due to increasing frequency of extreme weather, the Indian federal government aims to increase Indias hydroelectric dam output by half, to 70,000 megawatts, by 2030. Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in Indias Himalayan region during the JuneSeptember monsoon season. Scientists say they are becoming more frequent as global warming contributes to the melting of glaciers there. This is, incredibly sadly, another classic case of a cascading hazard chain that amplifies as you go downstream, said Jakob Steiner, a climate scientist with the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development, commenting on Wednesdays flash flooding. Earlier this year, Steiners organization published a report saying that Himalayan glaciers could lose 80 of their volume if global warming isnt controlled. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. In February 2021, flash floods killed nearly 200 people and washed away houses in Uttarakhand state in northern India. Arasu reported from Bengaluru, India.

Immersive Fort Tokyo will offer 12 attractions spread across 6 shops and restaurants, putting visitors in the middle of fictional situations such as a murder mystery, or a treasure hunt. The venue will be entirely indoors, making use of a shopping mall in the middle of Tokyo Bay that closed its doors last year. The new destination is the brainchild of Tsuyoshi Morioka, a former Procter Gamble Co. executive who made his name by turning around Universal Studios Japan by introducing new attractions, including the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

Fatih Aktas Anadolu Agency Getty Images As New York residents and business owners recover their drenched and damaged properties from Fridays flash floods, city and state officials are confronting the reality that extreme weather is no longer just a passing phenomenon. Theres no question that the rain on Friday is part of a pattern that is directly linked to climate change, New York City Chief Climate Officer Rohit Aggarwala told CNBC in an interview. He grew up in New York when winters were snowy and summers were hot but bearable. He said todays New York reminds him more of Miami than the place he remembers from childhood. In 2020, the National Climate Assessment changed New York Citys climate classification from continental to humid subtropical characterized by mild winters, humid summers and intense rainfall. The city has so far lived up to the new label. Winters have become noticeably warmer. And last weeks storm added to the list of recent record rainfall, bringing back memories of Hurricane Henri in August 2021 and Hurricane Ida in September 2021. What we once thought of as a rare event, a low probability of occurrence maybe these events are increasing in frequency, said Nelson Vaz, a meteorologist at the New York office of the National Weather Service. Aggarwala is leading the charge on the citys climate adaptation strategy. When it comes to rain, Aggarwala is concerned about the lack of permeable surfaces in the city due to people paving over lawns and grass in favor of, for example, new parking spots. What that means is that theres nowhere for the rainwater falling on that property to go, he said. Some ways hes looking to address it Turning basketball court enclosures into giant rain buckets, developing pockets of wetlands, installing socalled rain gardens on sidewalks, and building walls along the shorelines to keep out coastal storms. A 2018 rendering of a cloudburst design basketball court in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, NY. The court is sunken to capture excessive rainfall. Source Marc Wouters Studios The basketball court strategy is an example of cloudburst design, or infrastructure developed specifically for sudden, heavy rainfall like that of last week. Cloudburst basketball courts are depressed into the ground with crowd seating surrounding it, creating an enclosure that could hold excessive storm water. The same idea could be applied to create cloudburst gardens. New Yorks cloudburst infrastructure was piloted in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens. In January, Mayor Eric Adams announced funding for more cloudburst projects in Queens, as well as the Bronx and Brooklyn. Another floodproofing venture is The Bluebelt Program, an initiative that connects storm sewers to ponds, rivers and other wetlands in New York City to create natural detours for excess rain. Its mostly been developed in Staten Island, which Aggarwala says is part of the reason the borough experienced minimal flooding on Friday. A map of a bluebelt in Staten Islands Mill Pond. Bluebelts are connected to storm sewers to collect excess runoff. Source New York City Department of Environmental Protection New York City environmental agencies are also working on installing rain gardens. To the average New Yorker, Aggarwala said, a rain garden might just look like a tree pit with no tree. The gardens receive rain water via a downward slope on the curb of the road, which diverts runoff from overtaxed sewers and puts it to gardening use. Roughly 12,000 rain gardens have already been installed in New York City sidewalks, according to Aggarwala. Rain gardens line a sidewalk in Queens, NY. A downward slope allows rainwater from the road to filter into the gardens. Source NYC Water Along with extreme rainstorms, the climate chief is equally or more concerned about the threat of extreme heat, which causes more fatalities in the city rainfall. His office is working with the city to develop a mandate for air conditioning in residential buildings. In September, New York Governor Kathy Hochul approved the installation of 30,000 window heat pump units, which can be used to heat as well as cool the air in buildings.

The brief ruckus was a test of the Wireless Emergency Alerts system, launched by the Federal Emergency Management Agency more than a decade ago to deliver alerts for extreme weather, missing children and other imminent threats. The National Weather Service and emergency management agencies have used the system effectively since its inception, but with some recent notable failures. The Wireless Emergency Alerts WEA system not only enables the U.S. government to instantly reach hundreds of millions of people nationwide in the case of a widespread emergency such as a terrorist attack, but it also allows local authorities to contact people in a certain area experiencing a more localized threat. The alerts look like text messages and are accompanied by a special tone and vibration. The National Weather Service issues WEAs in dangerous weather situations to get the attention of people who may not be tuned in to local media or subscribed to weather alerting services. Advertisement The alerts have been a game changer in helping to get warnings to people quickly, according to Michael Gerber, a Weather Service meteorologist and emergency alerts expert. Ive heard dozens of stories of lives saved and tragedies avoided as a result of WEAs. The system has experienced its share of successes and failures. More than 70,000 alerts had been sent by emergency managers to warn of severe weather, the Federal Communications Commission said last year, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reports that 136 children have been recovered because of AMBER alerts sent as WEAs. In early August, however, many people did not receive an evacuation alert issued by Maui County in Hawaii during the devastating fires that killed nearly 100 people. Glitches also occurred in the system later in the month, preventing officials in San Bernardino County from sending an evacuation alert as Hurricane Hilary approached California. Advertisement Several tests of the system have gone awry as well. In 2018, also in Hawaii, what was supposed to be an internal test of the system triggered a false warning of a missile threat that caused a wave of panic. In April, many Florida residents were awakened at 445 a.m. by a test alert that was supposed to be on TV but instead sounded alarms on cellphones. The Florida Division of Emergency Management apologized a few hours later. And just last month, the U.S. Tsunami Warning Center mistakenly sent a test tsunami alert to phones in the eastern United States. In recognizing the 10th anniversary of the alerts, the Weather Service highlighted several improvements since their debut. For example, alerts now can be targeted at cellphones within onetenth mile of a warned area, whereas, previously, an entire county was alerted. And the character limit was increased from 90 to 360, allowing the messages to include more information and calls to action. Weather Service works to refine alerting The Weather Service has made occasional changes in its weather alert thresholds with a focus on notifying the public about the most dangerous, lifethreatening hazards. Advertisement In 2020, the agency switched to sending flash flood alerts only where the flooding was tagged as considerable or catastrophic, the two most severe of three categories, thus reducing the number of wireless flash flood alerts by about 85 percent. Previously, it would issue a wireless alert for every flash flood warning, typically totaling about 4,000 per year, a volume that it worried would desensitize people to the hazard. Share this article Share But the agency also has expanded the types of hazards that trigger its alerts. In 2021, the Weather Service began issuing wireless alerts for severe thunderstorm warnings that included the term destructive, a label given to storms expected to produce lifethreatening winds of at least 80 mph or hail at least 2.75 inches in diameter. Previously, wireless alerts were not issued for these warnings, which the Weather Service issues for any thunderstorm that it expects to produce damaging winds of at least 58 mph, hail at least 1 inch in diameter or a tornado. Advertisement In February, the Weather Service completed implementation of emergency alerts for highimpact snow squalls that lead to a sudden onset of whiteout conditions and icy roads. Seeking alerts for severe winter storms Last month, New York Attorney General Letitia James D called for one more change. She wrote a letter to the director of the Weather Service and the administrator of its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, asking for the reinstatement of wireless alerts for severe winter storms. The request came after 47 people died many outdoors or in their vehicles in a historic blizzard in December that buried Buffalo in nearly 50 inches of snow in three days. In the letter, James noted that alerts were sent for major blizzards when the system was deployed in 2012 but that such alerts were discontinued the next year. Such alerts likely would have prompted more people to safely take preparatory measures in the days ahead of the storm, such as stocking up on groceries, medications, and other essential items, or transporting elderlyailing family members or friends to safer spaces, James wrote. And once the Service confirmed the severity of the blizzard and local authorities had announced driving bans, additional WEA alerts could have provided calltoaction messages urging all to remain indoors and stay off the roads to avoid blocking emergency crews and ambulances. James also called for alerts to be issued in more languages than just English and Spanish after 18 people in New York, many of Asian descent, died in flooding caused by Hurricane Ida in 2021. The Weather Service sent a letter of response to James on Tuesday, Weather Service spokeswoman Susan Buchanan said in an email. The letter states that wireless alerts for blizzard and ice storm warnings were terminated on the basis of public feedback, which strongly indicated that too many WEAs were burdensome, overwhelming, and not useful for impending weather events expected in more than 12 hours in the future, according to an excerpt shared with The Washington Post. The letter said the agency is reviewing the ability to issue a special type of warning for particularly dangerous blizzards and ice storms that may enable activation of wireless alerts. Advertisement In considering whether to expand its alerts, the Weather Service will need to grapple with concerns about overwarning the public. Overalerting is a common fear in emergency management circles because it can lead people to ignore alerts and not take needed action. The sheer volume of different updates can be similarly overwhelming, burying emergency alerts in countless other messages, media and communication professors Elizabeth Ellcessor and Hamilton Bean wrote in a commentary about Wednesdays test. Many people have even opted out of alerts when possible, rummaging through settings and toggling off every alert they can find.|1

A concerned parent and activist sent the passage to KHOU 11 News and we went to HISD for answers. Excerpting a passage from a Maya Angelou book, and listen, Im all for kids reading great literature, but the content from this scene doesnt seem appropriate for an 8thgrade ELA English Language Arts class. Thats actually a subject I used to teach. Its a passage that describes pretty graphically an older man coercing a young girl into having sex with him, activist Sim Kern said. It seems to be pretty clear why teachers sounded the alarm over the lesson. Kern has two children who go to HISD schools, but thats not how they found out about it. It was sent to me because I have been talking a lot about the HISD takeover on my TikTok channel. Actually, a lot of teachers have been reaching out to me concerning lesson plans, Kern said. Superintendent Mike Miles acknowledged that the lesson didnt meet HISD standards. He issued this statement Let me begin by assuring parents and families that the curriculum and lessons given to our students will be ageappropriate and meet the high standards that I set when I was appointed in June. The issue with the 8th grade curriculum was discovered, corrected, and all campuses have been directed to ensure the right lessons are shared with children tomorrow. While this issue was identified and corrected before it impacted students or instruction, this does not meet the standards I set for the HISD team, and it does not meet the commitment we made to our educators and students. I have directed the Chief Academic Officer to review all the systems and processes related to curriculum creation to ensure that inappropriate content never gets to classrooms. In addition, I have already begun taking steps to strengthen our curriculum development and review processes. We are paying a team of HISD teacherexperts from each grade level and content area to review curriculum halftime. They will make our lessons better and Im grateful they will be joining the team. Next, we will be reaching out to engage our teachers districtwide and in our divisions to get feedback on the curricular resources we provide. This will help us strengthen lessons, catch errors more quickly so teachers dont have to, and give teachers the support we promised them. The statement didnt ease Kerns concerns. This is not the first passage 8thgrade English Language Arts teachers have seen that theyve had concerns about, Kern said. Kern is not hiding opposition to the Texas Education Agencys takeover of the district but said the teachersexperts are that are reviewing the curriculum should be identified. HISD issued this additional statement As the Superintendent indicated yesterday, no students received the reading passages that were inappropriately included in one of the 8th grade English Language Arts lesson plans for the week. Those lesson plans were replaced with rigorous, ageappropriate content. The Academics team continues to review the development of these lesson plans but at this time we believe the inappropriate passages were due to isolated human error. The curriculum team will continue to meet throughout the week to align on expectations and quality control for lesson plans moving forward. Additionally, the Superintendent continues to engage more teachers as curriculum reviewers We have already hired 25 of the 32 teachers these are HISD teachers who teach halftime and work on curriculum halftime needed to review each grade level and subject area. In October, we are launching opportunities for teachers in each division to partner with district leaders and provide feedback to make our curriculum stronger.|1

Example video title will go here for this video COLUMBIA, S.C. Wednesday, October 4, 2023, marked the 8year anniversary of the historic 2015 flood, when more than 20 inches of rain inundated parts of the Midlands. The flood destroyed many homes and businesses and caused the Columbia Canal to breach. Now, businesses and the City of Columbia are looking back on what happened and whats ahead. We were flabbergasted, President of Forest Lake Fabrics Michael Marsha said. The force of water is remarkable. Marsha remembers the 2015 flood like it was yesterday, as water washed out his business. There was fabric all out in the woods, across the street. It was a wicked scene, Marsha said. Forest Lake Fabrics says they lost 1 million in inventory. When it comes to the larger community, the flooding caused an embankment breach at the Columbia Canal, which threatened the drinking supply for thousands of Columbia residents. In 2015, people lined up for bottles of drinking water offered to those impacted. Eight years later, Assistant City Manager Clint Shealy says the City of Columbia is continuing work on the Columbia Canal through three projects. So, the first project is replacing the head gates. So, up at the entrance of the canal, the head gates during the flood became lodged with debris, so we were unable to close those gates to limit flow coming into the canal. We were unable to do that with the technology we had at that time, Shealy said. That design is complete and, in a few months will be out for bid. Then comes project two embankment recovery project. This project is scoped to repair that breach and also repair any damage along the tow of our embankment upstream, Shealy said. Last will be to have an alternative water supply. Now, the City of Columbia, residents in the surrounding communities, and businesses like Forest Lake Fabrics are moving forward and hoping nothing like the 2015 flood ever happens again. To not only restore our water supply to as good were in October 2015 but to make it better and more resilient than 2015, Shealy said.|1

Two houses bought with FEMA grants were torn down and must remain green spaces per grant guidelines. Any new development also can not cause any increase in flooding to existing homes in the neighborhood. I dont think its going to happen, longtime resident Madelyn Hughes said. Not in my lifetime. Hughes has lived on Western Avenue for 50 years. Shes concerned any new houses wont fit their historic community. Who is going to pay that much money, and its going to be crappylooking houses, Hughes said. Dyke said there are design stipulations. In addition to the elevation requirements, we also have requirements to make sure the homes that go in, whether they are elevating the existing or new homes, that they fit the current character of the neighborhood, Dyke said. But Hughes isnt sure things will stay the same. Who wants to pay that much and everybody tell them what they can and what they cant do with their million or two spent, Hughes said. Bidders must bid on all nine lots. They will not be sold individually. The city is accepting sealed bids until November 30. It will likely be January before any accepted bids are announced. If the notice of sale should fail, the city would plan to go back and do stormwater detention in the area.|1

The Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Endangered Species Act were some of the federal laws waived by DHS to make way for construction that will use funds from a congressional appropriation in 2019 for border wall construction.

The Department of Homeland Security posted the announcement on the U.S. Federal Registry with few details outlining the construction in Starr County, Texas, which is part of a busy Border Patrol sector seeing high illegal entry. According to government data, about 245,000 illegal entries have been recorded in this region during the current fiscal year. There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United States in the project areas, Alejandro Mayorkas, the DHS secretary, stated in the notice. The Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Endangered Species Act were some of the federal laws waived by DHS to make way for construction that will use funds from a congressional appropriation in 2019 for border wall construction. The waivers avoid timeconsuming reviews and lawsuits challenging violation of environmental laws. Story continues below advertisement 152 Tough new U.S. border policies deter migrant crossings Starr Countys hilly ranchlands, sitting between Zapata and McAllen, Texas, is home to about 65,000 residents sparsely populating about 1,200 square miles 3,108 square kilometers that form part of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Although no maps were provided in the announcement, a previous map shared during the gathering of public comments shows the piecemeal construction will add up to an additional 20 miles to the existing border barrier system in the area. Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said it will start south of the Falcon Dam and go past Salineno, Texas. The other concern that we have is that area is highly erosive. Theres a lot of arroyos, Eloy Vera, the county judge said, pointing out the creeks cutting through the ranchland and leading into the river. Concern is shared with environmental advocates who say structures will run through public lands, habitats of endangered plants and species like the Ocelot, a spotted wild cat. Story continues below advertisement A plan to build a wall through will bulldoze an impermeable barrier straight through the heart of that habitat. It will stop wildlife migrations dead in their tracks. It will destroy a huge amount of wildlife refuge land. And its a horrific step backwards for the borderlands, Laiken Jordahl, a southwest conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Wednesday afternoon. 204 Our borders are not open U.S. prepares for migrant surge as Title 42 ends During the Trump administration, about 450 miles of barriers were built along the southwest border between 2017 and January 2021. Texas Governor Greg Abbott renewed those efforts after the Biden administration halted them at the start of his presidency. The DHS decision on Wednesday contrasts the Biden administrations posturing when a proclamation to end the construction on Jan. 20, 2021 stated, building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution. U.S. Customs and Border Protection had no immediate comment. Story continues below advertisement The announcement prompted political debate by the Democratic administration facing an increase of migrants entering through the southern border in recent months, including thousands who entered the U.S. through Eagle Pass at the end of September. 028 Trump visits southern border wall construction in Arizona A border wall is a 14th century solution to a 21st century problem. It will not bolster border security in Starr County, U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar said in a statement. I continue to stand against the wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective border wall. Political proponents of the border wall said the waivers should be used as a launching pad for a shift in policy. After years of denying that a border wall and other physical barriers are effective, the DHS announcement represents a sea change in the administrations thinking A secure wall is an effective tool for maintaining control of our borders, Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said in a statement. Story continues below advertisement Having made that concession, the administration needs to immediately begin construction of wall across the border to prevent the illegal traffic from simply moving to other areas of the border. In August, the U.S. Border Patrol made 181,509 arrests at the Mexican border, up 37 from July but little changed from August 2022 and well below the more than 220,000 in December, according to figures released in September.|1

We owe it to our community to respond and respond quickly, Trantalis said. Watch sidebyside drone footage showing a onceflooded street in Fort Lauderdale exactly one week after the recordsetting rainfall that overwhelmed Broward County. The city created a plan called Fortify Fort Lauderdale. Its described by the mayor as an aggressive attempt to improve the infrastructure in the city, prevent backflow from canals, use pumps to push out water and replace or reline old pipes that currently leak. In addition to those plans, a new water treatment plant is in the works. Everything is expected to be completed in the next ten years. The money is going to come from different funds from state and federal grants along with taxpayer dollars, Trantalis said. The city is also focusing on the homeless problem downtown. We cant criminalize homelessness, we cant put someone in jail just because they are homeless, Trantalis said. Number one, it doesnt work, and its not helping the problem. City leaders are now working to identify their needs and connect them to services. A lot of young people are moving to our city now. A lot of retirees continue to move into our city. We have to be there, ready for them, the mayor said. That full state of the city will take place at The Parker Theater at 7 p.m. Part of the speech will honor people who stepped up during the historic floods.|1

Cornwall Gravel Construction a t contact et a fourni une estimation de 10 000 pour effectuer la modification, mais le dpartement des travaux publics pourrait utiliser lquipement du canton pour effectuer le travail luimme un cot estim 2 000 maximum. La limite de dbordement de la station de pompage est actuellement fixe 46,5 mtres, une limite qui a permis dviter cinq inondations. Lanalyse dEVB Engineering a montr quune limite de 44,65 mtres aurait permis dviter 13 inondations, ce qui signifie que labaissement de la limite de dbordement aurait un effet positif immdiat. En ce qui concerne linfiltration deau extrieure dans le systme sanitaire, la station de pompage de King Street reoit en moyenne trois litres par seconde les jours normaux. Lors de gros orages, ce dbit passe 23 litres par seconde, une augmentation spectaculaire qui prend quatre jours pour revenir la normale, selon le rapport. Sur la base de ce taux de rcupration et du fait que les proprits de River Lane ont continu tre inondes pendant trois jours, le rapport indique que LOrignal ne pourra plus stendre sans rsoudre le problme ou ajouter des stations de pompage supplmentaires. Les grosses temptes et la fonte des neiges sont de plus en plus frquentes en raison du rchauffement climatique, et le problme ne devrait donc pas disparatre. Le rapport a t reu et sera discut lors des prochaines runions.|1

Des recherches sont en cours . Les services durgence sefforcent de venir en aide aux sinistrs, a dit le chef du gouvernement du Sikkim, Prem Singh Tamang, exhortant la population rester vigilante . Le premier ministre indien Narendra Modi a pour sa part affirm quil assurait tout le soutien possible aux personnes affectes. La zone touche, une rgion montagneuse et isole de lHimalaya, se trouve prs de la frontire avec le Npal et la Chine. Le lac Lhonak est situ au pied dun glacier proche du Kangchenjunga, le troisime plus haut sommet du monde. En raison dun barrage en amont qui avait rcemment libr de leau, le niveau de la Tista tait de 4,5 mtres plus lev que la normale, a soulign larme indienne. Ponts dtruits Six ponts ont t dtruits et la route nationale qui relie le Sikkim au reste de lInde a t srieusement endommage, a racont le responsable de la gestion des catastrophes de cet tat, Prabhakar Rai. Une vido diffuse par un porteparole de larme montre un torrent de couleur brune se dverser dans une valle plante de forts, passant sur des routes et emportant des lignes lectriques sur son passage. Sur dautres images partages par les militaires, on voit des immeubles submergs jusquau premier tage dans une ville avec la pointe dune petite grue de chantier qui merge de leau. Des prcipitations intenses ont conduit cette situation catastrophique au Sikkim, o la pluie a dclench une inondation par dbordement dun lac glaciaire, endommag un barrage et caus des pertes en vies humaines , a expliqu Miriam Jackson, une scientifique spcialise dans la surveillance des glaces dans les rgions de lHimalaya. Nous observons que la frquence de ces vnements extrmes augmente mesure que le climat continue de se rchauffer et nous entrane en territoire inconnu , a ajout Mme Jackson, dans un communiqu du Centre international pour le dveloppement intgr des montagnes ICIMOD. Une partie du territoire du Sikkim est revendique par Pkin. Une confrontation mineure , selon New Delhi, avait eu lieu en janvier 2021 entre soldats indiens et chinois sur le col de Naku La qui relie le Sikkim la rgion du Tibet. Des dizaines de milliers de soldats indiens et chinois sont positionns de part et dautre de la longue frontire litigieuse entre lInde et la Chine. Le dernier conflit ouvert dampleur entre les deux pays les plus peupls du monde remonte la guerreclair de 1962, qui avait vu les troupes indiennes tre rapidement battues par larme chinoise. Rester vigilants Dans ltat voisin du Bengale occidental, des personnes ont t vacues des districts de Kalimpong, Darjeeling et Jalpaiguri vers des endroits plus srs. Les inondations et les glissements de terrain sont relativement frquents en Inde et y causent de nombreux dgts, notamment pendant la mousson, de juin septembre. Mais, en octobre, la mousson est dhabitude quasiment termine. Selon les experts, le changement climatique a augment lintensit des temptes tropicales, avec notamment des pluies plus abondantes, provoquant de soudaines inondations. La fonte des glaciers himalayens accrot galement le volume des cours deau tandis que les constructions non rglementes dans les zones sujettes aux inondations peuvent exposer les populations locales des catastrophes. Entre 2011 et 2020, les glaciers de lHimalaya ont fondu 65 plus vite que dans la dcennie prcdente, selon un rapport publi en juin par lICIMOD. Si lon se fonde sur les trajectoires dmissions actuelles, les glaciers pourraient perdre jusqu 80 de leur volume actuel dici la fin du sicle, a estim cette organisation intergouvernementale dont le sige est au Npal.|1

The flood began in the early hours of Wednesday, when water overflowed a mountain lake. It smashed through a major hydroelectric dam downstream and then poured into the valley below, where it killed at least 41 people, carrying bodies kilometres miles away, and forced thousands to flee their homes. It wasnt clear what triggered the deadly flood, the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Experts pointed to intense rain, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon, as possible contributors. But the disaster also underscores a climate dilemma that pits local environmental activists who say dams in the Himalayas are too dangerous against authorities pursuing a national green energy agenda. The design and placement of the 6yearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built. A report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority in 2019 had identified Lhonak Lake as highly vulnerable to flooding that could breach dams and cause extensive damage to life and property. The dams operator, and local agencies responsible for dam safety, did not respond to requests for comment Friday. India is counting on hydroelectric dams to meet ambitious clean energy goals that are part of a global effort to slow climate change. The government aims to increase Indias hydro power by half by 2030, to 70,000 megawatts, and has approved hundreds of new dams across the countrys mountainous north. But the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather, driven in part by climate change, puts many dams and the people living downstream from them at risk. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. Rising temperatures also cause glaciers to melt faster, putting more pressure on dams. A 2016 study found that over a fifth of the 177 dams built close to Himalayan glaciers in five countries were at risk from glacial lakes, including the Teesta 3 dam. We knew that this was coming, said Gyatso Lepcha, general secretary of Affected Citizens of Teesta, an environmental organization based in Sikkim, wrote in a statement that called for a safety review of all dams in the state. The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost 1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operation in 2017. But local activists argued that the dam didnt have enough safety features. Despite being the biggest project in the state, there were no early warning systems installed even though the glacier overflowing was a known risk, said Himanshu Thakkar of the nongovernmental organization South Asian Network for Rivers, Dams and People. Thakkar said authorities failed to apply the lessons from a 2021 dam breach in Himalayan state of Uttarakhand that killed 81 people, allowing an eerily similar disaster to occur. India passed a dam safety law in 2021, but Teesta 3 is not on a list of dams whose safety is monitored by Indias top dam regulator. Indias National Disaster Management Agency said Friday that it plans to set up early warning systems at most of Indias 56 known atrisk glacial lakes. Parts of northern Bangladesh along the Teesta River also flooded Friday as water travelled from Sikkim, local media reported. The waters are expected to rise more, as the countrys weather office forecast possible heavy rains in coming days. In Sikkim, more than 2,000 people were rescued after Wednesdays floods, the state Dsaster Management Authority said, adding that authorities set up 26 relief camps for more than 22,000 people. One soldier was previously reported missing was rescued, and the bodies of seven have been found, state police said. Eleven bridges in the Lachan Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said. The army said it was providing medical aid and phone connectivity to civilians in the areas of Chungthang, Lachung and Lachen, and local media reported that said the army was erecting temporary bridges to bring food to affected areas. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state, and record rains in northern India killed more than 100 people over two weeks in July.

Here are the improvements already completed or in progress at Rosedale Park paved parking area paved path network play infrastructure for youth accessible play amenities and soft surfacing zip line pending installation redeveloped berm area for improved sledding experience planting of trees and landscaping benches To complete the park revitalization, all that is remaining from the initial plan is the construction of a basketball court, says Brent Lamming, the citys director of community services. Kiwanis has once again utilized their strength in fundraising leveraging community support and has recently advised city staff that they have raised an additional 18,500 to allow this to happen. This is a great opportunity to complete the initial plan. Other contributions to Rosedale Park improvements have come from Child Care Algoma and Kiwanis Club of Sault Ste. Marie. As SooToday has previously reported, the neighbourhood around Rosedale Park has been identified as a highneed part of our community. Next weeks city council meeting will be on Tuesday because of the long weekend. SooToday will livestream the event starting at 5 p.m. Tuesday.|0

Windows steamed up as dinners warmed on stovetops. Children curled up with their parents and watched cartoons long past their bedtimes. A 30yearold store owner, Mohamed BinKhayal, texted his brother from a few blocks away to see whether he needed help. He said he didnt. He had obeyed government orders to shelter in place, like thousands of other families in the heart of the city. They thought they would be safe at home, away from the waters edge. Its just rain, Mustafa, a father of five, texted back. But it wasnt. Authorities in both of Libyas rival governments had known for days that Storm Daniel was coming, and for years that the dams above the city were damaged and at risk of collapse. Yet officials loyal to military commander Khalifa Hifter, head of the eastern government based in Benghazi, appeared never to consider the threat, believing instead the worst of the flooding would come from the sea. Advertisement Video evidence shows several evacuations being carried out among coastal communities in Derna, which prompted many people to move inland and into the path of the coming flood. A strict curfew, enforced by armed security personnel, required people to shelter in place. Multiple generations of families gathered together and were washed away. Warnings that the dams were filling up circulated among officials in the Ministry of Water Resources, which is responsible for water infrastructure and is part of the western government in Tripoli. They were not shared publicly until water had engulfed the city too late for Mustafa BinKhayal and so many others.

People felt that the dam would protect them from flooding, so there was no urgency for them to flee. More than 12,500 people from the area are dead or missing, according to the World Health Organization. Residents and local activists believe the true number is far higher. Government restrictions have made it difficult for reporters to access the city in recent weeks. Protests calling for accountability ended in arrests. This account of the final days and hours leading up to the disaster is based on more than two dozen interviews with residents, officials and experts, as well as videos, social media posts and documents reviewed by The Washington Post. The former mayor of Derna, since relieved of his duties, as well as water management and other government officials in Tripoli did not respond to phone calls or text messages seeking comment. Efforts to reach Hifter through senior military officials were unsuccessful. Advertisement A dangerous situation Derna is built on the ruins of an ancient Greek colony and its oldest families trace their lineage back to Andalusian times, when Muslims ruled modernday Spain. It was home to Libyas first theater troupe and has a rich intellectual history. More recently, it has been caught up in the countrys brutal civil conflict, occupied by Islamist groups and pummeled by government forces. After a monthslong siege, Hifter took control of the city in 2018. In the years that followed, both the air force that Hifter commands and the militia led by his son Saddam have been accused by Amnesty International of routinely targeting, harassing and torturing their critics in Derna. Neither Hifter nor senior officials in Tripoli have responded to the allegations. In the mountains above the city, the Derna and Bou Mansour dams, built in the 1970s, had been damaged for decades. It was a dangerous situation, according to an unpublished 2006 study from the Ministry of Water Resources, later cited by Libyan academics who reviewed it. A report from the Tripolibased Audit Bureau, submitted as part of an ongoing government investigation into the dam collapses, concluded that authorities in Tripoli failed to carry out even basic repairs. Instead, the report says, they overpaid a Turkish company by 4 million Libyan dinars for dam maintenance between 2007 and 2010 without encouraging them to finish the job or attempting to recover the funds when the project was left incomplete. The report was obtained, verified and shared with The Post by the Sentry, a Washingtonbased investigative group. While Libyan authorities have blamed the stalled maintenance on a popular uprising in 2011, the documents say that, after months of unexplained delays, work stopped completely at the end of December 2010. The Ministry of Water Resources had ample money to fix the dams in the years that followed, the report concludes, including 459 million dinars in development funds in 2021 alone. Last year, a study by hydrologist Abdelwanees Ashoor concluded that the situation in the Wadi Derna basin required immediate action. In the event of a huge flood, the result will be disastrous, he wrote. Advertisement The dams were a preoccupation for Ashoor, who had warned of their fragility as early as 2008 in his masters thesis. When he returned to Derna last year, he told The Post, he found the amount of surface runoff had increased and the probable maximum flood had increased because of conditions and soil runoff and the lack of vegetative cover. Trying to deliver those warnings to Libyan authorities felt like whistling in the ears of the dead, he said. Officials told The Post they did not consider that heavy rains could overwhelm the dams, or take steps to prepare for such a scenario. The situation in Derna looked very normal, there were no indicators that it would be a crisis, said Mohamed Douma, the water minister of the Benghazibased government in eastern Libya. But he conceded This is not an excuse for the amount of neglect that happened with the maintenance of the dams. All citizens must remain in their houses As Storm Daniel approached, officials across eastern Libya held a flurry of crisis meetings, according to social media posts and accounts by officials. In Derna, a committee led by the head of the citys security directorate decided to evacuate several neighborhoods close to the waterfront well outside the eventual flood zone. A Sept. 9 order signed by eastern Libyas prime minister, Osama Hamad, declared a twoday holiday and told residents to limit their movements along roads. Workers from the local water and sanitation company started clearing drainage outlets with excavators along the coastline. Boy Scouts helped to evacuate a hospital and cleaned the streets. Video Zakaria Balsus and Libyan Red CrescentFacebook Red Crescent ambulances and police cars fanned out across waterfront neighborhoods, warning residents to leave. But in many instances, the authorities offered them no place to go. Families piled into cars, locals said, and headed inland to apartment blocks already filled with people waiting to ride out the storm. From his shoe store, Mohamed BinKhayal watched the warnings loop across television screens and social media as he tried to focus on work. He locked up the store when he heard the police cars urging his district to shelter in place, slamming the blue shutters closed. Its probably best to be at home, he recalled thinking as he climbed in his car and headed out. The voluntary coastal evacuations continued on Sept. 10. So did the curfew. Residents argued over whether to stay or go. Some didnt trust the weather reports others didnt trust the authorities. Dernas municipal council announced on Sept. 10 that the city would be shut down from 7 p.m. that night until 8 a.m. the next morning. Advertisement On social media, government accounts simultaneously urged people to evacuate their neighborhoods and to obey the curfew. On the streets, a video shows armed security forces walking alongside emergency vehicles as loudspeakers blared All citizens must remain in their houses. Video Nada BentalebTikTok A curfew would clear the roads for emergency vehicles and such, said Douma, the water minister, explaining the governments rationale. Share this article Share Abdul Gader Faraj, a nurse in Derna, was starting to worry about his family. He was 700 miles to the west, in Misrata, where he had taken their eldest son for cancer treatment. His wife, Fatima, and their other two children had been told to evacuate their home on the coast in Derna. He was relieved when Fatima called her father to come pick them up, as the sun sank in the sky and the wind harried the trees on the seafront. Their neighbor, Ali, took his wife and children to his inlaws near the center of the city, Faraj said, then went to shelter with his parents further up in the valley. Videos from later that evening show emergency vehicles trying to make their way through the driving storm. Boy Scouts were still cleaning the valley in the dark, their yellow raincoats fluttering in the wind. Video Derna Zoom and Derna NowFacebook In interviews after the storm, families described sheltering in place, steeling themselves for a long night. Children packed onto sofas and stretched out on living room floors, some excited to be with their cousins for a sleepover, others overtired and tearful. Parents stirred dinner pots and prepared school bags for the new term. On a street running down to the seashore, 43yearold Abdulrazzak Mustafa stepped outside briefly to check on the rains, then slipped back inside. His two youngest children had fallen asleep in front of the television. He picked them up gently and carried them to their beds. Abdulrazzak Mustafas phone barely stopped ringing through the swelling storm, as nervous relatives across the city checked in again and again. Shortly before midnight, Mohamed BinKhayal texted his brother Mustafa to see if he needed help. Abdul Gader Faraj called his wife. Everyone, it seemed, was safe. The incomprehensible part of this entire tragedy is the curfew imposed by the Derna security directorate from the start of the storm, said Hanan Salah, associate director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. This effectively trapped people in their homes and from then on, they stood no chance. Advertisement No one knew anything Around midnight, the cellphone network crashed and the power failed. Derna was plunged into darkness. Every familys world shrank Suddenly, no one knew anything about anyone else, Abdulrazzak Mustafa said. At the Wadi Bou Mansour dam, there was only one guard on duty that night, according to Claudia Gazzini, the International Crisis Groups senior analyst for Libya, who interviewed him and officials in Tripolis Water Resources Ministry for a recent report. The rain had reached a frightening intensity by midnight. Water was rushing down the valley into the center of the city, spilling over into adjacent streets. The dam was filling up. The guard told Gazzini he called his immediate supervisor at the Water Resources Ministry in Derna, who relayed the warning to Benghazi. Advertisement An official at the ministry in Benghazi told her that he notified Tripoli of the worsening situation. At 112 a.m. on Sept. 11, a message was posted on Facebook, but the intended recipients were already cut off from the outside world. The Ministry of Water Resources in Tripoli assures citizens that the Derna dam is safe and that rumors about it being broken are false, the message read. The dams are in good condition and things are still under control. By this point, they said they had already lost contact with the dams supervisors in Derna. Residents used different words to describe the sound they heard around 3 a.m. Some called it a boom, others a roar. One man said it sounded like the horizon had popped. Security camera footage shows a wave rushing so fast through the streets that it dragged cars along with it. Entire houses were carried into the sea and asphalt was ripped from the sidewalks. Video Derna Zoom, Facebook Abdulrazzak Mustafa struggles even now to understand the strength he mustered in that moment, forcing their door shut against the wave as he held his screaming children above him. Water had poured through the window and was rising past his chest. I couldnt think of myself, I knew I was going to die, he said. All I could do was pick them up and try to save them. Mohamed was trying his brothers cellphone again and again, but getting nothing. In neighborhoods with lower tides, people slipped in the streaming mud as they tried to flee, straining against wind gusts that knocked them backward. Some parents lost children underfoot, or tripped over bodies in the scramble. Hospitals that still functioned were inundated. One medic saw 100 patients in the first hour. By daylight, it was closer to 1,000. Across Libya, rumors of a tragedy were spreading, but Derna was still in blackout. At 239 p.m. on Sept. 11, Dernas municipal council confirmed on Facebook that the dams had burst. As the sun came up on the city, the scale of the damage was almost unimaginable. Mohamed finally found his brother Mustafa BinKhayal dead in the crush of his home. Across the road, another 20 of the brothers immediate relatives all sheltering in place together had drowned. Farajs wife and children survived, but their neighbor, Ali, who had evacuated his family to stay with their relatives, learned that he had taken them right into the path of the flood. When Faraj called to offer his condolences, the man could barely speak through sobs. He brought his own kids and wife to death by his own hands, Faraj said. He was trying to keep them safe. Advertisement An official in the Tripolibased agricultural ministry, Riyadh Jouha, agreed that people were not adequately warned of the dangers. But he said they were partly at fault for having built their homes along the river. They shouldnt just blame the government altogether, they should blame themselves too, he said. Among the dead were several police officers and Red Crescent workers involved in the curfew and evacuation efforts, according to witnesses and social media posts. More than 100 medical personnel were killed. So many lives were lost that day, and the people of Derna deserve in the very least to know why authorities who are meant to protect them failed them so miserably, said Salah, of Human Rights Watch. 4,267 people have been buried. Another 8,500 people are missing and presumed dead. Some families are still asking for news on Facebook, clinging to hope. There were two people who saw him, but we havent found him, wrote a woman looking for her husband. On his own page, Mohamed BinKhayal said the pain was now greatest for the living. It is the ones who survived in Derna who died, he wrote. Heba Farouk Mahfouz contributed to this report.|1

Their family was among those displaced by the recent floods in the Indian capitals Yamuna River.|Storms, floods, fires and other extreme weather events led to more than 43 million displacements involving children between 2016 and 2021, according to a United Nations report. More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10yearold Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. Arima, 7, left, eats breakfast with her brother Kartik, 4, as their mother Meera Devi looks on inside their shanti on the flood plain of Yamuna River, in New Delhi, India, Friday, Sept. 29, 2023. Their family were among the hundreds that were displaced by the recent floods in the Indian capitals Yamuna River. AP PhotoAltaf Qadri The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the oncefertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. Thats a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night, Ibrahim said. The miseries of long, drawnout disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report more than half of them in Somalia but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no preemptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in the future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify, said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the reports authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 201621 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically dont differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Genevabased nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring overlapping crises where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10yearold Garima Kumars family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we dont have a permanent home, Kumar said. Shiv Kumar, left, accompanies his daughter Garima, 10, to her school as they walk on the flood plain of Yamuna River, in New Delhi, India, Friday, Sept. 29, 2023. Their family was among those displaced by the recent floods in the Indian capitals Yamuna River. AP PhotoAltaf Qadri The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month a process Garimas mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasnt had any work for over a month. The familys only income is the mothers 2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnambased expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasnt involved with the report. When youre desperate, you do things that you normally wouldnt do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they dont have the ability to stand up for themselves, she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become shockresponsive, portable and inclusive, to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering childrens needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work.

Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China.|Storms, floods, fires and other extreme weather events led to more than 43 million displacements involving children between 2016 and 2021, according to a United Nations report. Storms, floods, fires and other extreme weather events led to more than 43 million displacements involving children between 2016 and 2021, according to a United Nations report. More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10yearold Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the oncefertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. Thats a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night, Ibrahim said. The miseries of long, drawnout disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report more than half of them in Somalia but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no preemptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in the future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify, said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the reports authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 201621 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically dont differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Genevabased nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring overlapping crises where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10yearold Garima Kumars family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we dont have a permanent home, Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month a process Garimas mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasnt had any work for over a month. The familys only income is the mothers 2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnambased expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasnt involved with the report. When youre desperate, you do things that you normally wouldnt do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they dont have the ability to stand up for themselves, she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become shockresponsive, portable and inclusive, to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering childrens needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But were just not working fast enough, Healy said. Ghosal reported from Hanoi, Vietnam, Fassett reported from Seattle.

There has been recent flooding in China, wildfires in Canada, California and Hawaii. Further, there have been hurricanes in the Caribbean and landslides in India. Many factors go into the effect a natural disaster will have on a community. Some variables include the magnitude of the event, landscape of the location hit, amount of resources that a community has, population, protective measures or protocols in place and the amount of government action. Michael Bitton, assistant professor in the faculty of Geography and Environmental Studies, explained in regard to vulnerable communities in the case of natural disasters, These are the people who have less expensive homes, built lower to the ground, on flood plains and therefore far more susceptible to flooding. Though the safety of many communities is trusted in the hands of the local government, they sometimes have external pressures that cause environmental wellbeing and protection of their citizens to come second. For instance, prior to the 2010 catastrophic earthquake in Hati the country faced a dramatic increase in population. Since there was a drastic demand for housing, deforestation occurred in order to build new houses. This had significant environmental impacts. The roots of trees stabilize the soil they are in, so once they are removed the ground is vulnerable to shifts in tectonic plates. This results in disasters such as landslides and earthquakes. The earthquake in Hati led to 190,000 homes destroyed and a quarter million lives lost. There are many lowcost tools accessible to assist in understanding terrains and the effect certain developments will have on them. Steven Roberts, associate professor in the faculty of Geography and Environmental Studies at Laurier, touched on his background in spatial analysis tools, geographic information science and landuse planning. He explained that, there are ways to do this stuff with little resources. You dont have to have big investments to be able to tap into some of the tools. Its whether or not theres support to do that and whether or not the decision making processes are transparent enough to want to know the answers. Often the answers will not be what the people in power want to hear. The effects of climate change can be seen in the wide range of increasing environmental impacts around the world. In California, the rise in temperature has resulted in vegetation drying out quicker and more thoroughly. This has caused an ongoing battle with wildfires, destroying the natural environment and making the naturally tectonically active region even more vulnerable to other natural disasters. Similar to the effects of deforestation in Haiti, Bitton stated that, The elimination of plants makes that landscape far more susceptible to flooding washouts, mudslides, and landslides since all the land that used to be held in place by the roots of the plants, can now erode and tumble down slope much easier. Not only will there be more natural disasters occuring, but they will have a greater impact. With Canadas recent battles against wildfires, the effects of global warming are evident. Just this year, the eastern coast of Canada was hit by Hurricane Lee, a tropical storm that left 170,000 Canadians without power for days. With sea surface temperatures rising and warmer waters coming further north, Canada could be receiving more hurricanes and stronger storms each year. As Bitton illustrates, when I think about GG231 Risks and Disasters, my big goal is for people to be aware that different locations may have very different disaster risks. The big ideas are to understandknow why there are certain risks in certain places so that people can better prepare for their specific vulnerabilities and help the masses, especially the less fortunate, prepare since preparation can decrease the loss of life, if nothing else.|1

At least, thats the strategy First Onsite is taking. The restoration firm intends to mobilize quicker local residential and commercial repairs by opening a new office in the Shawinigan and TroisRivires regions of Qubec, an area prone to flood damage. The firm plans to onboard 15 staff and hire 20 to 40 subcontractors in the first year of its new location. The claims industry is an industry where you cant really plan you have had people on call, Valrie Bouchard, directrice principale, dveloppement des affaires at First Onsite, told Canadian Underwriter. The new local office serving a floodprone area could help make clients repairs happen quicker, she said. We had high demands in Three Rivers, Bouchard told CU. In the past, we wouldnt see big disasters and big rains during the summer. But now we see that. Parts of Qubec saw dangerous flash flooding this July. Weather stations near TroisRivires were reporting rainfall rates over 10 mm an hour north of the St. Lawrence River, the Weather Network reported. In the spring of 2017, spring snowfall and heavy rain caused floods across Quebec, including Shawinigan and TroisRivires. Floodwater washed out portions of Route 155 and flooded residences, causing regions to declare states of emergency. Heavy rain is forecast this weekend in the region of Mauricie, north of TroisRivires. Precipitation could range from 50 mm to 80 mm on Friday and Saturday. The federal government warns water accumulation could be significant on roads and in lowlying areas. But the general restoration industry is facing a shortage of available and qualified talent. This talent shortage, coupled with supply chain issues, has caused longer cycle times for largescale repairs, although it was worse before, Bouchard said. TroisRivires is the next step in the restoration firms expansion plans, enabling the company to respond quickly to its clients major restoration projects. The region is home to commercial clients spanning from retirement homes, to manufacturing, transportation and logistics industries. The firm does have offices in Montral and Qubec City, but until the new office opened, they didnt have anything in the middle. In order to act very quickly for those clients who give us a lot of work during the year, it was so much easier to have an office there, so we will have people on location to do everything, Bouchard said. Having an office in between the two major cities will save recovery teams about oneandahalf hours worth of response time when they need to be onsite, Bouchard explained.

Tous dans le mme bateau Pratiquement tout le Qubec sera balay par ce qui aura des allures de tempte dautomne que lon peut voir chaque anne , selon le mtorologue. a va devenir un seul complexe dpressionnaire, amplifi de lnergie de Philippe , alors rtrograde au statut de tempte posttropicale. Le Grand Montral, la Montrgie, la rgion de Qubec, le BasSaintLaurent, la Mauricie et le LacSaintJean pourraient recevoir de 50 80 mm de pluie au total, selon les prvisions. On pourrait mme dpasser la barre des 80 mm et sapprocher des 100 mm localement dans les terrains montagneux au nord du fleuve SaintLaurent, notamment dans les Laurentides, Lanaudire, la Mauricie, dans le parc des Laurentides au nord de Qubec et dans Charlevoix. Lest du Qubec sera moins arros on prvoit de 30 50 mm. Lbas, cest plus les vents violents qui vont tre surveiller, donc qui pourraient causer des impacts , prvient M. Bgin. Des rafales de 90 kmh pourraient tre atteintes la pointe est de la Gaspsie et Septles. Si lon compare au passage de la tempte Lee en septembre, qui a caus plus de peur que de mal, il devrait pleuvoir moins, mais venter plus dans ces secteurs, rsumetil. Ailleurs comme en Abitibi, en Outaouais, en Estrie ou en ChaudireAppalaches, les prcipitations totales seront plus prs de 50 mm. Faible risque dinondation Au chapitre des bonnes nouvelles, nous ne sommes pas en priode de forte amplitude de mares, les sols sont secs et les cours deau ne sont pas trs levs, tant donn le peu daverses dernirement. Le risque dinondation apparat faible ce momentci, selon la Scurit civile, qui dit toutefois surveiller de prs la situation. Retour la ralit En dbut de semaine prochaine, le retour des tempratures prs et mme sous les normales causera tout un contraste avec la chaleur phnomnale des derniers jours. LAbitibi pourrait mme voir ses premiers flocons de neige de lanne, tt lundi. Encore jeudi, des records quotidiens de chaleur ont t battus Qubec 25,8 C 15 h comparativement 23,3 C en 1926 et Montral 28 C 15 h comparativement 26 C en 2005. Mercredi, plusieurs records mensuels ont aussi t battus, notamment avec un mercure 29,3 C Montral. Cest historique dans le sens o on a battu des records mensuels, donc a veut dire quil na jamais fait aussi chaud pour une journe du mois doctobre plusieurs endroits , souligne JeanPhilippe Bgin.|1

Les inondations et les glissements de terrain sont relativement frquents en Inde et y causent de nombreux dgts, notamment pendant la mousson, de juin septembre. Mais, en octobre, la mousson est dhabitude quasiment termine. Situation catastrophique Les inondations provoques par les dbordements de lacs glaciaires, souvent accompagnes de chutes de roches, sont plus frquentes mesure que les tempratures mondiales augmentent et que la fonte des glaces saccentue. Des prcipitations intenses ont conduit cette situation catastrophique au Sikkim , a expliqu Miriam Jackson, une scientifique spcialise dans la surveillance des glaces dans les rgions de lHimalaya.

The city received 56 mm of rainfall, with higher amounts recorded in certain areas. The floods affected various parts of the city, including newly constructed flyovers. Ferry services were suspended, and a cricket match was washed out. The India Meteorological Department issued a warning of thunderstorms and heavy rain in the region until October 4. Civic body to renovate 1.3km stormwater drain The Cuttack Municipal Corporation CMC in India has planned to renovate a secondary storm water drain in the city. The 1.3 km drain, built in 1987, is meant to clear rainwater during monsoons but often gets clogged with waste and garbage. The renovation project, estimated to cost Rs 82.29 crore, will include a concrete base and a 20fthigh concrete wall. Barricades will also be placed to prevent entry of animals and people. Construction is expected to begin in November and be completed within a year. Nod to silt removal in Derabassi The Punjab government has allowed farmers in Mohali to remove sand from their agricultural fields due to a change in the course of the Ghaggars river. This decision provides relief to farmers who were previously unable to remove the sand due to strict policies. Farmers have until October 5 to remove the sand, following standard operating procedures. The disposal of the sand will be done through district mining officers via auction. This move aims to support farmers affected by floods and facilitate agricultural activities. GUWAHATI The five narrowed rivulets that carry stormwater of the entire city due to rapid urbanisation, depletion of forest as well as tree cover and encroachment across the 18 hills in Guwahati over the decades are the reasons behind the worsening urban floods over the years, experts said.A retired professor of Gauhati University , who did indepth studies on urban floods, said Guwahati witnessed heavy changes particularly in the last over four decades after the human settlement increased in the city following the shifting of the capital from Shillong to Dispur in 197273.With the increase in human settlement, forest cover decreased, urbanisation was rapid and rivulets lost the capacity to carry stormwater. People will have to abandon the city soon if the government does not formulate a concrete policy to save it as priority and the city dwellers do not join hands with the government, the retired professor said.IIT Guwahati professor for water resources of the department of civil engineering, Arup Kumar Sarma, said desilting the drains by the Guwahati Municipal Corporation alone cannot solve the worsening urban floods in the city until scientific measures, like placing debris control screen and creating silting basin at the inlet point of the drains, are not adopted by the government.He said apart from adopting ecological management practices like increasing grassland, tree cover and vegetation, steps to prevent waste and sediment going into the drains should also be taken.He said creating a silting basin at the confluence of the primary and secondary drains can also be an effective way to curb sedimentation as the basin will curb the velocity of flow and deposition of silt at the basin.Sarma in a research paper published a few years ago said optimal ecological management practices like increasing grassland, tree cover, vegetation and construction of detention drains should be followed to mitigate floods.We also published the following articles recently|1

Basement apartment living is a reality of the New York City housing stock and will continue to be, given our ongoing housing crisis, Morse said.|Listen 8 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save When Shekar Krishnan walked his young children to school in a downpour Sept. 29, confronted by flooded streets, his mind went to worrying about the estimated 100,000 residents of illegal basement apartments across New York City. During tropical rains in 2021, 11 people in the city councilmans home borough of Queens drowned in their homes, and now, nearly as much water was falling, and nearly as quickly. But this time, no one died. Firefighters rescued residents trapped in half a dozen basements, but otherwise, the storms toll was limited to buildings and property, as well as the citys dense transportation network, once again brought to a waterlogged standstill. What made the difference Sheer luck, if you ask Krishnan, a Democrat who represents the Elmhurst and Jackson Heights neighborhoods of Queens. Advertisement A week after New Yorkers endured paralyzing floods for the second time in three years, leaders in some of the hardesthit communities arent taking comfort in the fact that no one died. They say there are signs that, despite lessons learned from Hurricanes Ida and Sandy, the city remains unprepared to manage such sudden deluges and protect the public especially those in unregulated basement apartments. Torrential rain inundated parts of New York on Friday, causing heavy flash flooding in Brooklyn. Residents were forced to avoid flooded roads and subways. Video Joyce KohThe Washington Post This time, residents say they were caught off guard by a rainstorm that prompted little more than a travel advisory from city emergency officials less than 12 hours in advance. The crisis prompted the city comptroller, Brad Lander D, to launch an investigation Thursday into New Yorks ability to manage extreme rainfall. City emergency management officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a statement responding to the comptrollers inquiry, Mayor Eric Adams D said recent drainage improvements and the swift action of city workers saved lives. Advertisement Community leaders say the storm serves as yet another warning that the city needs to adapt to extreme weather and do more to reach vulnerable residents in an emergency, despite the challenges. The city should be reevaluating Are they getting to the right people in the right time said Sadia Rahman, deputy director of policy for Chhaya Community Development, a group that works in New Yorks South Asian and IndoCaribbean communities. An unusual forecast meant a short window to warn The first sign that floods could be imminent arrived late Sept. 27, only about 36 hours before the downpours arrival. While past floods came from tropical systems and with many days notice, the forecast for this one materialized differently and much more quickly. For a few days, weather forecasting models had shown the potential for a soaking rain, but that night, detailed rainfall projections were eyepopping A bulls eye of half a foot of rain, if not more, over the tristate region. Stalled offshore moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia was forecast to stream toward the coast and meet a highaltitude disturbance moving in slowly from the west. Advertisement Nicholas Bassill, a University of Albany meteorologist affiliated with the New York State Mesonet, a weather observation network, fired off an urgent email to New York state emergency management officials just before midnight. New York City was at the center, Bassill recalled. It was, he said, the worst spot for that much heavy rain to fall. The next day, state and city officials began sharing social media posts about the potential for heavy rain, and Gov. Kathy Hochul D spoke about the risks on a talk radio station during the evening commute. New York City officials shared a travel advisory that warned of widespread rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with some amounts surpassing 5 inches and enough to inundate lowlying and floodprone areas. Potential street flooding may also occur. Widespread travel impacts are possible, particularly during the morning commute, the advisory said. Advertisement But many residents said they didnt receive that message or didnt take it to suggest the scale of what unfolded. A widespread 7 to 8 inches of rain fell across Brooklyn and Queens, much of it within a few morning hours, setting a record for daily rainfall at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Adams faced criticism for not speaking in public until close to noon Friday, hours after the heaviest rain fell. Share this article Share I was only aware of messaging that came out the day of the storms, said Crystal Hudson D, a city council member who represents the Prospect Heights, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill sections of Brooklyn. I think overall, the city wasnt really prepared. Storm exposes lessons not learned It felt familiar for many communities that had faced the same sudden severe flooding during Ida, which killed nearly 50 people across the Northeast in September 2021, including 13 people in New York City. Though significant study and resources had been put toward preventing such a disaster from recurring, last Fridays floods brought some of the same problems, if not the same death toll. Advertisement After Ida, for example, Mayor Bill de Blasios administration said it would hire an extremeweather coordinator to ensure that the city had a better, and earlier, handle on forecasts for storms and other disasters. But city officials did not respond to questions about whether the Adams administration had filled such a position. A recent search of a city payroll database showed no positions with weather in their title. The New York Daily News reported Wednesday that the job is unfilled. After Ida, the city also embarked on an effort to better prepare residents of basement apartments for floods. Though such dwellings are technically illegal under state law, the citys surging cost of living means they are the only affordable, if unsafe, option for many immigrants and lowincome families. The effort included adding notifications about basement flooding risks to the citys Notify NYC app. Adams stressed that they were a key line of communication the city used before and during the floods on Sept. 29. But the Adams administration did not answer questions from The Post about when any such alerts were sent out or how many people subscribe to them. Advertisement Community leaders who work with basement apartment residents expressed doubt that such an alert would have reached many of them. Most face language barriers, have limited access to technology and work nontraditional hours, said Sylvia Morse, program manager for policy at the Pratt Center for Community Development in Brooklyn. Instead, many of those people were so traumatized during the Ida floods that they have heightened anxiety and risk awareness anytime rain starts falling, she said. Those residents survived last weeks flood but still experienced yet another loss, Rahman said. The torrential rains wrought an enormous amount of damage in Queens neighborhoods such as Woodside and Elmhurst, which also experienced some of the most intense floods during Ida, Morse said. Losing your home is the secondworst thing that can happen to people, and it happened again, she said. Advertisement A campaign to legalize basement apartments began long before Ida and has intensified in the past two years. Along with efforts to improve storm water infrastructure so the city can withstand heavier rain, advocates say, reforms to New Yorks housing law could have the biggest impact on flood preparedness. Basement apartment living is a reality of the New York City housing stock and will continue to be, given our ongoing housing crisis, Morse said. Legalizing the dwellings, so they can be regulated for safety, is the first step to reducing the risk from flooding, she said. So far from where we need to be Going forward, city and state leaders stressed that the floods are the latest sign of the threats that New Yorkers face from climate change. Warming global temperatures mean the air can hold more moisture and produce heavier downpours. Climate scientists have long predicted that more precipitation would fall in fewer storm events in the Northeast, including New York, in a warmer world. Advertisement Jackie Bray, commissioner of New York states Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, said people need to prepare for the storms of tomorrow, not just those of the past. There are some storms where youre going to have a days notice or a day and a halfs notice. There are some storms where youre going to have a weeks notice, she said. We have to be prepared for events that have a days notice or 12 hours notice or no notice. Krishnan said the storms strength and damage underscore how New York City needs to do more to confront extreme weather. He toured flooding damage as the rain fell and said some of the worst flooding he saw was inside Elmhurst Hospital, a public facility in Queens. This storm affected everyone every single aspect of our public infrastructure, he said. If thats the case, then we are so far from where we need to be to really addressing and protecting ourselves from the climate emergency that we face.|1

The flood began in the early hours of Wednesday, when water overflowed a mountain lake. It smashed through a major hydroelectric dam downstream and then poured into the valley below, where it killed at least 41 people and forced thousands to flee their homes. Police said that 22 of the dead were found kilometres miles downriver in West Bengal state, while 100 people are still missing. The disaster underscores a climate dilemma thats pitted local environmental activists who say the dams are too dangerous against authorities pursuing a national green energy agenda for years. It wasnt clear what triggered the deadly flood, the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Experts pointed to intense rain, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon, as possible contributors. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. But the design and placement of the sixyearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built as part of an Indian push to expand hydropower energy. Local activists argued that the location was too dangerous and that the dam didnt include enough safety measures. A report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority in 2019 had identified Lhonak Lake as highly vulnerable to flooding that could breach dams and cause extensive damage to life and property. The dams operator, and local agencies responsible for dam safety, did not respond to requests for comment Friday. Rising temperatures cause glaciers to melt faster, making dam failures and catastrophic floods more likely, but India is counting on such dams to meet its ambitious clean energy goals. The government aims to increase Indias hydroelectric dam output by half, to 70,000 megawatts, by 2030, and has approved hundreds of new hydroelectric dams to be built across the Himalayan region. But the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather, driven in part by climate change, puts many dams and the people living downstream from them at risk. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. A 2016 study found that over a fifth of the 177 dams built close to Himalayan glaciers could fail if glacial lakes burst, including the Teesta 3 dam. We knew that this was coming, said Gyatso Lepcha, general secretary of Affected Citizens of Teesta, an environmental organisation based in Sikkim. The same can happen with other dams also, he wrote in a statement that called for a safety review of all dams in the state. The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost US1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operation in 2017. Despite being the biggest project in the state, there were no early warning systems installed even though the glacier overflowing was a known risk, said Himanshu Thakkar of the nongovernmental organization South Asian Network for Rivers, Dams and People. Thakkar said authorities failed to apply the lessons from a 2021 dam breach in Himalayan state of Uttarakhand that killed 81 people, allowing an eerily similar disaster to occur. Indias National Disaster Management Agency said Friday that it plans to set up early warning systems at most of Indias 56 known atrisk glacial lakes.|1

AP Nearly three months after severe flooding inundated Vermonts capital city, Montpelier businesses launched an event Friday to celebrate how much theyve rebuilt and remind the public not to forget them as they struggle to make a complete comeback. The small city of about 8,000 is celebrating its ongoing recovery with food trucks, music and street performers in hopes of drawing visitors downtown and giving shops a chance to sell their merchandise in sidewalk sales.

AP PhotoLisa Rathke Rain will likely fall at times during the twoday event, although Trautz said a weather forecaster has assured organizers that heavy rains will likely be west of the city. Trautz said at least 125 Montpelier businesses were damaged in the July flooding that filled basements and lower floors of businesses with water and obscured vehicles and all but the tops of parking meters downtown. Some resident canoed and kayaked along main streets, while others slogged through the waisthigh water to survey the scene. Since then, 15 to 20 businesses have reopened and 10 have officially closed, Trautz said. She estimates that 80 will reopen but it will take a long time. What were trying to do is also give businesses an opportunity to sell their merchandise and be recognized and keep the attention on Montpelier because this is not over, Trautz said. She also noted that the fall, a popular time for tourists who flock to the state to see colorful foliage, is when businesses traditionally make the money that gets them through the end of the year. The celebration includes an art walk on Friday evening, the farmers market on Saturday morning, and the Taste of Montpelier Food Festival in the afternoon with 20 food trucks offering fare from around Vermont. A singing group will hold a benefit for Montpelier flood relief on the Statehouse lawn on Saturday afternoon and the Kellogg Hubbard Library will celebrate its own grand reopening with crafts, snacks, and the finale of its fundraising auction.

By Oct. 2, the new system had been installed and was operational. The temporary system has currently eliminated downstream flows caused by seepage. Henri Mulder, a geotechnical engineer with the USACE South Pacific Division who works out of the Isabella Dam Safety Modification Project Resident Office, stressed that the seepage is not a risk to the safety or structural integrity of the dam. All dams experience seepage, said Mulder. However, the elevated seepage levels were seeing this year are the result of record precipitation and the higher lake levels that resulted. The Sacramento District will continue assessing the Isabella Dam seepage to determine if more permanent changes need to be made to increase the pumping systems capacity. This pump is a temporary solution, said Mulder. After further evaluation, we plan to install a more permanent solution within six to twelve months. The Sacramento District engaged in extensive preconstruction modeling of both inflows and outflows at Isabella Lake before the recent modifications to the dam, which included an improved filter and drain system. And although the current collected seepage levels exceed preconstruction estimates, the system is working as designed. During design, models represent our best estimates of site conditions, so there are always adjustments to be made after construction, said Mulder. Thats why we execute fill plans after finishing a big project like this. Completed in 1953, Isabella Dam is located approximately 40 miles northeast of Bakersfield. The reservoir is impounded by two earthen dams on the Kern River and Hot Springs Valley. Today, Isabella Lake and its dams reduce flood risk for Bakersfield and the surrounding region and is a primary water source for water users throughout Kern County. The Isabella Dam Safety Modification Project addresses overtopping, seismic and seepage issues identified with Isabella Lakes main and auxiliary dams and spillways to reduce the likelihood of dam failure. Construction of the dam modifications began in 2017 with the relocation of facilities within the project footprint, and the project achieved substantial completion in 2022.|1

Tourist arrivals over the eightday break that ended Friday reached more than 932,000, taking the daily average to about 84 of 2019s in the same period, according to official data from the city. About 76 of the visitors were from mainland China, the data show. Visitors were spending big, too. Gaming revenue from massmarket tourists, now the biggest driver of Macau casinos growth following Chinas crackdown on highrollers, is likely to have fully recovered to prepandemic levels, according to estimates by Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Co. Mass gaming income may reach about 110 of the 2019 level next year, driving casinos profits to a full recovery by mid2024, according to a JPMorgan estimate last month. Macaus boom highlights Chinas surging tourism demand, fueled by revenge travel and a shift in consumer preferences to more experiencerelated spending in response to an economic slowdown at home. The latter coincides with the hubs efforts to wean itself off its reliance on highrollers and their facilitators and transform into an entertainment hub akin to the Las Vegas Strip.

New York City does not wait for a storm to prepare we are already several steps ahead, said Mayor Adams. Our emergency management teams, first responders, and key city agencies are fully activated and tightly coordinated to face the coming rains headon. I urge every New Yorker especially those in areas more susceptible to flooding to stay alert by signing up for Notify NYC now. We have activated the Flash Flood Emergency Plan in anticipation of heavy rainfall as we head into the weekend, said NYCEM Commissioner Iscol. Our primary concern is a sixhour period of moderate to heavy rain late Friday night through early Saturday afternoon. While widespread, major impacts are not expected, I want to stress the vital need for all New Yorkers, especially those in lowlying and floodprone areas, including belowgrade living spaces, to take precautions, sign up for emergency notifications via Notify NYC, pay attention to changes in the forecast, and heed official guidance to keep yourselves and your loved ones safe. The National Weather Service has issued a Flood Watch citywide, effective Saturday from 200 AM until 800 PM. Moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms are forecast to begin late Friday night through Saturday afternoon, with a few inches of rain expected over a roughly sixhour period. Locally, upwards of four inches of rainfall is possible. Where the heaviest rainfall rates develop, flooding could be locally significant causing disruption to transportation flooding of basements, firstfloor residences and businesses, and underground infrastructure and posing an elevated threat to life. Lowlying, poor drainage and frequent flood locations may be especially vulnerable. Widespread, major impacts are not expected. Lingering showers may continue into early Saturday evening, with dry conditions expected by Saturday night. Breezy winds develop Saturday afternoon, with a few gusts likely Sunday. Temperatures will cool into the upper 40s by Monday morning. Safety Tips Allow for extra travel time. New Yorkers are urged to use public transportation. If you must drive, drive slowly. Use major streets or highways for travel whenever possible. If you live in a basement apartment in a floodprone area, prepare to move to a place higher than the flood waters if experiencing rising waters andor if you receive a warning from Notify NYC or the National Weather Service. Do not drive into flooded streets or enter flooded subway stations. Six inches of moving water can knock over an adult. Avoid stepping in floodwater if you see it. Check on friends, relatives, and neighbors, especially older adults as well as people with disabilities, access and functional needs, or health conditions. Help them to prepare if needed. Stay informed. Before and during an emergency, the city will send emergency alerts and updates to New Yorkers through various channels, including Notify NYC. Sign up for emergency notifications on the Notify NYC website at govNotifyNYC or call 311. You can also follow NotifyNYC on social media. New Yorkers should follow the National Weather Service forecast and guidance listed in watches, warnings, and advisories on the National Weather Service website. New York City Emergency Management, in coordination with partners and other city agencies, has activated the comprehensive Flash Flood Emergency Plan and is actively collaborating with the National Weather Service to monitor conditions. As part of this proactive approach, crews from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, New York City Department of Sanitation, and New York City Department of Transportation are already on the ground, inspecting and clearing catch basins in neighborhoods and thoroughfares that are particularly susceptible to flooding. Multiple city agencies have been convened on a Flash Flood Emergency Plan Steering Committee as integral components and are not only preparing in advance but also poised to respond swiftly and effectively to emergent situations.

What is a glacial lake outburst flood A glacial lake outburst flood, or GLOF, is the sudden release of water that has collected in former glacier beds. Climate change is not only driving the creation of glacial lakes, but also can produce the conditions that result in dam breaches. The most dangerous basins ... do not always host the most, or the largest, glacial lakes, the authors wrote.|Indian rescuers are searching for over 100 people missing in a flash flood caused by a glacial lake bursting its banks, a risk scientists warn is increasing with climate change. Agence FrancePresse explains what glacial lake outburst floods are and the risks they pose, particularly in parts of Asia. What is a glacial lake outburst flood A glacial lake outburst flood, or GLOF, is the sudden release of water that has collected in former glacier beds. These lakes are formed by the retreat of glaciers, a naturally occurring phenomenon that has been turbocharged by the warmer temperatures of humancaused climate change. Glacier melt is often channeled into rivers, but ice or the buildup of debris can form what is effectively a natural dam, behind which a glacial lake builds. If these natural dams are breached, large quantities of water can be released suddenly from the lakes, causing devastating flooding. What causes these breaches The natural dams holding back glacial lakes can be breached for a variety of reasons, explained Lauren Vargo, a glacier expert and scientist at the Antarctic Research Centre in New Zealand. Causes include an avalanche of snow, or a landslide causing a wave in the lake, or overfilling of the lake ... from rain or the glacier melting, she told AFP. Sometimes the dam has been gradually degraded over time or is ruptured by an event such as an earthquake. The breaches are highly unpredictable, because they can be caused by so many different factors, she said. What is the impact of climate change Climate change is driving the disappearance of glaciers, with half the Earths 215,000 glaciers projected to melt by the end of the century, even if warming can be capped at 1.5 degrees Celsius. The volume of glacial lakes has jumped by 50 in 30 years, according to a 2020 study based on satellite data. The more lakes that form and the larger they grow, the greater the risk they pose to populations downstream. Climate change is not only driving the creation of glacial lakes, but also can produce the conditions that result in dam breaches. The flooding can be caused by glaciers melting or these big rainfall events, said Vargo. We know thats happening more because of climate change. How dangerous are these floods The particular danger of GLOFs lies in their unpredictability. The probability of a lake releasing a GLOF is difficult to accurately quantify without detailed and localized studies, a study of the problem globally warned this year. The study, published in Nature Communications, found that 15 million people live within 50 kilometers 31 miles of a glacial lake and within one kilometer of potential flooding from a breach. The risk was greatest in High Mountains Asia, an area that covers parts of 12 countries, including India, Pakistan, China and Nepal. That is partly because more people live closer to glacial lakes in the region than in other parts of the world, making warning times even shorter. But it also reflects the vulnerability of those populations, who may be poorer and less prepared to deal with the sudden arrival of catastrophic floodwaters. The most dangerous basins ... do not always host the most, or the largest, glacial lakes, the authors wrote. Rather it is the high number of people and the reduced capacity of those people to cope with disaster that plays a key role in determining overall GLOF danger. Thousands of people, for example, have been killed by glacier lake outburst floods in High Mountains Asia but only a handful in North Americas Pacific Northwest, even though that region has twice as many glacial lakes. Experts have called for more research on the risks posed by GLOFs, particularly in the Andean region, which remains comparatively understudied, but also for better preparedness. But then theres the larger part of what we can do in terms of reducing emissions, to try to slow down climate change and reduce the threats of this from growing even more, Vargo said.|1

There have been 43.1 million internal displacements of children across 44 countries between 2016 and 2021, due to events such as droughts and wildfires, according to the organization. UNICEF recorded the most weatherrelated child displacements in the East Asia and Pacific region due to the combination of hazards there, followed by South Asia. Among the countries with the highest in absolute numbers were China and the Philippines, due to their exposure to extreme weather events, their large child populations and evacuation capacities.

The design and placement of the 6yearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built. The dams operator, and local agencies responsible for dam safety, did not respond to requests for comment Friday. India passed a dam safety law in 2021, but Teesta 3 is not on a list of dams whose safety is monitored by Indias top dam regulator. Parts of northern Bangladesh along the Teesta River also flooded Friday as water traveled from Sikkim, local media reported.|NEW DELHI AP Hundreds of rescuers dug through slushy debris and fastflowing, icy water Friday in a search for survivors after a glacial lake overflowed and burst through a dam in Indias Himalayan north, a disaster that many had warned was possible for years. The flood began in the early hours of Wednesday, when water overflowed a mountain lake. It smashed through a major hydroelectric dam downstream and then poured into the valley below, where it killed at least 41 people, carrying bodies miles downstream, and forced thousands to flee their homes. It wasnt clear what triggered the deadly flood, the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Experts pointed to intense rain, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon, as possible contributors. But the disaster also underscores a climate dilemma that pits local environmental activists who say dams in the Himalayas are too dangerous against authorities pursuing a national green energy agenda. The design and placement of the 6yearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built. A report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority in 2019 had identified Lhonak Lake as highly vulnerable to flooding that could breach dams and cause extensive damage to life and property. The dams operator, and local agencies responsible for dam safety, did not respond to requests for comment Friday. India is counting on hydroelectric dams to meet ambitious clean energy goals that are part of a global effort to slow climate change. The government aims to increase Indias hydro power by half by 2030, to 70,000 megawatts, and has approved hundreds of new dams across the countrys mountainous north. But the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather, driven in part by climate change, puts many dams and the people living downstream from them at risk. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. Rising temperatures also cause glaciers to melt faster, putting more pressure on dams. A 2016 study found that over a fifth of the 177 dams built close to Himalayan glaciers in five countries were at risk from glacial lakes, including the Teesta 3 dam. We knew that this was coming, said Gyatso Lepcha, general secretary of Affected Citizens of Teesta, an environmental organization based in Sikkim, wrote in a statement that called for a safety review of all dams in the state. The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost 1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operation in 2017. But local activists argued that the dam didnt have enough safety features. Despite being the biggest project in the state, there were no early warning systems installed even though the glacier overflowing was a known risk, said Himanshu Thakkar of the nongovernmental organization South Asian Network for Rivers, Dams and People. Thakkar said authorities failed to apply the lessons from a 2021 dam breach in Himalayan state of Uttarakhand that killed 81 people, allowing an eerily similar disaster to occur. India passed a dam safety law in 2021, but Teesta 3 is not on a list of dams whose safety is monitored by Indias top dam regulator. Indias National Disaster Management Agency said Friday that it plans to set up early warning systems at most of Indias 56 known atrisk glacial lakes. Parts of northern Bangladesh along the Teesta River also flooded Friday as water traveled from Sikkim, local media reported. The waters are expected to rise more, as the countrys weather office forecast possible heavy rains in coming days. In Sikkim, more than 2,000 people were rescued after Wednesdays floods, the state Dsaster Management Authority said, adding that authorities set up 26 relief camps for more than 22,000 people. One soldier was previously reported missing was rescued, and the bodies of seven have been found, state police said. Eleven bridges in the Lachan Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said. The army said it was providing medical aid and phone connectivity to civilians in the areas of Chungthang, Lachung and Lachen, and local media reported that said the army was erecting temporary bridges to bring food to affected areas. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state, and record rains in northern India killed more than 100 people over two weeks in July.

Its a symbolic kind of reopening celebration, like were turning a page here. . Businesses are reopening every week. Rain will likely fall at times during the twoday event, although Trautz said a weather forecaster has assured organizers that heavy rains will likely be west of the city. Trautz said at least 125 Montpelier businesses were damaged in the July flooding that filled basements and lower floors of businesses with water and obscured vehicles and all but the tops of parking meters downtown. Some resident canoed and kayaked along main streets, while others slogged through the waisthigh water to survey the scene. Since then, 15 to 20 businesses have reopened and 10 have officially closed, Trautz said. She estimates that 80 will reopen but it will take a long time. What were trying to do is also give businesses an opportunity to sell their merchandise and be recognized and keep the attention on Montpelier because this is not over, Trautz said. She also noted that the fall, a popular time for tourists who flock to the state to see colorful foliage, is when businesses traditionally make the money that gets them through the end of the year.

A West African drumming event takes place in front of City Hall at 6 p.m. followed by a play performed at Lost Nation Theater. Solonge Breceduong, visiting from Montreal, said Friday that she was initially surprised to see so many businesses closed, but then remembered the flood. I think that people here are very resilient. You can see the hope on their face, so I really like Vermont for that, she said. Kelly Tackett, owner of the childrens clothing shop Minikin, decided just last weekend that she would reopen. It was a rollercoaster of ups and downs of what to do, Tackett said Friday, adding that it took her two months to figure out the right way to submit a loan application to the Small Business Administration. Without any assistance, I didnt think there was any way I could pull this off starting from scratch again. Trautz said many more businesses expect to open in the next couple of weeks.

Nathan Cullen chatted with a crew from Ksik GeoSpatial Aerial Survey Company who had flown two of their planes to the Williams Lake Regional Airport to meet with him. Cullen said the project will give communities, First Nations and everyone the kind of information needed to be able to plan for flooding, fires, conservation, old growth protection and resource development. Im just so proud, he said. Initially a flyover of Williams Lake was planned for the minister, but the weather prevented that from happening. Instead, Cullen joined Ksik chief pilot and operations manager Robyn Stewart and acquisitions manager Corey Newton inside one of the planes to see the instruments and learn more about LiDAR. Stewart has been a commercial pilot since 2000. She has done survey flying since 2006 and flown for Ksik since 2011. Newton said they began the project at the end of August and anticipate it will take about four years to complete it. Covering over 950,000 square kilometres the LiDAR project is the biggest of its kind. The only other one that I could find was in France, Newton said. They did about 500,000 square kilometres, but the majority of it is pretty flat and nonmountainous. We got our work cut out for us for sure. Its ambitious. Newton said the project will give everyone a common point of data and from that information communities might decide they want to have further study done of a specific area. Cullen said many communities are telling government, including in the Cariboo, their 200yearflood zone does not feel like a 200year flood zone anymore, that hydrology is changing and flooding is changing and asked if the project will help with that. Responding, Newton said the precision and accuracy combined of LiDAR can give more information than photographs can. After meeting with the crew he said he could feel the pride of the folks working on the project, what it means for B.C. and for the world. Presently, the province makes a large collection of LiDAR data that accounts for 14 per cent of B.C.s landscape free and equally accessible to everyone on the LidarBC website. New LiDAR data sourced from Ksik will significantly update the provinces digital models of landscapes that are based on aerial imagery taken 30 years ago, and will include detailed representations of forests, buildings and other infrastructure, noted a news release from the Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship. The program will initially concentrate on gathering data for rural areas and other areas of the province that are not currently represented in the LidarBC database. In April 2023, the province announced 38 million in support for the new program.

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 201621 included children. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Many are enduring overlapping crises where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said.|Storms, floods, fires and other extreme weather events led to more than 43 million displacements involving children between 2016 and 2021, according to a United Nations report. More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10yearold Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the oncefertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. Thats a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night, Ibrahim said. The miseries of long, drawnout disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report more than half of them in Somalia but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no preemptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in the future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify, said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the reports authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 201621 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically dont differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Genevabased nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring overlapping crises where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10yearold Garima Kumars family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we dont have a permanent home, Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month a process Garimas mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasnt had any work for over a month. The familys only income is the mothers 2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnambased expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasnt involved with the report. When youre desperate, you do things that you normally wouldnt do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they dont have the ability to stand up for themselves, she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become shockresponsive, portable and inclusive, to help children and their families better cope with disasters.

Credit Valley Conservations CVC Greening Corporate Grounds team recently hosted a tree planting event at St. Georges Anglican Church on Guelph Street, where a mini forest of 396 native trees and shrubs were planted a first of its kind project in the Credit River watershed. The location backs onto Silver Creek Conservation Area and the plantings will help create connectivity and a corridor for wildlife, says the CVC. An educational sign will be installed later this year to commemorate the project and inform visitors about the mini forest. There are many benefits of mini forests, said Deborah Kenley, senior coordinator of Greening Corporate Grounds for CVC. Mini forests capture carbon quicker, generate shade which helps to cool our cities, provide food and shelter for wildlife, and reduce flood risk by absorbing rainwater. Popularized by Japanese botanist, Akira Miyawaki, mini forests are small, dense plantings of many different native tree and shrub species. The technique mimics natural forest conditions and encourages faster growth. The forests can reach maturity in as little as 20 years traditional plantations can take 100 to 200 years. A minimum of 100 square metres is needed for the plantings. According to the CVC, establishing new forests or growth tends to be more successful when trees are planted together to form communities. The mini forest method of planting tightly encourages the fast upward growth of trees towards the sun, while shrubs add diversity and supports healthy habitat. This mini forest project was funded through Green Community Canadas Living Cities Fund.|0

Meanwhile, droughts triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children with Somalia again among the most affected, while wildfires triggered 810,000 child displacements, with more than a third occurring in 2020 alone.

Children Displaced in a Changing Climate is the first global analysis of the number of children driven from their homes between 2016 and 2021 due to floods, storms, droughts and wildfires, and looks at projections for the next 30 years. According to the analysis, China and the Philippines are among the countries that recorded the highest absolute numbers of child displacements, due to their exposure to extreme weather, large child populations and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. However, relative to the size of the child population, children living in small island states, such as Dominica and Vanuatu, were most affected by storms, while children in Somalia and South Sudan were most affected by floods. It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community, said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but its also very disruptive. As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climatedriven movement. We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly. We need to strengthen efforts to prepare communities, protect children at risk of displacement, and support those already uprooted. Floods and storms accounted for 40.9 million or 95 per cent of recorded child displacements between 2016 and 2021, due in part to better reporting and more preemptive evacuations. Meanwhile, droughts triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children with Somalia again among the most affected, while wildfires triggered 810,000 child displacements, with more than a third occurring in 2020 alone. Canada, Israel and the United States recorded the most. Decisions to move can be forced and abrupt in the face of disaster, or as the result of preemptive evacuation, where lives may be saved but many children still face the dangers and challenges that come with being uprooted from their homes, often for extended periods. Children are especially at risk of displacement in countries already grappling with overlapping crises, such as conflict and poverty, where local capacities to cope with any additional displacements of children are strained. Haiti, for example already at high risk of disasterrelated child displacement is also plagued by violence and poverty, with limited investment in risk mitigation and preparedness. While in Mozambique, it is the poorest communities, including those in urban areas, that are disproportionately affected by extreme weather. These are the countries where the number of vulnerable children at risk of future displacement is the greatest and coping capacities and financing is limited where risk mitigation, adaptation, preparedness efforts and financing are most urgent. Using a disaster displacement risk model developed by Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, the report projects riverine floods have the potential to displace almost 96 million children over the next 30 years, based on current climate data, while cyclonic winds and storm surges have the potential to displace 10.3 million and 7.2 million children respectively, over the same period. With more frequent and more severe weather events as consequence of changing climate, the actual numbers will almost certainly be higher. UNICEF works with governments in countries most at risk to better prepare for and minimise the risk of displacement, develop and implement childresponsive disaster risk reduction climate change adaptation strategies, and design resilient and portable services to protect and reach children before, during and after disaster strikes, catering solutions to address contextspecific vulnerabilities. As leaders prepare to meet at the COP28 Climate Change Summit in Dubai in November, UNICEF urges governments, donors, development partners, and the private sector to take the following actions to protect children and young people at risk of future displacement and prepare them and their communities PROTECT children and young people from the impacts of climate changeexacerbated disasters and displacement by ensuring that childcritical services including education, health, nutrition, social protection and child protection services are shockresponsive, portable and inclusive, including for those already uprooted from their homes. children and young people from the impacts of climate changeexacerbated disasters and displacement by ensuring that childcritical services including education, health, nutrition, social protection and child protection services are shockresponsive, portable and inclusive, including for those already uprooted from their homes.

PRIORITIZE children and young people including those already uprooted from their homes in disaster and climate action and finance, humanitarian and development policy, and investments to prepare for a future already happening. Notes to Editors Because the definition of the hazards considered in the projections are different to those in the historic analysis it is not possible to directly compare the two. The projections also do not include preemptive evacuations. UNICEF analysed data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre IDMC to determine historical child displacements linked to weatherrelated disasters and projected the estimated risk of child displacement in the future using IDMCs risk model. The work was completed with support from the Patrick J McGovern Foundation.|1

Ces lacs sont forms par le recul des glaciers, un phnomne naturel accentu par les tempratures plus chaudes dues au changement climatique dorigine humaine. Leau provenant de la fonte des glaciers est souvent canalise vers les rivires, mais la glace ou laccumulation de dbris peuvent former un barrage naturel, derrire lequel se forme un lac glaciaire. Si ces barrages naturels sont rompus, de grandes quantits deau peuvent schapper soudainement des lacs, provoquant des inondations dvastatrices. Questce qui cause ces ruptures Les barrages naturels qui retiennent les lacs glaciaires peuvent tre rompus pour diverses raisons, selon Lauren Vargo, experte en glaciers et scientifique au Centre de recherche antarctique en NouvelleZlande. Les causes peuvent tre une avalanche de neige, ou un glissement de terrain provoquant une vague dans le lac, ou un remplissage lexcs du lac ... cause de la pluie ou de la fonte des glaciers, atelle expliqu lAFP. Parfois, le barrage se fragilise progressivement au fil du temps ou est rompu la suite dun vnement tel quun tremblement de terre. Les ruptures sont trs imprvisibles, parce quelles peuvent tre causes par un grand nombre de facteurs diffrents, atelle ajout. Quel est limpact du changement climatique Le changement climatique entrane la disparition des glaciers. La moiti des 215 000 glaciers de la plante devrait fondre dici la fin du sicle, mme si le rchauffement peut tre plafonn 1,5 degr Celsius. Le volume des lacs glaciaires a bondi de 50 en 30 ans, selon une tude de 2020 base sur des donnes satellite. Plus les lacs se forment et plus ils sont grands, plus ils reprsentent un risque pour les populations en aval. Le changement climatique nentrane pas seulement la cration de lacs glaciaires, mais peut galement crer des conditions entranant des ruptures de barrages. Les inondations peuvent tre causes par la fonte des glaciers ou par des fortes prcipitations. Nous savons que cela se produit davantage cause du changement climatique, relve Lauren Vargo. Quelle est la dangerosit de ces crues Le danger spcifique aux crues des lacs glaciaires est li leur imprvisibilit. La probabilit quun lac libre une crue subite est difficile quantifier avec prcision sans tudes dtailles et localises, avertit une tude internationale consacre cette anne au sujet. Ltude, publie dans Nature Communications, indique que 15 millions de personnes vivent moins de 50 kilomtres dun lac glaciaire et moins dun kilomtre dune inondation potentielle due une brche. Le risque le plus lev se rencontre dans les hautes montagnes dAsie, une zone qui couvre partiellement 12 pays dont lInde, le Pakistan, la Chine et le Npal. Cela sexplique en partie par le fait que davantage dhabitants vivent proximit des lacs glaciaires dans la rgion que dans dautres parties du monde, ce qui rend les dlais dalerte encore plus courts. Mais cela reflte galement la vulnrabilit de ces populations, qui peuvent tre plus pauvres et moins prpares faire face larrive soudaine de crues catastrophiques. voir aussi|1

All of them know the political pressures they will come under to condemn and break ties with Israel if Palestinian casualties mount. I had a friend with Fatah intelligence connections check, and they confirmed the Hamas arrests, so I left Gaza.|The biggest surprise in Hamass massive attack on Israel this morning is that it was a surprise. The operation was of unprecedented scale, involving thousands of personnel and pieces of equipment, from hang gliders to bulldozers and rockets. Such an effort demands weeks if not months of preparation, and all of it took place under the nose of an Israeli intelligence service that has a deserved reputation as one of the most effective in the world.How that happened is cause for deep embarrassment in Israels security community and will prompt a painful internal investigation. Israel lost control of military outposts, armored vehicles and settlements, and the conflict is far from over. Dozens of Israeli citizens were killed, others were taken hostage and hundreds were injured.Yet Saturdays assault was also an important reminder concerning Hamas. Its a USdesignated terrorist group but no band of hotheads. It is a wellresourced organization with a paramilitary armed force that is as calculating as it is ruthless. Thats what kept it in control of Gaza since 2007 despite being under constant threat from Israel, as well as from still more radical Salafist and other Islamist groups within Gaza.Only Hamas knows the details of its strategy for Saturdays attack, but the potential fallout is plain to see. A war in Gaza threatens at a stroke to upend the direction of travel in the Middle East. It puts Israel in the invidious position of having to choose between appearing weak a dangerous strategy in the region and inflicting the kind of mass casualties in the crowded Gaza Strip that will enrage Israels entire Palestinian population, forcing tough decisions on Arab leaders in the Gulf and beyond. Already on Saturday there were reports of 160 Palestinian dead and more than 1000 wounded in Israels retaliatory airstrikes. Israel has had success normalizing relations with parts of the Arab world while supporting the expansion of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and, at best, slow walking prospects for Palestinian statehood. Since 2020, Israel has signed USbrokered recognition agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca, has been considering a deal. Even Turkeys Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who for years had positioned himself as champion of the Palestinian cause for domestic political gain, met with Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time last month.Saturdays calls from Erdogan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others for deescalation came quickly and were doubtless genuine. All of them know the political pressures they will come under to condemn and break ties with Israel if Palestinian casualties mount. That now seems inevitable. Netanyahu said his country was at war, while Major General Ghasan Alyan said Hamas had opened the gates of hell to the Gaza strip, in a clip to camera posted on the Israeli Defense Forces feed on X formerly Twitter. Alyan went on to say that Hamas will bear responsibility for the consequences, but no matter how true that may be and it is the question of who fired first on Saturday will count for little in the Muslim world. There, popular outrage over Israeli actions in recent months and years, in particular around the AlAqsa mosque in Jerusalem, had been mounting. Alyans words will resonate less than those of Mohammed Deif, a Hamas military commander, who said that Operation AlAqsa Flood was launched because enough is enough. Already, the Saudi government statement calling for calm on Saturday sought to position Hamass actions as retaliatory, recalling the kingdoms repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.Hamas, which has never acknowledged Israels right to exist, will have predicted and factored all this into its decision to attack. I say this not because I have Deifs cell number, but because I have encountered the groups calculating nature. In 2011, I went to report in Gaza, unwittingly entering from Israel early on the morning that the US killed Osama bin Laden. Later that day, a Hamas official approached to offer a sixman security detail or escort to the border, because they had picked up Salafists who were looking for the American journalist so they could make a video. I had a friend with Fatah intelligence connections check, and they confirmed the Hamas arrests, so I left Gaza. I retell this only because it was clear even from the security official who sat down with me that Hamas had no liking for US journalists, nor any moral issue with hosting an exemplary retaliation for Bin Ladens death. Yet this was May 2011. Hamas was in reconciliation talks with Fatah then, under international scrutiny and the group didnt want the kind of attention a video would draw.Now, they do have a tactical interest in that kind of attention. Events had not been going Hamass way in recent years, and a SaudiIsraeli normalization would have been a major defeat. Hamass aggression will boost its support base, and the appalling videos of Israeli casualties it organized to take on Saturday will help with recruitment. Responding to Hamas while keeping IsraeliArab normalization on track will be extraordinarily difficult for Netanyahu to pull off, and the more so the longer the fighting continues.|1

The resistance in Gaza reports taking dozens of hostages including Brigadier General Nimrod Aloni. The operation, called AlAqsa Flood, was launched on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war in which Egypt reclaimed the occupied Sinai from Zionist occupation, and is set to alter the direction of the struggle in occupied Palestine, moving from resistance toward revolution and liberation, the organization writes. It explains that the resistance operation comes in response to the ongoing stream of crimes against the Palestinian people, the daily murder of Palestinians on the streets of the West Bank of occupied Palestine, the siege on Gaza, the theft of land for settlements, the denial of refugees right to return, imposing exile for over 75 years, the torture and attacks on the Palestinian prisoners, the ongoing invasions of AlAqsa Mosque, and the 75 years of Zionist occupation and over 100 years of imperialist domination and colonialism throughout occupied Palestine. It also comes to bring about the liberation of Palestinian prisoners, as part and parcel of the Palestinian people and land. Samidoun continues It is a decisive rebuke to the entire path of Oslo and normalization imposed upon the Palestinian and Arab people for the past 50 years, indicating a new path forward with a clear goal liberation, and nothing less. It builds upon the liberation of south Lebanon from occupation by the Lebanese resistance, led by Hezbollah, in 2000, and the defeat of the Zionist invasion of Lebanon in 2006, as well as the successive heroic battles waged by the Palestinian resistance throughout occupied Palestine and especially from its base area of resistance land in Gaza. Samidoun joins the Masar Badil, the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement, in calling the masses of our Palestinian people, supporters of the resistance in exile and diaspora, allies from the liberation forces and movements, and solidarity committees with the Palestinian people everywhere, to express their support for the heroic Palestinian resistance, raise the flag of Palestine and the banners of resistance, and organize popular, political and media demonstrations and events to expose the Zionist crimes against our people in occupied Palestine the resistance has announced that it has taken a significant number of prisoners from among the occupation soldiers and settlers in order to liberate the 5,250 Palestinian prisoners in occupation prisons, including the 1,350 jailed without charge or trial under administrative detention, 39 women and 170 children. The Masar Badil, the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement called on its organizations and supporters, the masses of our Palestinian people, supporters of the resistance in exile and diaspora, allies from the liberation forces and movements, and solidarity committees with the Palestinian people everywhere, to express their support for the heroic Palestinian resistance, raise the flag of Palestine and the banners of resistance, and organize popular, political and media demonstrations and events to expose the Zionist crimes against our people in occupied Palestine, and to support the AlAqsa Flood operation announced by the CommanderinChief of the Izz alDin alQassam Brigades the military wing of Hamas, Brother Mohammed alDeif. The heroic Palestinian resistance has opened a chapter of battles of dignity and pride at the dawn of October 7, 2023, and it is now responding to decades of continuous and repeated Zionist, American and European aggression against the masses of our Arab and Islamic nation. Hamas said more than 7,000 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel, declaring it had started Operation AlAqsa Flood. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance movement also said its fighters have joined the operation as Hamas called on Palestinians everywhere to fight and on resistance groups in Lebanon to join the fighting against Israel. Israel responded with massive air strikes deep inside the coastal enclave, killing scores and wounding hundreds of people and vowing unprecedented retaliation.Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. We are in a war and we will win it. Gaza health officials said at least 232 Palestinians had been killed and more than 1,697 injured, and carried into crumbling and overcrowded hospitals with severe shortages of medical supplies and equipment. According to Israeli media, at least 200 Israelis have been killed and over 1,100 injured following the largescale operation. The Israel regime has cut electricity to the Gaza Strip as it intensifies its attacks against the besieged Palestinian territory. The regimes energy minister said he ordered the staterun electricity company to halt power supply to the Gaza Strip on Saturday. I have signed an order instructing Israel Electric Company to stop the electricity supply to Gaza, Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. Power outages have long been an everyday occurrence in Gaza and households only had electricity for several hours a day on a rotational basis on the days before recent power cuts started. Gazas power authority says 80 per cent of the electricity supplies to Gaza from the national grid have been cut off following Israels announcement. The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel, UN Human Rights Commission in its recent report September 2023 concluded that Israel has violated and continues to violate the right of the Palestinian people to selfdetermination by its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. The legal consequence of the violation of right to selfdetermination, which is an obligation erga omnes toward all, is the responsibility of the State of Israel. The current occupation, which has lasted 56 years to date, is unlawful under international law. The result of the unlawful acts entails legal consequences for Israel to bring an end to the internationally wrongful act.40 All States and the UN are also under an obligation to act urgently to bring the unlawful acts to an end.

Residents looking to test their axe throwing abilities can book a spot by emailing email protected, calling 7055750293, or by messaging Soo Axe Throwing on social media.|EDITORS NOTE A version of this article originally appeared on SooToday on Sept. 27. It is being republished here for readers who may have missed it. Brad Collar has been throwing axes since he was a young boy. Reminiscing on his earliest years, the Sault resident has fond memories of spending enjoyable afternoons out in the country throwing fullsized axes into the side of his grandfathers garage. Wed do it on the side of the garage until my grandfather put boards up and he had to fix the siding, Collar chuckled. Wed have a good time. Decades later, the now father of two has reignited his passion for the target striking sport and hes inviting the community to give it a try at his new eastend business. Called Soo Axe Throwing, the new MacDonald Avenue establishment provides locals of all ages with the chance to test their axe throwing skills. Its something physical, something fun, something different, he says. A lot of people havent seen it. Before participants begin throwing, they will sign a waiver, be given a rundown on safety, and then be provided a demonstration on how to throw the axe. Working at Bath Fitter by day, Collar says this is the first time hes opened his own storefront business and sensed there was a demand for this kind of leisure activity in town. I had been to some of the ones in Sudbury and down in Mackinaw, and theres nothing here in the Sault that was like it, he told SooToday. Twenty some years ago we used to have everything here go carts, mini golf it all seems to be leaving. It just made sense to do something here. Celebrating his grand opening last Saturday, Collar has already seen a variety of demographics come through the facility, including higher numbers in women which is nice to see according to the owner. He also hosted a kids birthday party on Sunday and affirmed that axe throwing really is for everyone. Pretty much anyone can do it, he says. Ive had kids in here at eight and nine years old throwing them for birthday parties. They just need a parent or guardian for the insurance waivers. We also have the plastic sets, and there are Velcro ones we can set up too. Four or fiveyearolds can play with them. Everybody thats been coming has been having a good time. Everybody who shows up so far has been coming back too. Axe throwers also have the option of choosing from several different types of axes that meet their specific needs, ranging from one and a half to two and a half pounds in weight. Some are lighter than the other ones, we have some heavier ones, and then there are some really heavy ones, Collar says. Quite a bit of research went into it to find axes that were going to last. There are specific ones that throw better and rotate properly. We also use the end grain style boards so its easier to get the axes in. Its a lot more fun youre not dropping them every time. Starting in December, the axe expert says hell begin offering knife throwing as well. Collar is also planning to build a mobile axe throwing trailer, which he intends to bring to city events like Bon Soo, Canada Day, and Rotaryfest. Residents looking to test their axe throwing abilities can book a spot by emailing email protected, calling 7055750293, or by messaging Soo Axe Throwing on social media.

We are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack, Netanyahu wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The Yom Kippur War was small compared to it, and I was a soldier in the Yom Kippur War. Hamas said Saturday it had fired 5,000 rockets, while Israel reported some 3,000 incoming projectiles. Israel and Hamas have fought several wars since, with the latest in May killing 34 Palestinians and one Israeli.|Almost 1,000 killed in Israel war with Hamas JERUSALEM The death toll surged to almost 1,000 since Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its massive surprise attack on Israel with a barrage of rockets and a largescale ground assault, officials on both sides said Sunday. The conflicts worst escalation in decades has claimed more than 600 lives on the Israeli side, the government press office said, while Gaza officials reported at least 370 deaths, with thousands more wounded on each side. Thousands of Israeli forces were deployed to battle holdout Hamas fighters in the south and the airforce again pounded targets in the Gaza Strip as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of a long and difficult war ahead. Gun battles raged in towns and on highways as the Israeli army sought to secure desert regions near the coastal enclave, rescue Israeli hostages and evacuate all areas near Gaza within 24 hours. Well reach each and every community until we kill every terrorist in Israel, vowed military spokesman Daniel Hagari, a day after hundreds of Hamas fighters launched their shock offensive and surged into Israel using vehicles, boats and even motorised paragliders. There was widespread shock and dismay in Israel after at least 100 citizens were captured by Hamas gunmen and abducted into Gaza, with images circulating on social media of bloodied hostages, and distraught relatives pleading for the state to rescue them. Yifat Zailer, 37, said she was horrified to see online video footage from inside Gaza that showed her female cousin and the womans children, aged nine months and three years. Thats the only confirmation we have, she told AFP by phone, her voicing breaking with emotion, and adding there was no information on her cousins husband and her elderly parents. After the army took control of the kibbutz, they werent at home, she said. We assume they were kidnapped ... We want to know what their condition is, we want them to return safe. Theyre innocent civilians. Israel also came under attack from the north when Lebanons Hezbollah launched guided missiles and artillery shells Sunday in solidarity with the unprecedented Hamas offensive, without causing any casualties. Israel responded with artillery strikes across the UNpatrolled border. We recommend Hezbollah not to come into this, said army spokesman Richard Hecht. If they come, we are ready. Israel was stunned when Hamas launched their multipronged offensive at dawn Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, raining down thousands of rockets as fighters infiltrated towns and kibbutz communities and stormed an outdoor rave party held under the desert sky. Panicked Israeli residents phoned media outlets as they hid out in their homes from militants going door to door and shooting civilians or dragging them away. Two Thai nationals were among those killed, and other Asian nationals, many of whom work as farm labourers in the region, were believed to be among the hostages. A lot of people have been killed, said Hecht, after the military released the names of 26 fallen soldiers. We lost soldiers, lost commanders and lost a lot of civilians. We are completing efforts to retake full control of Israeli territory from Hamas, he added, reporting that the army had struck 426 Hamas targets including Gaza tunnels and buildings. Global concern has mounted, with Western capitals condemning the attack by the Islamist group Hamas, which Washington and Brussels consider a terrorist group. Israels foes have praised the assault, including Iran whose President Ebrahim Raisi spoke Sunday with leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad and voiced his support, according to official media in the Islamic republic. AntiIsrael protests have flared in some other majority Muslim countries, and Germany and France were among nations stepping up security around Jewish temples and schools. In the Egyptian city of Alexandria a police officer opened fire at random on Israeli tourists Sunday, killing two of them and their Egyptian guide before he was arrested. Netanyahu who leads a hardright coalition government but has received pledges of support from political opponents during Israels national emergency has vowed to turn Hamas hideouts to rubble and urged Palestinians there to flee. We are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack, Netanyahu wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The first stage is ending at this time with the destruction of the vast majority of the enemy forces that infiltrated our territory, he added, pledging no respite until victory. US President Joe Biden has voiced rock solid and unwavering support for its key ally Israel and warned against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation. Hamas has labelled its attack Operation AlAqsa Flood and called on resistance fighters in the West Bank and Arab and Islamic nations to join the battle. Its attack came half a century after the outbreak of the 1973 ArabIsraeli war, called the Yom Kippur war in Israel, sparking bitter recriminations on what was widely seen as an enormous intelligence failure. There was a very bad failure here, said Sderot resident Yaakov Shoshani, 70. The Yom Kippur War was small compared to it, and I was a soldier in the Yom Kippur War. He recalled the terror of the attack on their town near Gaza. I held a kitchen knife and a large screwdriver, and I told my wife that, if something happens, to make sure to read the Kaddish prayer over me, if you stay alive, he said. And so we stayed close to each other at home, shut everything and turned off the lights. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh has predicted victory and vowed to press ahead with the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation prisons. Hamas said Saturday it had fired 5,000 rockets, while Israel reported some 3,000 incoming projectiles. Several bypassed the Iron Dome missile defence system and smashed into buildings as far as Tel Aviv. Israel rushed forces to the embattled south, called up reservists and hit Gaza in operation Swords of Iron, with some observers predicting a possible ground invasion of Gaza. Sderot resident Yitzhak, 67, said he expected the army to now conquer Gaza house by house, clean the area there properly, and not leave Gaza until they get the very last rocket out of the ground. Israeli attacks have reduced several Gaza residential towers to rubble in what Israel said were strikes aimed at Hamas facilities and which had followed warning calls for people inside to evacuate. Another strike completely destroyed a mosque in Gazas Khan Yunis. Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, leading to Israels blockade of the impoverished enclave of 2.3 million people. Israel and Hamas have fought several wars since, with the latest in May killing 34 Palestinians and one Israeli. Many Gaza residents voiced defiance, with Mohammed Saq Allah, 23, saying We will not give up, and we are here to stay. This is our land, and we will not abandon our land. The new war follows months of rising violence in the occupied West Bank and tensions around Gazas border and at contested holy sites in Jerusalem. Before Saturday, the conflict had killed at least 247 Palestinians, 32 Israelis and two foreigners, including combatants and civilians, this year, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials. Violence flared again in the West Bank Saturday, leaving at least seven Palestinians dead, said the health ministry in Ramallah. UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres urged all diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration and stressed that only through negotiation leading to a twostate solution can peace be achieved.|1

It wasnt clear what triggered the deadly flood in the mountainous Sikkim state, the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. The design and placement of the 6yearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built. A 2019 report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority identified Lhonak Lake as highly vulnerable to flooding that could breach dams and cause extensive damage to life and property. In February 2021, flash floods killed nearly 200 people and washed away houses in Uttarakhand state in northern India.|GANGTOK, India Rescuers found more bodies overnight as they dug through slushy debris and icecold water in a hunt for survivors after a glacial lake burst through a dam in Indias Himalayan northeast, washing away houses and bridges and forcing thousands to flee. Officials said the hundreds of rescuers recovered six more bodies early Saturday, bringing the death toll to 47. At least 150 people are still missing. The flood began shortly after midnight Wednesday, when the waters of a glacial lake overflowed, cracking open the biggest hydroelectric dam in Sikkim state. The icy waters then cascaded through towns in the valley below, where it killed scores of people and carried some bodies kilometers miles away downstream, where they were found in the neighboring state of West Bengal and Bangladesh, police said. Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in Indias Himalayan region during the JuneSeptember monsoon season. Scientists say they are becoming more frequent as global warming contributes to the melting of glaciers there. Police said nearly 4,000 tourists were stranded in two locations, Lachung and Lachen in the northern part of the state, where access was severely restricted as the floods had washed away roads. But the bad weather has made rescue efforts more challenging, with authorities unable to deploy helicopters to assist those stuck in vulnerable areas. Some 3,900 people were currently in 26 relief camps set up by the state, Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang said on Saturday. Out of the 23 Indian army soldiers who were earlier reported missing, one had been rescued and eight had died, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said, adding that search operations were carrying on. It wasnt clear what triggered the deadly flood in the mountainous Sikkim state, the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state. In July, record rains killed more than 100 people over two weeks in northern India. Experts pointed to intense rain and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon as possible contributors. But the disaster also underscores a climate dilemma that pits local environmental activists who say dams in the Himalayas are too dangerous against authorities pursuing a national green energy agenda. The design and placement of the 6yearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built. A 2019 report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority identified Lhonak Lake as highly vulnerable to flooding that could breach dams and cause extensive damage to life and property. Despite risks to dams due to the increasing frequency of extreme weather, the Indian federal government aims to increase Indias hydroelectric dam output by half, to 70,000 megawatts, by 2030. Prakash Chetri, an employee of the Teesta 3 dam operator, was working at the site when he and others were told that water levels were increasing and they should evacuate. Nearly an hour later, we saw a lot of water the whole dam was filled with water, he said, adding that while he was lucky to escape, 14 others who worked with him were still missing. I was running to save my life ... in those moments, I thought this was the last day of my life, Chetri said. Eleven bridges in the Lachen Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said on Friday. Several towns, including Dikchu and Rangpo in the Teesta basin, were flooded, and schools in four districts were ordered shut until Sunday, the states education department said. The floods also hit several army camps, burying vehicles in feet of mud, according to images released by the Indian military. Himalayan glaciers could lose 80 per cent of their volume if global warming isnt controlled, according to a report from the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. In February 2021, flash floods killed nearly 200 people and washed away houses in Uttarakhand state in northern India. Hussain reported from Gauhati, India.|1

Les mtorologues estiment quil est peu probable que la tempte posttropicale Philippe frappe les Maritimes ce weekend avec les mmes vents violents provoqus par la tempte posttropicale Lee le mois dernier. Mais cest peu de rconfort pour Pam Lovelace, la reprsentante municipale dune rgion rurale louest du centreville dHalifax, qui comprend le clbre phare de Peggys Cove. Le district de Mme Lovelace comprend la rgion de Tantallon et Hammonds Plains, o des incendies de fort ont dtruit plus de 150 maisons plus tt cette anne. La rgion a galement t frappe par des inondations historiques en juillet, aprs que de violents orages ont dvers plus de 200 millimtres sur certaines parties de la province, dtruisant des routes, endommageant des maisons et faisant quatre victimes. Il y a absolument un effet cumul de toutes ces catastrophes, a affirm Mme Lovelace samedi. Les arbres et les branches sont vulnrables, les gens sont vulnrables, et cest encore une fois une tempte de plus qui arrive et qui pourrait potentiellement couper llectricit pendant des jours. Environnement Canada a publi des dclarations de cyclones tropicaux pour la cte sudouest de la Nouvellecosse, avertissant que les prcipitations totales pouvaient atteindre 60 millimtres et les rafales de vent pouvaient atteindre 90 kmh. Certaines parties du centre du NouveauBrunswick, notamment Fredericton, SaintJean et Edmundson, pourraient galement tre inondes par 60 millimtres de pluie, a indiqu lagence fdrale. titre de comparaison, la tempte posttropicale Lee a provoqu des vents denviron 110 kmh lorsquelle a touch terre sur Long Island, en Nouvellecosse, il y a trois semaines. Le mtorologue principal au Centre canadien de prvision des ouragans, Chris Fogarty, a averti que Philippe pouvait encore faire tomber des branches sur les lignes lectriques et couper llectricit certaines personnes, mais il a not que ce nest pas rare en Nouvellecosse, mme lors des temptes plus faibles. Selon M. Fogarty, la tempte Philippe nest certainement pas de lintensit de Lee. Philippe affectera les mmes zones le long de la cte atlantique de la Nouvellecosse qui ont subi le plus gros prjudice de Lee, atil ajout. Les vents et les pluies devraient sintensifier samedi soir, avec un pic vers minuit, a indiqu M. Fogarty. On craignait que la tempte ne frappe mare haute, mais il semblait plus probable que ses pires impacts se produiraient prs de la mare basse, ce qui rduit la menace dinondation ctire. Lee a inond les routes du district de Mme Lovelace, ce qui a fait tomber des arbres et des lignes lectriques. Les arbres brls en noir lors des feux de fort du dbut de lanne sont plus facilement renverss par des vents plus faibles, a expliqu le mtorologue. Les accotements routiers, les ponceaux et les systmes de drainage sont encore endommags par Lee, par les inondations de juillet et mme par la tempte posttropicale Fiona de lanne dernire. Une route reliant le phare de Peggys Cove au centreville dHalifax est dailleurs toujours maintenue en un seul tronon par un pont temporaire une voie aprs avoir t emporte par les inondations. Tout cela signifie que Philippe ou des temptes similaires pourrait avoir plus de facilit causer encore plus de destructions, a dclar Mme Lovelace. Elle a soulign que la municipalit rgionale dHalifax tait toujours confronte des cots de rparation de plus de 20 millions la suite de ces catastrophes, y compris celle de Fiona, selon un rapport remis en septembre son comit des finances. Certains habitants du quartier de Mme Lovelace taient inquiets lapproche de Philippe, surtout par rapport aux pannes de courant. Dautres se sentaient mieux prpars parce quils ont russi rsister par le pass et savent comment se prparer. Nous sommes fatigus et puiss par tous ces dsastres, atelle dclar. Avec le long weekend, lespoir tait de se retrouver en famille et de profiter de la famille, mais pour certaines personnes, cela ne sera peuttre pas possible. M. Fogarty a soulign que la saison des ouragans de cette anne a dj connu plus de temptes nommes quune anne normale, et quelle ne sera pas termine avant un mois et demi. La Presse Canadienne|1

The elected representative is held responsible for everything has more dash but less power to get things done than the bureaucrat in any State department. Rev Ronald G. Thwaites is an attorneyatlaw.|Last week, National Integrity Action hosted a presentation on the findings and recommendations of their recent study of how effectively the Jamaican Legislature exercises oversight over the Executive. Then there were reports of the committee at Gordon House thrashing around to develop a job description for members of parliament. Listening set off a flood of memories. WANTED A SOCIAL SECURITY NET Like about Doris, a stomach cancer sufferer on Hanover St. who called her MP after midnight to beg for money to buy the pain killer which the DrugServ pharmacy did not stock. Arriving with the cash, the groans of her deaththroes breached the night silence. Then there was the issue of affording the funeral. And after that, how would the three grandchildren she had been caring, be maintained Where was the money for all those things to come from in time, or at all During my fourterm tenure there were hundreds of other such instances where the elected representative was the only person to whom desperate people could turn. And, ashamed to admit, there were scores of other occasions of genuine need when, exhausted of funds and emotional energy, I did not respond. Talk about living in ones constituency What do you do when the school children line up at your office gate, mouthcorners white and dry, seeking a breakfast money before classes Which government agency do you send them to Or the elderly and indigent Tell them to eat cake Or apply to PATH, go to Father Ho Lung or Mother Teresa EMPTY PROMISES Then there were the tours and meetings arranged with ministers to wheedle for some improvement repairing a road, fixing a school, quelling a violent outbreak, encouraging small business, acquiring indigent houses or, most often of all, relieving fire victims. Most to no avail despite best intentions and palpable need. Food for the Poor proved quicker responder. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. Was all this the intended job of a member of parliament in our distorted version of the Westminster model Interfacing with the public bureaucracy to get things done involves begging favours, explaining six times, waiting and .... waiting. And you better believe that kisses go by favour. If you are in Opposition, you and your people are salt. BY DEFAULT Thank God for Bruce Golding who instituted the muchmaligned Constituency Development Fund. But that has its own limits and bureaucracy. When the likes of Doris needed immediate relief, you used your own money until there was none left. The default position is to get hard of heart to be missing in action limiting the time of exposure to the very people you want to be with or to suck up to some boops who will finance constituency needs at a price. Now, with the much bigger money MPs get, ask any of them it only means the requests and demands are greater and more insistent. Jamaica has no social security system equal to the needs of the increasing number of poor. The elected representative is held responsible for everything has more dash but less power to get things done than the bureaucrat in any State department. Ask any of them about the road rehabilitation programme which has been promised months ago, thereby raising immediate expectations among constituents, but is yet to be implemented. And you cant complain too loudly either because, if you are a government member, you will be considered disloyal and subtly victimised, while if your party is in Opposition, you are presumed to be more presumptions and impertinent than Oliver Twist. MAKING GOOD LAWS Then come to Gordon House on Tuesday afternoon and participate in the exercise of passing just laws for the public weal. The agenda is entirely determined by the House Leader and the capacity to intervene meaningfully is subject to a usually partisan Speaker who takes her cue from the said House Leader. Oh for a Speaker like the independentminded and supercalm Michael Peart During my time, I asked scores of questions and introduced many more private members motions than anyone else mostly to no avail. It makes me wince when I hear one of these latterday Speakers proclaim their fidelity to the standing orders which are breached flagrantly by them at every sitting. My questions and motions were never rejected for irrelevance though Pearnel sometimes tried to edit them to make the government not look so bad, but most fell off the order paper at the end of a term, never given a chance to be debated. My zeal was considered a nuisance. Most other members never bothered to try. The standing orders provide for a Thursday sitting to accommodate private members business. But when has that ever been implemented and which quorum is going to turn up on that day of the week anyway THE NIA REVIEW No wonder Jeanette Calder at JAMP could record 294 reports tabled by state agencies spending tens of billions of the dollars extracted from persons like Doris, but never examined except in one deggedegge committee meeting over the period. This is bald truth which should outrage everyone. There is no effective oversight of public expenditure by the legislature. No wonder people make it a virtue to evade taxes. In fact both Trevor Munroe and JAMP were much too mild in their critique of parliamentary oversight. I fought for the reestablishment of the Public Administration Appropriations Committee at the turn of the century. This has proved such an embarrassment to a slack government that it is proposed that this Committee should be restricted to consider only to those matters referred to it by the whole House. The Public Accounts Committee only works in arrears and only when provoked by some auditorgenerals report. And, after all the publicity, what becomes of their recommendations The Standing Finance Committee is scandalously useless. Any searching questions of budget items are routinely shouted down. Members show little or no interest in interrogating the efficiency of the trillion and more dollars presented in the big yellow book by the Finance Ministry. So NIA and JAMP may have reason to balance their inventory of deficiencies with their acknowledgement of slight successes. It could be even worse. Their effort is highly commendable. Without their kind of oversight, arrogance, recklessness and corruption would prevail unchecked. WEAK COMMITTEE STRUCTURE Then there were the interminable hours spent in sessional committees. Meetings are irregular because facilities and staff are said to be limited. This government has neutered committees into near extinction by their fear of Opposition chairpersons. The public and interest groups are heard, reports are written, most of which never influence policy or legislation. A cruel example is my fruitless effort over two decades to require the names of all fathers to be recorded on their childrens birth certificates. IS IT WORTH IT Each candidate in the upcoming elections must ask themselves if the effort at representation is worth it. Those who conclude that it is must resolve to radically change the capacities and accountability of the present order. Our governance arrangements are broken full of form and too empty of substance. Autocracy thrives. The present system produces elected eunuchs. Rev Ronald G. Thwaites is an attorneyatlaw. He is former member of parliament for Kingston Central and was the minister of education.

Green infrastructure is amazing because it can be transformative in so many different ways, she said.|Open this photo in gallery Place de Fleurs de Macadam on Oct. 4, in Montreal.Ryan RemiorzThe Canadian Press From green roofs in Toronto to Vancouvers rain city strategy, Canadian cities are looking to become sponges in order to help mitigate some of the effects of extreme rainfall events. In Montreal, Mayor Valrie Plante announced last week that the city plans to develop some 30 additional sponge parks designed to catch and absorb rainwater and keep it from flowing into overburdened sewers during extreme rain events. Those, combined with an additional 400 sponge sidewalks, featuring added vegetation squares, will help the city retain the equivalent of three Olympic swimming pools in water at half the cost of underground works, the city said in a news release. Melanie Glorieux, a sustainable landscape planner with the firm Rousseau Lefebvre, said that while the concept of building a sponge city isnt new, its an idea that more and more municipalities are embracing as they cope with extreme weather. The idea, she said, is to divert stormwater into low areas or channels planted with trees, shrubs and grasses, so that more of it is absorbed on the surface and less flows into sewers, lakes or rivers. As an added benefit, the plants filter the water before it enters the system, removing some of the pollutants it picks up from the streets. Firstly, we reduce the quantity of water sent to sewers, and secondly, we improve the quality of what is there, she said. The goal is to reverse some of the harm done by the last 40 to 50 years of caroriented urban development, which involved replacing natural spaces that soak up water with impermeable infrastructure such as roads and parking lots. In place of absorption, water was redirected to underground sewer systems, which can become overwhelmed by heavy rain, causing flooding and contamination of rivers. The spongecity concept, which first rose to prominence in China, is essentially the opposite Limit runoff and maximize infiltration, Ms. Glorieux said. Green infrastructure can be incorporated into a landscape in many ways, from simple tree planting to rain gardens, swales, holding ponds and more complex bioretention systems that involve layers of filtering, she said. Some projects are also replacing asphalt with permeable paving that allows better water flow. Ms. Glorieux said most of the green infrastructure water retention areas are designed to absorb the first 25 millimetres of rainfall, which means they should be able to handle about 95 per cent of rain events. Emily Amon, the director of green infrastructure at Green Communities Canada, says the combination of increasingly severe weather events due to climate change and urbanization has led to real losses on the landscape in terms of our ability to absorb that stormwater we receive. On July 13, Montreal received a months worth of rain in less than two hours, causing some 85 millimetres of rain to flood underpasses, overflow from sewers and force city officials to warn citizens to stay away from waterways due to possible contamination. The nonprofit Green Communities Canada works with other organizations to help municipalities create green infrastructure, including planting mini forests and gardens that absorb rain and removing the pavement from old parking lots. Across Canada, cities appear to be jumping on board. Toronto has won praise for its bylaw requiring new developments greater than 2,000 square metres to have green roofs over part of their surfaces. The roofs soak up rainwater that otherwise would run off into sewers. Vancouver, Ms. Amon said, has implemented a rain city strategy that aims to integrate green infrastructure throughout planning decisions. She said the Federation of Canadian Municipalities has started a natural asset management program that encourages cities to categorize and put a dollar value on their green infrastructure so it can be better managed a strategy that was pioneered in Gibsons, B.C. Guillaume Grgoire, an assistant professor who studies plant sciences and green infrastructure at Laval University in Quebec City, says green infrastructure does not really have any downside, but it has to occupy a good part of the territory in order to have a true effect. He says green infrastructure can be expensive to install and need a bit more maintenance than a simple sewer pipe, which has made some municipalities more hesitant. However, he said comparative studies have shown that the cost over time is the same or less than that of upgrading sewer systems, even when the extra maintenance is taken into account. All three experts say that in addition to stormwater management, the sponge city model brings other benefits, including increased biodiversity, reduced heat island effect, attractive public spaces and more exposure to nature, which contributes to better mental health. Ms. Amon adds that green infrastructure can also contribute to more equitable neighbourhoods by adding foodbearing trees, culturally significant plants and more greenery to neighbourhoods that lack it. Green infrastructure is amazing because it can be transformative in so many different ways, she said.|1

North Cowichan Mayor Rob Douglas report included the following updates Earlier this month, Chief James Thomas from the Halalt Nation invited Councillor Debra Toporowski and I to join a meeting with the Minister of Emergency Management Climate Change Readiness, Bowinn Ma, to discuss the need for provincial funding for additional flood mitigation works along the Chemainus River, including to stabilize the right bank downstream from the TransCanada Highway bridge. Shortly after this meeting, work began to remove about 8,500 cubic metres of sediment from a gravel bar between the Chemainus Road Bridge and the E N railway bridge on the Chemainus River. The work is being funded by the Province and managed by their consultant, KWL, with North Cowichan providing inkind assistance in liaising with nearby residents, documentation reviews and related support to the project. Halalt Nation is an integral part of the project, supporting the work and facilitating the contract with local company Stone Pacific. Sharing of the gravel was agreed upon with the affected landowners, who are donating about half of the material for municipal use and half to the Halalt Nation. In September, North Cowichan council joined more than 2,000 elected officials from communities across the province for the annual Union of BC Municipalities convention in Vancouver. Council met with Premier David Eby, Minister of Forests Bruce Ralston, Minister of Mental Health Addictions Jennifer Whiteside and Minister of Tourism, Arts Culture Lana Popham, to discuss the growing challenges we are facing in the municipality including housing, homelessness, climate change and infrastructure and the need for more support from the senior levels of government to tackle these issues. Paper Excellence informed me that more than 300 workers from the Crofton mill will be back on the job in the first week of October and the kraft pulp operations will restart in midOctober. After the threemonth shutdown, this is great news for the workers and their families, for our municipality and for the broader Cowichan region. However, curtailment of the paper operations has been extended to late October, affecting more than 100 workers. Paul Fletcher of the Somenos Marsh Wildlife Society presented on its Firehouse Creek and Samunu wetland proposal. The proposal outlined plans to restore Bings Creek upstream and downstream of the RCMP station on Canada Avenue and restore Firehouse Creek, which currently exists as a ditch located near the North Cowichan and Duncan fire halls between Duncan Street and Canada Avenue. These habitat restoration projects would not only benefit fish populations but would also help stormwater management and provide a place for public interaction with the aquatic environment. Two organizations which had applied for Permissive Tax Exemptions presented to council. Corina Finlay, on behalf of House of Grace Pregnancy Centre, and Scott Bayley, on behalf of Camp Qwanoes, each provided an overview of their organizations in response to councils decision at the Sept. 12 Committee of the Whole meeting to deny their requests for a permissive tax exemption. Council then gave first three readings to the Permissive Tax Exemption Bylaw which exempts certain properties in 2024 from municipal property taxes. The list of properties includes Camp Qwanoes, in addition to the other properties endorsed on Sept. 12. Council will be reviewing its Permissive Tax Exemption Policy over the next 12 months in advance of the 2025 budget. The Sewer Services User Fee Amendment Bylaw was adopted. This bylaw amendment ensures consistency with user fee practices and compliance with provincial legislation and is necessary now that North Cowichan issues separate bills for utility charges. An amendment to the Official Community Plan and zoning bylaws to facilitate a proposed fivelot subdivision at 6409 Wicks Rd. was denied. Council directed staff to align the Building Bylaw to reflect provincial Energy Step Code requirements for space and water heating in buildings. As of May 1, 2023, the Province requires all new residential and commercial buildings to demonstrate compliance with the BC Energy Step Code. North Cowichan will consider adopting Zero Emission Step Code EL3, once the Building Bylaw is amended in October, with EL4 effective July 1, 2024. This would mean that newly constructed buildings are energyefficient and use lowcarbon energy sources. North Cowichan will be engaging with the building industry on these changes. A Temporary Use Permit for 68236833 Bell McKinnon Rd. was approved. The permit will allow construction worker vehicle parking, trades trailers and storage of topsoil adjacent to the new hospital construction site. A Remedial Action Order to rectify hazardous conditions at 7900 Mays Rd. was imposed. A number of issues related to an exposed embankment have been noted. Council approved a request to apply for the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund Grant under the Volunteer Composite Fire Department Training Equipment funding stream for Wildland Personal Protective Equipment in the amount of 30,000. Prebudget approval for regional recreation budgets was approved. The 20242028 budget for the Cowichan Aquatic Centre and Fuller Lake Arena will be submitted to the Cowichan Valley Regional District. Council directed staff to investigate various aspects of installing solar power on civic buildings and homes and bring back a report to the Environmental Advisory Committee for review. Two items were heard at a public hearing An application to permit a detached accessory dwelling unit ADU at 6344 Woodgrove Way received third reading. A twolot subdivision at 3211 Malcolm Rd. received third reading and was adopted. The next council meeting will take place on Wednesday, Oct. 4 at 5 p.m.|1

According to the Associated Press, at least 600 people have been killed in Israel a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades and more than 300 have been killed in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes pound the territory. Dozens of civilians and soldiers from Israel were seized by Hamas fighters and taken back to Gaza. Many of the captives included women, children, and the elderly. Jeff Arbus, a Jewish man in Sault Ste. Marie who has served in numerous leadership roles within the local Beth Jacob Synagogue, calls the attack a blatant act of terrorism. This is a terrorist organization whose key aim is to get rid of Israel, he told SooToday. Thats stated clearly in their charter and in all their documents. What we saw yesterday was a complete act of terrorism theres no other way to describe it. Any attempt to justify the actions of this terrorist organization is in fact supporting terrorism. To me, its not complex. What happened yesterday is very clearcut. While Arbus and his wife dont have immediate family living in Israel, they work with people who do. Someone I work with provincially has a cousin who was murdered, he says. I know there are people in the Sault with connections to Israelis by family or by business or whatever it may be. Theres a huge concern because civilians are being targeted. Sault Ste. Marie has had a Jewish community for 140 years. For more than half that time, Congregation Beth Jacob has remained the first and only synagogue in the twin Saults. Earlier this year, Arbus led an antisemitism training course for some of the citys top officials, including Mayor Matthew Shoemaker, chief administrative officer Malcolm White, and Police Chief Hugh Stevenson. He has reached out to those same officials in the last day and a half to ensure the Saults Jewish community which is estimated to only be in the double digits remains protected in troubling times like this. The trend has been that when incidents like this occur, there is a global spike in antisemitic incidents, he says. We have been in touch with the mayors office and with the local police chief who have been very supportive. Were believing that there is no immediate threat to the local Jewish community, but were certainly being watchful. You lose sleep over stuff like that. While he didnt want to dive too deep into the complexities of the politics overseas, Arbus says he would be in favour of a twostate solution and believes most of the Jewish community would support that as well. If people want to support Palestinian liberation and a Palestinian state Ill join them, he says. But if they want to somehow excuse acts of terrorism as part of that struggle, they dont get my support at all. What happened yesterday is markedly different than what weve seen in the past, both in terms of its scope and the brutality of what happened. They killed civilians, posted videos parading over dead bodies, and desecrated those bodies. Regardless of how people may feel about Palestine or Palestinian liberation, yesterday was a blatant act of horrific terrorism. Politicians across the country, including Shoemaker, Premier Doug Ford, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, took to social media to condemn Hamas attacks. Arbus believes Canadas role in the conflict has some of its own complexities involved, but hes hopeful the country will help provide some muchneeded relief and advocacy for Israel. I think Canadas efforts at the United Nations could be stepped up towards a twostate solution, he admits. Hamas gets its arms from Iran, and Canada is in the middle of a deal with Iran regarding nuclear power. At some point, the rubber hits the road and youve got to make a decision. Theres work for Canada to do, but I think Canada has shown in the past their leadership in the Middle East. I hope they step up and that this all passes soon. We have to be hopeful, and we have to stand up to terrorism.|1

Multiple rivers burst their banks Sunday morning in the Charlevoix region, while other watercourse levels in the area swelled significantly. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, 135 millimetres of rain has fallen in BaieSaintPaul, Que., about 95 kilometres northeast of Quebec City so far this weekend. An additional 10 to 25 millimetres are expected by Sunday evening. One campsite in the area, the Genvrier, was flooded for the fourth time this year by the Rivire des Mares a tributary of the Rivire du Gouffre. Campers were forced to evacuate the premises as a preventative measure. While the Rivire du Gouffre reported major flooding Sunday morning, officials say water levels in the area should start to drop around 4 p.m. Philippe LHeureuxRadioCanada A flood protection wall was installed Sunday afternoon in a residential area to shield several houses from the rising water. On Sunday morning, the Rivire du Gouffre in SaintUrbain, north of BaieSaintPaul, reported major flooding. A chalet was swept away by the waters, officials say. The situation is reminiscent of this past summer, when heavy rains swelled rivers in the region and two volunteer firefighters died after being swept away by rushing floodwaters. In SaintSimon, further northeast in the region, an accommodation centre was opened as a precaution for residents in case the situation deteriorates, according to Mayor Sylvain Tremblay. No one has utilized it as of Sunday afternoon. Officials say water levels in the Charlevoix region should start to drop around 4 p.m. Route 170 is inaccessible from LAnseSaintJean to Sagard between kilometres 13 and 68 due to the flooding. Alexandra DuchaineRadioCanada In BasSaguenay, in the SaguenayLacSaintJean region, Route 170 is inaccessible from LAnseSaintJean to Sagard between kilometres 13 and 68 due to flooding. Homes located between kilometres 56 and 68 are being evacuated. According to the mayor of PetitSaguenay, Philme La France, emergency measures have been triggered. Route 170 is currently cut between PetitSaguenay and LAnseSaintJean, as well as between PetitSaguenay and SaintSimon. It is impossible to evacuate from one side or the other at the moment, the municipality said in a Facebook post Sunday morning. The bridge to get to the PetitSaguenay wharf is currently inaccessible and all chalet residents have been evacuated. EugneMorin Street, Chemin des les and du Quai Street are also closed. We ask you to stay at home unless your residence is threatened by rising waters, the post reads. Sinkhole in Mauricie region splits road The downpour also caused damage in the Mauricie region. In the municipality of SaintMathieuduParc, Chemin des Marcottes was split by a major sinkhole following the heavy rain. According to city officials, it could be several days before the path is fully reopened to residents in the area. A road in SaintMathieuduParc, Que., in the Mauricie region was completely split in two by a sinkhole following the heavy rain.

Violent torrents struck Sikkim state on Wednesday after a highaltitude glacial lake suddenly burst. Scientists warn that similar disasters will become an increasing danger across the Himalayas as global temperatures rise and ice melts, spurred by climate change. A total of 29 bodies have been retrieved from different parts of Sikkim, state relief commissioner Anilraj Rai told AFP by phone. In neighbouring West Bengal state, Jalpaiguri district police told AFP that another 48 bodies had been recovered. More than 100 people are still missing, according to official figures. Water levels along the Teesta river returned to normal four days after the floods hit, an official from Sikkims state disaster control room told AFP. The office said more than 2,500 people stranded in the floods had been rescued. But evacuations have been complicated by the destruction of roads, bridges and telephone lines across much of Sikkim. Another 3,000 people were still stranded in several relief camps in the states north with airlift rescues delayed by bad weather, the office said. More than 1,200 houses were damaged by the floods, according to the state government. Loose ordnance Among the dead were eight Indian army soldiers posted to Sikkim, which sits on Indias remote frontiers with Nepal and China and boasts a sizeable military presence. Indias defense ministry said in a Saturday statement that the floods had washed away firearms and explosives from military camps. Local media reports on Friday said that two people had been killed and four others injured by a mortar shell that exploded while flowing through the flood waters in West Bengal. The water surge came after intense rainfall burst the highaltitude Lhonak Lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the worlds thirdhighest mountain, Kangchenjunga. Water powered downstream, adding to a river already swollen by monsoon rains, damaging a dam and sweeping away houses. Himalayan glaciers are melting faster than ever due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ICIMOD research group. The root cause is climate change, ICIMODs Arun Bhakta Shrestha told AFP on Thursday. Similar glacial lake outbursts flood events are very likely. Earths average surface temperature has risen nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times but highmountain regions around the world have warmed at twice that pace, climate scientists say.|1

Beds were set up outside the main hospital in Herat to receive a flood of victims, photos on social media showed. The Islamist government has ordered most Afghan female aid staff not to work, although with exemptions in health and education. It was not immediately clear if the Herat hospital was on that list. While search and rescue operations remain ongoing, casualties in these areas have not yet been fully identified, it said.|KABUL More than 2,400 people were killed in earthquakes in Afghanistan, the Taliban administration said on Sunday, in the deadliest tremors to rock the quakeprone mountainous country in years. The Saturday quakes in the west of the country hit 35 km 20 miles northwest of the city of Herat, with one of 6.3 magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey USGS said. They were among the worlds deadliest quakes this year, after tremors in Turkey and Syria killed an estimated 50,000 in February. Janan Sayeeq, spokesman for the Ministry of Disasters, said in a message to Reuters that the toll had risen to 2,445 dead, but he revised down the number of injured to more than 2,000. Earlier, he had said that 9,240 people had been injured. Sayeeq also said 1,320 houses had been damaged or destroyed. The death toll spiked from 500 reported earlier on Sunday by the Red Crescent. Ten rescue teams were in the area, which borders Iran, Sayeeq told a press conference. More than 200 dead had been brought to various hospitals, said a Herat health department official who identified himself as Dr Danish, adding most of them were women and children. Bodies had been taken to several places military bases, hospitals, Danish said. Beds were set up outside the main hospital in Herat to receive a flood of victims, photos on social media showed. Food, drinking water, medicine, clothes and tents were urgently needed for rescue and relief, Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban political office in Qatar, said in a message to the media. The mediaeval minarets of Herat sustained some damage, photographs on social media showed, with cracks visible and tiles fallen off. Hemmed in by mountains, Afghanistan has a history of strong earthquakes, many in the rugged Hindu Kush region bordering Pakistan. Death tolls often rise when information comes in from more remote parts of a country where decades of war have left infrastructure in a shambles, and relief and rescue operations difficult to organise. Afghanistans healthcare system, reliant almost entirely on foreign aid, has faced crippling cuts in the two years since the Taliban took over and much international assistance, which had formed the backbone of the economy, was halted. Diplomats and aid officials say concerns over Taliban restrictions on women and competing global humanitarian crises are causing donors to pull back on financial support. The Islamist government has ordered most Afghan female aid staff not to work, although with exemptions in health and education. In August, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was likely to end its financial support for 25 Afghan hospitals because of funding constraints. It was not immediately clear if the Herat hospital was on that list. The quakes triggered panic in Herat, resident Naseema said. People left their houses, we all are on the streets, she wrote in a text message to Reuters on Saturday, adding that the city was feeling aftershocks. There are a total of 202 public health facilities in Herat province, one of which is the major regional hospital where 500 casualties had been taken, the World Health Organization WHOsaid in a report on Sunday. A vast majority of the facilities are smaller basic health centres and logistical challenges were hindering operations, particularly in remote areas, the WHO said. While search and rescue operations remain ongoing, casualties in these areas have not yet been fully identified, it said.

The Storm had been the final team in the Ontario Hockey League without a regulation loss in 202324. Now every team has at least one. The Knights Philadelphia connection got the scoring started in the first period as Oliver Bonks wrist shot from the right point was deflected in by Barkey at the 714 mark for his first goal of the season. Barkey was a thirdround pick of Philadelphias in 2023 and Bonk was the Flyers firstround pick. The game went through a delay in the first intermission when a jammed door prevented the ice resurfacing machines from getting out to flood the ice. A whole lot of ingenuity helped get the machines around to a different door and onto the ice to get the ice ready for the second period. The wait did nothing to dampen the London momentum. The Knights came out and played physically to begin the second period. Will Nicholl carried the puck into the Guelph end just past the sixminute mark of the second period on a 3on1 and slid a pass to Jacob Julien on the right side. Julien onetouched a pass to Jackson Edward and he buried his first of the year to give London a 20 advantage. Charlie Paquette scored for the Storm at 921 to cut Londons lead in half but Barkey set up Ruslan Gazizov for his first goal of 202324 and the Knights led 31 going into the final 20 minutes. Barkeys second of the game into an empty net sealed things for London with 49 seconds left in regulation time. The Knights outshot Guelph 3016. Michael Simpson earned his third victory of the season for London. Brayden Gillespie stopped 26 shots in net for the Storm. Linesperson Kevin Hastings honoured in his final OHL game. Jim Van Horne 980 CFPL Linesperson Kevin Hastings officiated his 1,038th game and his final game in the OHL. Hastings was honoured before the opening faceoff.

Piccinich headed to Norway to play for Stjernan. Piccinich had won a Memorial Cup with the Knights, a Kelly Cup with the Newfoundland Growlers and in his first season playing in the Eliteserien, Piccinich won a scoring title with 65 points in 45 games. In fact, he and his teammates Alex Dostie and Austin Cangelosi were 123 in league scoring. Through six games Piccinich is doing the same kind of offensive damage with 12 points to sit second in scoring in the Eliteserien. Dostie is no longer playing for Stjernan but Cangelosi is right there with Piccinich tied in points so far as the duo looks for a repeat atop the scoring race. Up next The London Knights and the Peterborough Petes will meet on Thursday, Oct. 12 in Peterborough for the first time since last years OHL Championship series.

Once an IWMbased watershed management plan is in place, our role will likely diminish.|Geoff Ross with Muskoka Watershed Council was before Huntsvilles General Committee last month, asking for financial support and participation in the formation of an Integrated Watershed Management Plan, which would encompass a coordinated approach toward managing the watershed across 13 municipalities. The plan would involve integrating multidisciplinary goals for planning, infrastructure, climate action, flood management, and other challenges of the 21st Century, according to his presentation. There are a number of seriously concerning trends were seeing in our watershed today and the current forms of management or land use planning are simply not up to dealing with these trends. This comes largely from climate change and climate change is giving us a world which is quite different from the world we have experienced in the past, said Ross, who told council he had previously worked for the Ministry of the Environment and learned from experience the importance of dealing with negative environmental trends as they are discovered rather than being reactive. He said the Muskoka Watershed Council MWC has been actively promoting integrated watershed management as the most promising response to deal with the problems were facing. Were not alone in doing this. The Muskoka Watershed Advisory Group appointed by the Province of Ontario, largely as a result of the 2019 flood, recommended Integrated Watershed Management. Its referred to in the Provincial Policy Statement and many jurisdictions across Canada and the world are using Integrated Watershed Management IWM but not as yet in Muskoka. He told councillors its a project needed to preserve Muskokas ecosystem which is the basis for Muskokas economy. He said MWC, made up of volunteers, is in a unique position to partner with municipalities in getting an Integrated Watershed Management Plan in place. Once an IWMbased watershed management plan is in place, our role will likely diminish. We are a community of volunteers speaking to science, he said, adding that MWC would not be the administrator of the plan. Who would administer the plan would be determined as the plan is formalized. Deputy Mayor Dan Armour questioned whether it would be better to ask for funding from the District of Muskoka since it is a districtwide initiative. Ross said they want all municipalities to be involved and they need all municipalities to pitch in. A request for 15,000 was made. Councillor Scott Morrison suggested that the funds could come from the Towns portion of the Huntsville Municipal Accommodation Tax so the burden does not fall on the taxpayer, noting that he supports the initiative and that without the natural environment, there is no tourism. I could justify that money coming out of the MAT tax because it does affect tourism. If our lakes are full of bluegreen algae no one is going to come to visit. Staff told the committee to include it in the 2024 draft budget first and then see if it would qualify under the accommodation tax. Councillor Helena Renwick said she also supports the initiative, which she referred to as imperative. If we dont have clean lakes, were not going to get people here anymore, so I would highly support that. Armour said that while he does not disagree with the initiative, hed hate to be the only municipality to fund it. Huntsville Mayor Nancy Alcock said she understood the concern but said she did know that Lake of Bay and Bracebridge are incredibly supportive and District. Councillor Cory Clarke also questioned why MWC wouldnt go to the District first but said he agreed with the importance of the lakes and supports the project, although hed rather see the money come from the accommodation tax. I think we need to lead by example here, said Councillor Jason FitzGerald. Councillor Bob Stone said he agrees that the natural environment is the areas economy and needs to be protected. Im just thinking that theres no definite use for this money yet. Its just hey lets make a pot of money and then well decide how to disseminate it, so Im not all in. He also noted that the MAT money isnt just a giant pot of money. We want to use some of that for housing and many other great projects too so its not just an endless pot that we can keep taking from. Councillor Dione Schumacher said shed be in favour of supporting the project at 15,000 this year if it comes from the accommodation tax and at 10,000 initially suggested by the Mayor to get approval around the table if it comes from the property tax. I dont want to necessarily dip in too much, as Councillor Stone said we dont exactly know where its going but I do know it has touched our community and my little lake of Longs Lake in Utterson has bluegreen algae so it is there and that is one of our public beaches that we need to protect and I want to see the work done to be able to combat that. Alcock said, MWC is the only organization thats been doing research on algal blooms since we started seeing them in Muskoka. Renwick again said the project is very important, she suggested giving MWC 20,000 but said she would support 15,000. We should be leaders on this In the end, a majority of councillors voted in favour of setting aside 15,000 for the Muskoka Watershed Council as part of the 2024 budget discussions.|1

This system, along with sea walls, enables Singapore to do something extraordinary reclaim land thats below sea level. Still, Singapore has more intense rain, so its ponds, drainage canals and pumps are designed to cope with more water.|Bloomberg Markets During a halfcentury of independence, Singapore has fought to expand its territory, inch by hardwon inch. On the tip of the Malaysian peninsula, the island citystate piled up sand to expand its coastline and reclaim land from the sea. In that time, Singapore has grown by onequarter, adding landmass more than twice the size of Manhattan. At 284 square miles, Singapore is now approaching the size of all five boroughs of New York City. It plans to grow an additional 4 by 2030. Its a striking accomplishment, given that many other coasts are receding because of rising sea levels, a result of climate change. We are not planning to lose any inch of land permanently, says Ho Chai Teck, a deputy director at PUB, the government agency coordinating the effort to save the nations shores. Singapore will build a continuous line of defense along our entire coast. This is something that we take very seriously. Roughly onethird of Singapore is less than 16 feet above sea level, low enough for flooding to cause punishing financial losses. Some of its most prized property sits on vulnerable land the skyscrapers overlooking the Marina Bay waterfront, known for its luxury mall and casino, and the towers that house giant banks such as Singaporebased DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Southeast Asias largest, and UKbased Standard Chartered Plc. Assuming 1.5C of warming, prime real estate in the city worth S70 billion 50 billion faces a high risk of flooding, according to Bloomberg estimates using data from real estate company CBRE Group Inc. Another endangered, and vital, part of the country is Jurong Island, where Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. have oil and petrochemical operations. Youve got small island nations, but they dont have this much economic wealth, says Benjamin Horton, a professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who studies sealevel change. The actual value of every square meter in Singapore is off the charts. This is a country more susceptible to sealevel rise than virtually any country in the world. In 2019, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore would need to spend S100 billion over the next 100 years to protect against rising sea levels. The government has since put S5 billion toward a coastal and flood protection fund. Both the Singapore Armed Forces and climate change defenses are existential, he said then. These are lifeanddeath matters. Everything else must bend at the knee to safeguard the existence of our island nation. A days bike ride along Singapores coastal paths will take you past glittering skyscrapers and scenic dams, beaches and mangrove swampsdiverse scenes that make clear how the country must carefully tailor its approach. What Singapore does will be keenly watched by other populous coastal cities such as Bangkok, Miami, New York and Shanghai. Fortifying the City On a recent weekday, tourists and locals fly kites on a towering structure with dazzling views of Singapores skyline. But what theyre standing on is much more than an attraction. Its a S226 million dam called the Marina Barrage. Inside, seven giant pumps drain excess water into the sea during high tide and extreme rainfall. Currently, some kind of humanmade barrier protects 70 of Singapores coastline. But the citystate will have to reinforce and improve those shields as tropical storms increase and sea levels rise. The Hydroinformatics Institute and National University of Singapore are working with PUB to build a computer model simulating the combined effects of sealevel rise and rainfall on the countrys coastlines. When completed in 2025, it will help assess which areas are most vulnerable, based on the predicted depth and duration of floods. We have to look at this in a very dynamic way, Grace Fu, minister for sustainability and the environment, said at a September event launching a new coast and flood protection institute. Protecting us too much, you waste a lot of resources. If you build the coastal protection solution too low, then you will find that, several generations later, youll need to enhance it. Government authorities are already considering storm surge barriers on Singapores waterways. The barriers would generally be open, so ships can travel to their destinations. But during a big storm, they would close, encircling the citys industrial areas. Other possible measures raising the height of current coastal reservoir dikes tide gates, which block water and more embankments, typically raised piles of earth. Singapore is also building a huge additional terminal at its airport on higher ground, 18 feet above average sea level. More than 6 miles of drainage are planned to keep runways clear of water. Businesses are getting into the act, too. Real estate company City Developments Ltd. has built barriers and waterlevel sensors at the St. Regis Singapore hotel, Palais Renaissance shopping mall and Republic Plaza skyscraper. In the business district, Frasers Propertys 38story tower has added floodgates. More still needs to be done, says David Fogarty, CBREs head of ESG consulting services for Singapore and Southeast Asia. Companies are thinking about rising sea levels, but they arent acting fast enough. Enlisting Nature At the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, the roots of mangrove trees have all kinds of configurations. They can look like a pencil, a bent knee or a stilt. The tropical trees flourish in salty tidal waters. Their thick aboveground roots and trunks break waves and trap sedimentforming a natural barrier to rising seas. To protect shorelines properly, mangrove forests should sprawl for hundreds of yards. In neighboring Indonesia, they can even stretch for miles. In Singapore, mangroves can reduce storm wave heights by more than 75. Mangrove forests also soak up to four times as much carbon as rainforests. But mangroves alone arent enough. Singapore is studying whether it can combine the trees with other barriers, called revetments, often made of stone or concrete. Experiments involving combined mangroverock revetments are underway at Kranji Coastal Nature Park, near the wetland reserve, and Pulau Hantu, an island off the southern coast. Singapores existing sea walls and revetments limit one possible solution, encouraging the growth of more mangrove habitat, says Daisuke Taira, a mangrove researcher at the National University of Singapores Centre for Naturebased Climate Solutions. The country should preserve the current habitat of tropical trees, and their protective roots, researchers say. But it will likely have to rely more on barriers and other feats of engineering. When it comes to cultivating mangroves to keep the seas at bay, Taira says, Singapore is one of the most challenging places. Borrowing From the Dutch On Pulau Tekong, an island northeast of Singapore, giant machinery whirs and clanks as workers stabilize soil and lay out a network of intricately designed drains and pumps. The equipment collects and channels rainwater into a pond. Excess can then be pumped into the ocean. This system, along with sea walls, enables Singapore to do something extraordinary reclaim land thats below sea level. Singapore is taking a page from the Netherlands, a third of which is below sea level. The Dutch built sea walls beyond their coastline, creating new tracts of land they call polders. A beanshaped plot of land on Pulau Tekong is the first polder in Singapore. At 3 square miles, it will add 1 to Singapores landmass once its completed at the end of 2024 and will be used for military training. Polders use less sand than the kind of reclamation Singapore has used in the past. Thats a huge advantage because its one of the worlds biggest importers of sand, which is expensive. Singapore is adapting Dutch methods to the tropics. Its corner of the Pacific is calmer than the North Atlantic, so sea walls dont need to be as high as in the Netherlands, according to JanJaap Brinkman, a director at Dutch water research institute Deltares, which is advising Singapore. Still, Singapore has more intense rain, so its ponds, drainage canals and pumps are designed to cope with more water. Brinkman says the government is learning on its own and starting relatively small on Pulau Tekong Singapore wants to see if the technology is safe, and ensure everything is working well, before it takes the next step.

The rapid increase in mortgage rates contributed to a significant increase in mortgage payments for those with a variable mortgage rate. But this has more to do with a decline in borrowing costs than with a decrease in housing prices. Hoping for a recession to decrease housing prices is like wishing for a flood to water your garden. Furthermore, falling housing prices could have unintended consequences since consumers will reduce their demand for other goods and services.|0929 biz wire deloitte Housing sales data from the Toronto region suggests markets will likely favour buyers given the sudden increase in listings some are even calling it a buyers market. Homebuyers choices have undoubtedly improved, but affordability has not improved as much. For markets to be fully on the buyers side, they need plenty of choice and affordability. Thousands more homes are available to purchase, but most remain out of reach of midincome earners. There was a 32 per cent increase in listings in September, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board TRREB, dropping the salestonewlistings ratio SNLR to 28.6 per cent. The industry rule of thumb says an SNLR of less than 40 per cent favours buyers and more than 60 per cent to favour sellers. Going just by that rule, it looks like a buyers market. The same report also said the average Toronto home price in September increased by three per cent from August. The average has increased by almost eight per cent since January. If housing was unaffordable earlier, it is still unaffordable. Housing affordability is tied as much to prices as it is to mortgage payments. Affordability worsens if either or both sharply increase. Homebuyers have recently been hit with a double whammy of rising prices and borrowing costs. Housing prices starting in mid2020 escalated fast as ultralow interest rates fuelled their growth. Later, inflationary pressures necessitated an increase in lending rates, which jumped from those ultralow levels in 2020 to much higher levels not seen in decades. The consequences were unavoidable higher housing prices were financed at even higher lending rates. The rapid increase in mortgage rates contributed to a significant increase in mortgage payments for those with a variable mortgage rate. Almost 60 per cent of Canadian homeowners have a mortgage, many of whom had opted for variable mortgage rates earlier. The Bank of Canada maintains a housing affordability index, a ratio of the average quarterly mortgage payment to the average quarterly income. A higher index value suggests worsening affordability. The index dropped when mortgage rates were low and in mid2020 hit its lowest level since the Great Recession. Story continues However, the index increased by 60 per cent by the third quarter of 2022, suggesting worsening affordability. Affordability continued to worsen even when average prices declined in 2022. Higher borrowing costs wiped out the gains from falling prices. Most supply skeptics argue that building more homes wont improve affordability as much as others think. But they do think an economic recession might help since housing price declines are correlated with recessions. To an extent, the Bank of Canadas affordability index supports the recession argument. The index has declined during past recessions, suggesting improved affordability. But this has more to do with a decline in borrowing costs than with a decrease in housing prices. Hoping for a recession to decrease housing prices is like wishing for a flood to water your garden. Policywise, a recession would likely be overkill for restoring affordability. Furthermore, falling housing prices could have unintended consequences since consumers will reduce their demand for other goods and services. Building more housing is a prudent way forward to improve affordability. Statistics Canada prescribes building 3.5 million more homes by 2030 in addition to what would have been constructed under the businessasusual scenario. This will require lots of capital. Aled ab Iorwerth, deputy chief economist at Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., puts the cumulative price tag for building a sufficient number of homes at 1 trillion, a sizable, even prohibitive, amount for a 2.2trillion economy. There are currently land, labour and construction material shortages on top of capital constraints standing in the way of building millions of more homes. The federal government recently partnered with two municipalities in Ontario to assist them in speeding up new housing construction. The federal 100millionplus investment from the Housing Accelerator Fund is also a step in the right direction. But given the size of the challenge, governments will have to graduate from taking baby steps to giant leaps. Otherwise, frustrated buyers cannot be blamed for hoping for a recession.

In addition, a clip was posted of attendees running for their lives. Some left in a hurry. Some fled across the desert. Some of them were running on the ground. However, not only many people have been killed by such attacks. There are still many women who have been sexually assaulted. Hamas launched attacks on several areas in Israel on Saturday morning October 7, launching rockets from the Gaza Strip. This is an area where Palestinians live densely. It is claimed that up to 5,000 rockets were fired, some of which reportedly landed as far away as Tel Aviv, Israel. The site is 70 kilometers away. Not only that, Israel said that members of the armed Hamas movement killed and kidnapped Israelis living near Gaza. This prompted Israel to launch a military operation in response to the attack.

State television MRTV reported Monday evening that the number of displaced people in Bago township, about 68 kilometers 42 miles northeast of Yangon, the countrys biggest city, had climbed to that figure, and they were taking shelter in 36 relief camps. It said almost 1,000 more people in Mon states township, just east of Bago, were sheltering in three relief camps, and there some evacuations in a northern part of Yangon. A senior official at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, Lay Shwe Zin Oo, said that constant rainfall in the Bago region that began last week caused the flooding in the lowlying areas of its capital, Bago township. She said there were no casualties reported so far. Bago township recorded 7.87 inches 200 millimeters of rainfall, its highest level in 59 years, Myanmars Meteorological Department said Sunday. Rain or thundershowers was forecast for across the country until noon on Tuesday. One of the leaders of an emergency rescue team in Bago told The Associated Press that the flooding was up to about eight feet 2.3 meters deep in lowlying areas and four feet 1.2 meters downtown. Almost the whole area of the town was flooded, Thant Zin Maung, chairman of the Mizzima Thukha Charity Foundation said by phone on Monday. It is the third flood in the town this year and the worst in many years. All the monasteries in the town have opened relief camps. Charity organizations are evacuating people from lowlying areas as much as they can. A 55yearold resident of Bagos Pan Hlaing ward interviewed by phone said the floodwaters were as much as six feet 1.8 meters deep in her neighborhood, and her family members were living on the second and third floors of their house. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Myanmars military government prefers to tightly control the release of information, said the water was still rising steadily in her neighborhood, which had never flooded badly before. Social Welfare Ministry official Lay Shwe Zin Oo said Bago evacuees were sheltering in relief camps, schools and Buddhist monasteries, while the authorities were providing food, drinking water and other essential assistance. Reports in the staterun Myanmar Alinn newspaper on Monday said that trains that departed from Mandalay, the countrys secondlargest city in central Myanmar, and from southern Mawlamyine township were halted en route. Scheduled departures from Yangon, the biggest city in the country, were canceled after rail lines were flooded by the rapid flow of water from mountain torrents and the spillage from dams in the Bago region. MRTV said almost 1,000 people in Mon states Kyaikto township, just east of Bago, were sheltering in three relief camps, and there some evacuations as well in a northern part of Yangon. Myanmar experiences extreme weather virtually every year during the monsoon season. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people. In July and August this year, floods in Mon, Kayin and Rakhine states and the regions of Bago and Magway killed five people and displaced about 60,000.|1

He says green infrastructure can be expensive to install and need a bit more maintenance than a simple sewer pipe, which has made some municipalities more hesitant. Amon adds that green infrastructure can also contribute to more equitable neighbourhoods by adding foodbearing trees, culturally significant plants and more greenery to neighbourhoods that lack it. Green infrastructure is amazing, because it can be transformative in so many different ways, she said.|Idea is to divert stormwater into vegetated areas so less ends up in sewers From green roofs in Toronto to Vancouvers rain city strategy, Canadian cities are looking to become sponges in order to help mitigate some of the effects of extreme rainfall events. In Montreal, Mayor Valrie Plante announced last week that the city plans to develop some 30 additional sponge parks designed to catch and absorb rainwater and keep it from flowing into overburdened sewers during extreme rain events. Those, combined with an additional 400 sponge sidewalks, featuring added vegetation squares, will help the city retain the equivalent of three Olympic swimming pools in water at half the cost of underground works, the city said in a news release. Melanie Glorieux, a sustainable landscape planner with the firm Rousseau Lefebvre said that while the concept of building a sponge city isnt new, its an idea that more and more municipalities are embracing as they cope with extreme weather. The idea, she said, is to divert stormwater into low areas or channels planted with trees, shrubs and grasses, so that more of it is absorbed on the surface and less flows into sewers, lakes or rivers. As an added benefit, the plants filter the water before it enters the system, removing some of the pollutants it picks up from streets. Firstly, we reduce the quantity of water sent to sewers, and secondly, we improve the quality of what is there, she said The goal is to reverse some of the harm done by the last 40 to 50 years of caroriented urban development, which involved replacing natural spaces that soak up water with impermeable infrastructure such as roads and parking lots. In place of absorption, water was redirected to underground sewer systems, which can become overwhelmed by heavy rain, causing flooding and contamination of rivers. The sponge city concept, which first rose to prominence in China, is essentially the opposite limit runoff and maximize infiltration, Glorieux said. Green infrastructure can be incorporated into a landscape in many ways, from simple tree planting to rain gardens, swales, holding ponds and more complex bioretention systems that involve layers of filtering, she said. Some projects are also replacing asphalt with permeable paving that allows better water flow. Glorieux said most of the green infrastructure water retention areas are designed to absorb the first 25 millimetres of rainfall, which means they should be able to handle about 95 per cent of rain events. Emily Amon, the director of green infrastructure at Green Communities Canada, says the combination of increasingly severe weather events due to climate change and urbanization has led to real losses on the landscape in terms of our ability to absorb that stormwater we receive. On July 13, Montreal received a months worth of rain in less than two hours, causing some 85 millimetres of rain to flood underpasses, overflow from sewers and force city officials to warn citizens to stay away from waterways due to possible contamination. The nonprofit Green Communities Canada works with other organizations to help municipalities create green infrastructure, including planting mini forests and gardens that absorb rain and removing the pavement from old parking lots. Across Canada, cities appear to be jumping on board. Toronto has won praise for its bylaw requiring new developments greater than 2,000 square metres to have green roofs over part of their surfaces. The roofs soak up rainwater that otherwise would run off into sewers. Vancouver, Amon said, has implemented a rain city strategy that aims to integrate green infrastructure throughout planning decisions. She said the Federation of Canadian Municipalities has started a natural asset management program that encourages cities to categorize and put a dollar value on their green infrastructure so it can be better managed a strategy that was pioneered in Gibsons, B.C. Guillaume Grgoire, an assistant professor who studies plant sciences and green infrastructure at Universit Laval in Quebec City, says green infrastructure does not really have any downside, but it has to occupy a good part of the territory in order to have a true effect. He says green infrastructure can be expensive to install and need a bit more maintenance than a simple sewer pipe, which has made some municipalities more hesitant. However, he said comparative studies have shown that the cost over time is the same or less than that of upgrading sewer systems, even when the extra maintenance is taken into account. All three experts say that in addition to stormwater management, the sponge city model brings other benefits, including increased biodiversity, reduced heat island effect, attractive public spaces and more exposure to nature, which contributes to better mental health. Amon adds that green infrastructure can also contribute to more equitable neighbourhoods by adding foodbearing trees, culturally significant plants and more greenery to neighbourhoods that lack it. Green infrastructure is amazing, because it can be transformative in so many different ways, she said.|1

Article content The provincial government mandates each fire department create a Community Risk Assessment at least every five years and review it annually. A community risk assessment is a process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and prioritizing risks to public safety to inform decisions about the provision of fire protection services, the government clarified. The risk assessment allows the department and council to make informed decisions, the Chief explained, when evaluating risks to the public. We can directly address the identified risks, and make sure that our services match those needs. Part of the report details the geographic features of the area. For instance, the railway tracks. The tracks can impact response times and protocols and also increases likelihood of a hazardous materials incident. Having a secondary highway cut through the municipality can also impact travel times to calls.

Article content Living within a large, forested area creates opportunities for remote rescues, and increases the odds of having to deal with a forest fire. There are plenty of walking trails in East Ferris, which increases the risk of having to perform searches through the woods. Chief Amyotte considered it all and included it within the risk assessment. Most of East Ferris residents are between the ages of 45 to 64. Just over half of the population range from 45 to over 85, which suggests the department may need to consider risks more associated with older people. Heart attacks, how limited mobility might affect evacuations, and other issues that could pose risks to residents. So, the department and council may want to allocate more resources to these concerns. Perhaps push harder on the importance of maintaining smoke alarms and other fire safety messages like having a rehearsed egress plan from your home.

Article content Part of the report lists hazards within the municipality and the risk these pose. Storms top the list, floods are possible, and a forest fire, water rescue and remote forest rescue are listed as likely to occur, with a moderate risk level. Transportation emergencies are listed as unlikely to occur. Buildings collapsing Explosions and fires All are listed in the rare category, with a very low risk level. The lists are compiled from recent experience. For instance, storms are much more common in the municipality than a house fire. But, if the number of fires increases dramatically, then the risk will rise accordingly in the next report. For example, the Public Works Garage did burn down recently, so now it is listed as a possible fire hazard in this years report.

False calls amount to around 7 per cent, and false calls specifically regarding fires amount to 11 per cent of total calls. In 2020 there were 67 calls, and that jumped to 150 in 2021. Last year, there were 170. The risk assessment is a living document, Chief Amyotte said.

Article content Housing affordability is tied as much to prices as it is to mortgage payments. Affordability worsens if either or both sharply increase. Homebuyers have recently been hit with a double whammy of rising prices and borrowing costs. Housing prices starting in mid2020 escalated fast as ultralow interest rates fuelled their growth. Later, inflationary pressures necessitated an increase in lending rates, which jumped from those ultralow levels in 2020 to much higher levels not seen in decades. The consequences were unavoidable higher housing prices were financed at even higher lending rates. The rapid increase in mortgage rates contributed to a significant increase in mortgage payments for those with a variable mortgage rate. Almost 60 per cent of Canadian homeowners have a mortgage, many of whom had opted for variable mortgage rates earlier. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The Bank of Canada maintains a housing affordability index, a ratio of the average quarterly mortgage payment to the average quarterly income. A higher index value suggests worsening affordability. The index dropped when mortgage rates were low and in mid2020 hit its lowest level since the Great Recession. However, the index increased by 60 per cent by the third quarter of 2022, suggesting worsening affordability. Affordability continued to worsen even when average prices declined in 2022. Higher borrowing costs wiped out the gains from falling prices. Most supply skeptics argue that building more homes wont improve affordability as much as others think. But they do think an economic recession might help since housing price declines are correlated with recessions. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content To an extent, the Bank of Canadas affordability index supports the recession argument. The index has declined during past recessions, suggesting improved affordability. But this has more to do with a decline in borrowing costs than with a decrease in housing prices. Hoping for a recession to decrease housing prices is like wishing for a flood to water your garden. Policywise, a recession would likely be overkill for restoring affordability. Furthermore, falling housing prices could have unintended consequences since consumers will reduce their demand for other goods and services. Building more housing is a prudent way forward to improve affordability. Statistics Canada prescribes building 3.5 million more homes by 2030 in addition to what would have been constructed under the businessasusual scenario. This will require lots of capital.

And Im looking at annual flood risk, a storm expected roughly once a year.|This online risk map shows the areas around St. Johns harbour that are at risk of being below annual flood levels by 2030. Climate Central Roads, beaches, historic sites, and other coastal features around Newfoundland and Labrador are highly vulnerable to sea level rise and annual flooding by the end of this decade, should climate change continue unchecked and a new online tool hopes to provide early warnings to the most vulnerable areas. The locations most at risk are mapped out at Climate Central, using the latest data from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Among the tools and resources offered by the New Jerseybased nonprofit organization of scientists and communicators, the Coastal Risk map offers the clearest forecast for the provinces shoreline. Most of the province is safe from rising waters, according to Peter Girard, Climate Centrals vicepresident of external communications. The land rises relatively quickly as it climbs up from the beaches and flats, said Girard, surveying the map from his home in New Jersey. You dont see a huge amount of risk when you look at it from that angle. But when you zoom in, its a different picture for some areas. Slow and steady encroachment Rather than the destruction wrought by an event like posttropical storm Fiona in Port aux Basques in 2022, some areas are looking at a slow and steady encroachment by the North Atlantic. Locations in the red zone those likely facing forced retreat or adaptation due to rising seas and annual flooding include the Outer Battery in St. Johns, Riverside Drive in Corner Brook, and parts of the Colony of Avalon site in Ferryland. That land is lower than the projected height of the water, said Girard. Its at flood risk. And Im looking at annual flood risk, a storm expected roughly once a year. I can see where it is expected to reach inland beyond some of the roads that ring the shoreline. Most of Newfoundland and Labrador is safe from rising sea levels, says Climate Centrals Peter Girard, but some areas are at risk from the encroaching North Atlantic Ocean. Submitted by Peter Girard The map, he added, like the other tools at Climate Central, is designed for use by anyone. Its powered by Google, So if you know Google Maps you can use our maps. Search any location, zoom in, and pan around. Areas at risk can be tracked by decade, from 2030 to 2100. Results can be adjusted to account for how aggressively the world might respond to climate change. Unchecked pollution until 2100 can be compared with a future that includes modest or deep cuts to global carbon emissions. Theres also a Luck slider. Its default setting is in the middle. Drag the button left for the most optimistic scenario, and right for the most pessimistic.

Following days of torrential rain in the northeastern state of Sikkim, torrents of water swept down narrow river valleys from Lohnak Lake, damaging a dam and wreaking destruction in villages and Rangpo town, about 50 km 30 miles south of state capital Gangtok. Sikkims Chief Secretary Vijay Bhushan Pathak, the most senior bureaucrat, told Reuters that rescuers had found 25 bodies in the state and bodies of eight army men washed away were found in the neighbouring downstream state of West Bengal. He said 101 people were still missing in the latest of a series of natural disasters caused by extreme weather events in the Himalayas. Fourteen army personnel were among the missing, a Defence Ministry statement said. The search for survivors was hampered by damaged roads, poor communications and bad weather, and residents were struggling to clear sludge and debris in the wake of one of the worst disasters in the remote region in more than 50 years.

A statement from the federal government said chief secretary Pathak told a meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee that road connectivity has been established in most areas, 28 relief camps established and more than 6,800 people given shelter there. As a result of improvement in weather conditions, it has become possible to start evacuation and air lifting of stranded people. Eighty people have been evacuated this morning, the statement quoted Pathak as saying. Federal cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba said portable bridges known as Bailey bridges should be launched on priority to restore road connectivity for people where bridges have been washed away, the statement said. Evacuation of people in shortest possible time should be the priority, Gauba said.

Extreme rainfall from hurricanestrength Storm Daniel hit eastern Libya on Sept. 10, flooding the city of Derna and other neighboring towns and regions. UNESCO experts are expected to visit Cyrene, a World Heritage Site that is threatened with collapse after the flooding sent water circulating around its foundations. They will carry out an initial survey of the flood damage and the structures in need of rapid reinforcement, according to a statement from the agency. Other sites of rich archeological heritage in Libya will also be inspected, notably the Ancient City of Ptolemais and The Haua Fteah Cave, both of which are on the national World Heritage Tentative List, as well as the ancient city of Apollonia. Storm Daniel caused serious damage and created a high risk of collapse in Cyrene, one of the five cities of the Hellenic period which gave its name to Libyas eastern province, Cyrenaica. In the framework of this mission, requested by Libya, UNESCO intends to examine how to contribute to helping rebuild the affected areas. Among these zones is the city of Derna, which was the worst hit by the flooding. Much of the city was swept away into the Mediterranean, along with its inhabitants, by the massive floods caused by the collapse of two dams on a usually dry riverbed that bisects the city. The UNESCO delegation yesterday met officials from the ministries of education and culture in order to identify their needs and decide which measures to implement most urgently. According to the last toll given yesterday by authorities in eastern Libya, the floods in Derna left 4,200 dead, while thousands more remain missing. The storm hit other areas in eastern Libya, including the towns of Bayda, Susa, Marj and Shahatt. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in the region and took shelter in schools and other government buildings. The two dams outside the city of Derna broke up after they were overwhelmed by Storm Daniel, which caused heavy rain across eastern Libya. Two weeks after the dams collapsed, local and international teams were still digging through mud and hollowedout buildings to look for victims. They also are combing the Mediterranean Sea off Derna for the bodies of people who were swept away.|1

I was in Sudbury, Ontario and I was very much part of that closed adoption process.|Two city councillors talked tonight about their personal experiences with adoption Sault Ste. Marie city council voted tonight to investigate the possibility of establishing a secure dropoff location where babies may be anonymously surrendered. At the request of Ward 3 Coun. Angela Caputo and her Ward 2 counterpart Lisa VezeauAllen, council agreed to look into setting up a temperaturecontrolled Hopes Cradle bassinet box, most likely at a local fire station. Established by Calgarybased domestic abuse survivors charity Gems for Gems, Hopes Cradle offers mothers and caregivers a judgmentfree process for legally surrendering infants to childrens service professionals. The programs first two baby boxes were built into exterior walls in fire stations in Strathmore, Alberta, and Tach, Manitoba. Another is expected to open this fall in Clarington in Ontarios Durham region. Coun. Caputo talked at tonights city council meeting about her adopted infant daughter, Leo. Coun. VezeauAllen talked about being herself adopted. The vote was unanimous, except for Ward 5 Coun. Corey Gardi, who didnt attend the meeting. As many of you know, my daughter Leo entered into my life via adoption, Coun. Caputo said. So Im familiar with the adoption process. And while I am grateful for it, I want everyone to understand that it is not easy. It is not a simple process. And it is one that a lot of folks who might be suffering with mental health and addiction or have past traumas would really struggle to complete, Caputo said. So I have a little shout out to Leos birth mother. Without her I dont know where I would be. She searched for me. When she found me, she knew that she and that little unborn little girl had found the person that they were looking for. She fought to get through this adoption process. Not everyone would. Some dont have access to a phone for the many scheduled calls. Some would simply break, through the many mandated therapy sessions delving into their past traumas. And frankly, some would face violence or persecution, if anyone even found out they were pregnant. I will never pretend to understand the pain on a birth mothers heart when having to make a decision not to parent a child. Tonight, we have the option to potentially save lives for a very small cost. And given the crisis that we are facing as a community with mental health and addictions, I beg you to vote yes on this, Caputo said. I myself have an adoption story. I was adopted, said Coun. VezeauAllen. I was born in 1967. I was in Sudbury, Ontario and I was very much part of that closed adoption process. In my adoption papers it actually lied and said my dad was a law student. He was a bartender, VezeauAllen said. I also want to be very clear that Im very pro choice. I believe in a womans right to choose and this comes from a very lived experience a very heartfelt experience. Installing a Hopes Cradle baby box costs about 20,000. I think its really just about understanding how a woman might feel when shes faced with this decision and how she may not have cultural supports, financial support, the ability to make a decision Im extremely fortunate to have met my birth mother at the age of 34. I cannot even understand at the age of 21 how she felt and I later found out later in life, that my aunt her sister actually wanted to adopt me but they wouldnt allow that because she was a single woman, even though she was a nurse and quite willing to take care of me So change needs to happen. People need to be open about these things, VezeauAllen told the meeting. I hope all of my colleagues on council will support this. Its about keeping our community safe and giving people choice. It started for a reason. Ward 1 Coun. Sonny Spina said This is going to be an extremely important report coming back from staff. In the last couple of days, I had some important conversations with some folks who work in the child protection area in our community.... I want to just encourage staff... to have those conversations and include as many people as possible with Indigenous job services, local child services, appropriate government officials. Because from what Im told theres rapidly changing laws, procedures that are going on with adoptions right now. I think its important for us to have all of that picture looking forward and I really believe this is going to be a very important report. We have to get it right the first time. Im thankful that this has come forward and Im thankful that we have the opportunity to have this discussion. I just want to make sure we get it right and include as many people as possible to get that right, Spina said.|1

File A total of 176 tourists were on Tuesday airlifted from North Sikkim, which has been ravaged by a flash flood in the Teesta river, Chief Secretary VB Pathak said. With this, a total of 690 tourists, including 26 foreigners, have been rescued by air from the Lachen and Lachung towns in North Sikkim by the Indian Air Force IAF since Monday, he said. While seven IAF helicopters were deployed on Monday, four were deployed on Tuesday to bring the tourists to the Pakyong airport, he added. Additionally, 499 people tourists and locals were shifted from North Sikkim to Mangan by other modes of transportation, from where they left for Gangtok in staterun buses and private taxis, Pathak said. Nearly 1,200 people have been shifted from the North Sikkim district so far, he said. The remaining tourists stranded in North Sikkim will be moved on Wednesday as the India Meteorological Department IMD has forecast clear weather, he said.

The telecommunication and power infrastructure has been restored in most areas of North Sikkim, one of the worstaffected districts, he said. Almost a week after the flash flood, which happened in the early hours of October 4, 76 people are still missing. So far, 36 bodies have been found in Sikkim, while 41 bodies have been found at various places along the river in neighbouring West Bengal, according to officials in the two states. A cloudburst in the Lhonak glacial lake led to the discharge of huge quantity of water, which triggered a flash flood in the Teesta river, flooding towns and villages and affecting about 87,300 people.

For JTTM subscription information, click here. On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched operation AlAqsa Flood also Known as AlAqsa Storm, a largescale surprise attack on Israel. As part of the attack, the Gazabased terrorist group fired thousands of rockets into Israel and dispatched fighters into Israeli towns and communities near the Gaza Strip.1 On October 8, 2023, the Telegram channel of the Hamas mouthpiece AlRisalah posted an article according to which senior members of the Iranled antiU.S. and antiIsrael axis of resistance, among them senior officials from Hamas, Iranbacked Iraqi militias, and the Houthi Ansar Allah movement in Yemen, warned the U.S. against intervening in the fighting to help Israel and threatened that any such intervention would lead to the involvement of all the forces of the axis of resistance in the campaign and endanger all the U.S. interests in the region. According to the AlRisalah website, senior officials of the axis of resistance informed it that the U.S. should beware the results of its blatant intervention in Israels favor in the fighting currently going on in the Gaza Strip, including equipping Israel with advanced weapons to perpetrate massacres against the residents of the Gaza Strip. The same officials told AlRisalah that American intervention will put U.S. interests in the area at great risk and the gates of hell will open to them its embassies in the region will be targets for attack and military surprises, and the AlAqsa Flood will drown its presence in the region. Hazem Qasem, a senior member of Hamas, said that if the U.S. brings its weapons and uses them in the region, it will become a full partner of Israels in its crimes against the Palestinian people. Nasr AlShammari, the deputy leader and spokesman of the Iraqi AlNujaba Movement militia, said that American intervention and the dispatch of naval vessels to the region would constitute a declaration of war on the entire region and a threat to all the peoples of the region. He asserted that such interference would transform the U.S. into a major player in the aggression, and would encounter a firm response which would endanger the American interests in Iraq and transform all its sites in the region into targets for attack. AlShammari asserted that the resistance will not abandon its role in the attack on the American interests in all of Iraq, and will make the U.S. regret its position. He added that, the Palestinian people will not remain alone in this war, and the resistance in every place is ready to transform the campaign into a flood that will drown its the American interests. Major General Abdallah AlJafari, spokesman for the aerial defense forces of the Houthi Ansar Allah movement in Yemen, declared that the campaign being led by the Palestinian resistance is the start of a comprehensive campaign that all the forces of the axis of resistance will join. He also said that Washington wants to protect its forward operating base in the region, in the form of the Israeli entity, but it will realize that all its bases are in range of attack. He further claimed that Yemen has accurate missiles called Toophan missiles which have a 2,000 km range, and can hit Tel Aviv and beyond, as far as Dimona in the south. He also contended that Yemen has drones with a range of more than 2,500 km, which can carry various warheads, including cluster bombs. According to AlJafari, the Toophan missiles have a speed greater than Mach 50, carry warheads of various sizes, and can attack the Israeli nuclear facilities. He also contended that among the axis forces there is a clear agreement according to which if one arena is in need of assistance, the others will come to its aid, and the American presence portends the intervention of the other arenas in the campaign.2 It is notable that since Hamas launched the surprise attack against Israel, the Iranbacked militias in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen have vowed to support Hamas and the Palestinian factions which have joined the fighting, and have explicitly threatened to attack American targets in the region in the event of American intervention in the fighting in Israels favor.3|1

But it has received a broadside of criticism, including from a top European Union official, questioning the adequacy of the response. Outside watchdog groups said misinformation about the war abounds on the platform, whose workforce including its content moderation team was gutted by billionaire Elon Musk after he bought it last year. Fake and manipulated imagery circulating on X include repurposed old images of unrelated armed conflicts or military footage that actually originated from video games, said a Tuesday letter to Musk from European Commissioner Thierry Breton. This appears to be manifestly false or misleading information. Breton, the EUs digital rights chief, also warned Musk that authorities have been flagging potentially illegal content that could violate EU laws and you must be timely, diligent and objective in removing it when warranted. San Franciscobased X didnt immediately respond to a request for comment about Bretons letter. A post late Monday from Xs safety team claimed it is treating the crisis with utmost effort In the past couple of days, weve seen an increase in daily active users on X in the conflict area, plus there have been more than 50 million posts globally focusing on the weekends terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas. As the events continue to unfold rapidly, a crosscompany leadership group has assessed this moment as a crisis requiring the highest level of response. That includes continuing a policy frequently championed by Musk of letting users help rate what might be misinformation, which causes those posts to include a note of context but not disappear from the platform. The struggle to identify reliable sources for news about the war was exacerbated over the weekend by Musk, who on Sunday posted the names of two accounts he said were good for following the war in realtime. Analyst Emerson Brooking of the Atlantic Council called one of those accounts absolutely poisonous. Journalists and X users also pointed out that both accounts had previously shared a fake AIgenerated image of an explosion at the Pentagon, and that one of them had posted numerous antisemitic comments in recent months. Musk later deleted his post. Brooking posted on X that Musk had enabled fake war reporting by abandoning the blue check verification system for trusted accounts and allowing anyone to buy a blue check. Brooking said Tuesday that it is significantly harder to determine ground truth in this conflict as compared to Russias invasion of Ukraine last year and Elon Musk bears personal responsibility for this. He said Musks changes to the X platform have made it impossible to quickly assess the credibility of accounts while his introduction of view monetization has created perverse incentives for warfocused accounts to post as many times as possible, even unverified rumors, and to make the most salacious claims possible. War is always a cauldron of tragedy and disinformation Musk has made it worse, he added. Further, Brooking said via email Musk has repeatedly and purposefully denigrated the idea of an objective media, and he made platform design decisions that undermine such reporting. We now see the result. Part of Musks drastic changes over the past year included removing many of the people responsible for moderating toxic content and harmful misinformation. One former member of Twitters public policy team said the company is having a harder time taking action on posts that violate its policies because there arent enough people to do that work. The layoffs are undermining the capacity of Twitters trust and safety team, and associated teams like public policy, to provide needed support during a critical time of crisis, said Theodora Skeadas, one of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in the months after Musk bought the company. X says it changed one policy over the weekend to enable people to more easily choose whether or not to see sensitive media without the company actually taking down those posts. X believes that, while difficult, its in the publics interest to understand whats happening in real time, its statement said. The company said it is also removing newly created Hamasaffiliated accounts and working with other tech companies to try to prevent terrorist content from being distributed online. It said it is also continuing to proactively monitor for antisemitic speech as part of all our efforts. Plus weve taken action to remove several hundred accounts attempting to manipulate trending topics. Linda Yaccarino, whom Elon Musk named in May as the top executive at X, withdrew from an upcoming threeday tech conference where she was scheduled to speak, citing the need to focus on how the platform was handling the war. With the global crisis unfolding, Linda and her team must remain fully focused on X platform safety, X told the organizers of the WSJ Tech Live conference being held next week in Laguna Beach, California.

It comes as images of vicious violence and barbaric brutality once again flood social media and news programming around the world and here at home. It is so hard to digest it, when you see such raw images of violence, pain, suffering and, honestly, death, said Helen Fishburn, CEO, Canadian Mental Health Association of WaterlooWellington. Speaking on The Mike Farwell Show on Tuesday, Fishburn said the inhumanity of some of the sights can be heartbreaking but also confusing and difficult to unpack. Its a very complicated political and religious landscape in the Middle East, Fishburn said. And sometimes it leads people to stay silent as well because they dont want to offend either side. Fishburn though noted whats most important is for people to know its okay to feel whatever they may be feeling and its also okay to let those feelings show. We are all feeling such collective sadness and horror over what weve seen and what we continue to see and knowing that this is not going to end easily either, she said. Obviously we always want to make sure were educating ourselves, trying to understand, trying to be informed about these thingsbut it is very challenging, Fishburn continued. We need to just really recognize and accept that our feelings are normal responses to really extreme situations happening in other parts of the world. She also encouraged making space for others around us to feel what theyre feeling, and reminded not everyone reacts the same. She also suggested limiting our time on social media and watching the news. When you have those gruesome images just on repeatthat triggers trauma. Theres no question, she said. There are some things that we wont be able to get out of our heads or out of our hearts. Similarly, Fishburn also suggested parents consider tightening content restrictions for their kids. When you think about, like, there are hostages, there are threats being madewe do not want our kids, and frankly ourselves, to be potentially viewing things that well never be able to unsee.|1

Today, I was pleased to announce that the cityofhamilton will receive over 93M in incentive payments through the Housing Accelerator Fund to deliver significant, lasting changes to the way homes are built in Hamilton and deliver over 2,600 additional housing permits. pic.twitter.com9Q9uLWgrNZ Filomena Tassi FilomenaTassi October 10, 2023 However, the minister says the programs stemming from the investment, such as the governments 4 billion Housing Accelerator Fund, will take time. WATCH MORE Filomena Tassi makes a federal housing announcement in Hamilton at 9 a.m. This isnt the first housing crisis to hit cities like Hamilton. The Second World War saw a housing crisis hitting across the country as there was a growing shortage for those working in the war industry, followed by a flood of returning soldiers in need of somewhere to live. Nearly 80 years ago the federal governments Wartime Housing Corporation launched a homebuilding program. Built in the 1940s, 50s, and early 60s, they were known as Victory or Strawberry Box houses because of their resemblance to fruit crates. These homes are still standing across Canada, with some of the streets of areas like Hamiltons east mountain lined with the wartime bungalows and oneandahalf storey houses adorned with what have become iconic steep roofs. WATCH MORE Housing minister says Hamilton still in control of developing on expanded urban boundary The builds provided the modest and affordable homes that were needed at the time. Today HamOnt became the 3rd city in CA to receive from the Federal Housing Accelerator Fund. The 93.5mil will speed up the creation of housing through 7 initiatives, including zoning reform, accelerated permit response times to land acquisition, and brownfield development. pic.twitter.comA4dDFC5uGg Andrea Horwath AndreaHorwath October 10, 2023 Architects are now calling for federal governments to revive these kinds of buildings in areas that are struggling to build housing.

Europe was on the brink of World War II when Tove Jansson, a Scandinavian writer and artist, sat down to sketch her first Moomin story, about a snoutnosed troll living in a magical land threatened by a rising flood. The halfwritten draft was forgotten until after the war, when it was published in 1945 as The Little Trolls and the Great Flood, the first in a series of nine Moomin books, which became classics of Finnish literature. The Moomin characters adorable Little My, cheeky Snork Maiden and moody Snufkin gained international fame in 1954, when Jansson made them the protagonists of a comic strip for The Evening News, a newspaper in London. In the 1990s, the Moomins enjoyed a second wave of popularity when a Japanese and Dutch collaboration created an animated Moomin television program and a Moomin feature film. Today, the Moomins are probably Finlands most beloved cultural export, and Janssons books, written in Swedish, have been translated into more than 50 languages. But the woman behind the series, a FinnishSwedish lesbian artist and ardent pacifist, who lived with her partner for half the year on an island, is far less well known. A new exhibition, Houses of Tove Jansson, which opened in Paris at Espace MontLouis on Sept. 29, aims to bring more attention to her entire oeuvre, and how it was shaped by her utopian vision. In addition to Moomin illustrations and cartoons, the show includes Janssons paintings and sketches, as well as designs for costumes and sets much of it whimsical expressions of a wish for peace, tolerance and harmony. The show also shares biographical information about her youth, her familial relationships including with her life partner, Tuulikki Pietil and the places where she created her art. We felt that there is so much more to be said about her work, said Tuukka Laurila, a member of the Parisian art collective The Community, which curated the exhibit in collaboration with the artists estate to bring a new perspective to her work and to explore her work in todays context, he added. By understanding the biographical elements of Janssons life, Laurila said, you realize that many of the characters in the Moomin books were inspired by the people around her, and by her life. Once you know which character represents who, it gives you a reading of Toves life. Thingumy and Bob, two inseparable little creatures in dresses who speak a secret language, represent Tove and her first love, Vivica Bandler, for example. The optimistic, problemsolving TooTicky was directly inspired by Pietil, Laurila said. Such samesex relationships were criminalized in Finland until the 1970s, but they had a place in the Moomins world. In the books, there is also a focus on living in nature, developing friendships with unusual creatures, learning from challenges and finding ways to help one another. Boel Westin, a professor of childrens literature at Stockholm University who wrote a biography of Jansson, said the artist used her work to express her ideas around pacifism. During the war, she wrote in her diary that she wanted to construct a happy society and another world, Westin said. Perhaps you can see the Moomin world as a some kind of realization, or fictionalization, of that dream. Also on Artdaily Claude Cormier, landscape architect with a playful eye, dies at 63 Jansson, who died in 2001, was born in Helsinki in 1914. Her Swedish mother, illustrator Signe HammarstenJansson, and her FinnishSwedish father, sculptor Viktor Jansson, met in Paris while they were studying art. Tove started drawing as soon as she could hold a pen and went on to study art in Stockholm and Paris. At 15, she created her first illustration for Garm, a Swedishlanguage political satire magazine that openly criticized the rising fascist and communist movements of the time. She worked with the magazine until 1953, producing about 100 cover illustrations, including caricatures of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin. It was definitely risky, said Sini RinneKanto, another cocurator of the exhibition, because for much of World War II, Finland was aligned with the German Reich. Some of Janssons Garm illustrations were censored, RinneKanto added. From 1944, Jansson lived half the year in an atelier in Helsinki, and once spring came, she would spend the rest of the year with Pietil, living on a tiny island, called Klovharun, on the Finnish archipelago. The island had only one house theirs which had no electricity or running water they brought all their supplies by boat. The little house on their island was just one room, said Sophia Jansson, Toves niece, who grew up visiting the island. They also had a tent next to the house, and they slept in that most often, because they loved the idea of hearing the wind and the sea. There was another reason for living on an island In Finland, the couple could have faced arrest or legal penalties for being in a samesex relationship, but on Klovharun, they could live together openly. They spent time there for 30 years, until they grew old and Jansson became afraid of the sea. But they were not completely isolated, Sophia said. The couple regularly welcomed family and friends, in much the same way Janssons Moomin characters extend hospitality to both blood relatives and strangers. When guests would visit, the guests would sleep in the house, and Tove and Tuulikki would sleep in the tent, Sophia said. In the Moomin world, the door is always open. This idea of creating a safe home was central to Janssons writing, Westin said. In the books, home is a place where you can be secure, where you can have fun, she said, but at the same time, home is sometimes threatened by catastrophe, so you have to fight to keep it. The situations of the Moomin characters reflected Janssons reality, her niece said. That was true from the first book, in which Moomintroll and his mother go in search of Moominpapa, who is lost. Without at all exaggerating, everybody that she knew had lost somebody, Sophia said. Lots of men died at the front, so there were lots of fathers missing everyone was on the move, and the refugee theme was very prevalent. RinneKanto said many of the themes of Janssons work especially natural disaster, climate catastrophe and the plight of refugees continued to resonate with contemporary readers. Shes describing what were currently going through, RinneKanto said, but its amazing to think that she was writing these 80 years ago.

The Palestinian resistance forces are fighting to advance towards the liberation of Palestine, Samidoun, the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network wrote. Irans mission to the United Nations says Operation AlAqsa Storm is a legitimate defence against decades of Israeli occupation. As members of the labour movement in Canada, we call for an end to the Israeli occupation and apartheid in Palestine. Gaza, Gaza|No. 11 Resistance Is a Right End the Occupation of Palestine Now Militant Actions Across Canada and Worldwide Affirm Palestinians Just Struggle Palestinian Resistance Rises in Operation AlAqsa Flood Statements Labour for PalestineCanada Association of Palestinian Arab Canadians Communist Party of Israel and Democratic Front for Peace and Equality Palestinian Centre for Human Rights UN SecretaryGenerals Brief to Security Council Photo Review Actions in Canada and Around the World Resistance Is a Right End the Occupation of Palestine Now Ottawa, October 8, 2023 Shortly after the Palestinian resistance unleashed Operation AlAqsa Flood on October 7, supporters of the Palestinian cause for liberation and the many sons and daughters of Palestine living outside their homeland immediately organized actions around the world in support of the resistance. One of the main organizers for many of the actions in the UK, U.S. and Canada is the Palestinian Youth Movement. Accordingly, there was a high level of participation from the new generation of Palestinian and other youth, all of whom are taking their place in the historic movement for the liberation of Palestine. In Canada on October 7, 8 and 9, actions in the form of rallies, marches and banner drops were held in Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton, Vancouver, Toronto, London and Calgary. From October 7 to 9, at least 57 actions were held across North America and Europe alone, with more to come in the following days. The occupying forces are once again resorting to collective punishment and further crimes against the people of Gaza by waging a massive and indiscriminate bombing campaign and attempting to completely cut off Gaza, to block the entry of food, fuel and supplies to the population of 2.3 million, which can only lead to humanitarian crisis. While the border wall of Gaza was breached in multiple places and at least one border crossing was destroyed by the resistance at the start of the operation, Israel now claims that it has once again locked down Gaza. Mustafa Barghouti, General Secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, in a recent interview on CNN on the situation in Palestine, decries the attempts by the Zionists and their collaborators to criminalize the Palestinian resistance and all those who support the Palestinian cause. An excerpt from the video can be viewed here. Freedom for Palestine The narrative of unfolding events presented by the Canadian government, the cartel parties in the Parliament, the CBC and monopoly media is all based on disinformation and depriving the polity of context and the history of Palestine, to then try to justify Zionist crimes in the name of selfdefence and equate Palestinians just resistance and national liberation to terrorism. According to this dehumanizing outlook, the Palestinian people were never dispossessed of their historic homeland by the Zionists and their collaborators. Thus, their right to resist and all other rights that belong to them as a people, especially as a people living under occupation, and the historical crimes committed against them on which Israel was founded, do not exist. Such disinformation is preparing the ground for even further crimes by the Zionists. The actions across Canada and around the world in support of the Palestinian resistance make clear that this will not pass. The Israeli zionists are blinded by the imperialist outlook that might makes right and that the use of force is the deciding factor. They receive billions of dollars from the U.S. imperialists to arm themselves to the teeth and carry out innumerable crimes against the Palestinians, as well as support from Britain and big powers of Old Europe. They think that they can use force to carry out relentless expansion of illegal settlements, the collective punishment of mass incarceration and trampling the rights of the Palestinians. They refuse to negotiate and to respect their obligations under international law, and do all of this for decades with impunity. To call the Palestinian people and their resistance terrorists while theirs is a terror regime demands a reckoning which is long overdue. Support for the resistance to affirm the rights of the Palestinian people and to hold the Zionist occupiers to account is reflected in the militant and unequivocal support for the resistance and refusal of conciliate with Zionism seen in demonstrations around the world. What these actions across Canada and around the world make clear is that it is the role of the people and their organized resistance and defence of their rights which is decisive. The Communist Party of Canada MarxistLeninist reiterates its categorical condemnation of the state of Israel for its ongoing attempt to commit genocide to wipe out the Palestinian people and seize their entire territory. It condemns the government of Canada and those MPs and opposition parties who declare that the resistance fighters are terrorists while Israel is engaged in justified selfdefence and that anyone who supports the right to be of the Palestinian people is antisemitic, engaged in a hate crime and is to be prosecuted as an extremist or terrorist. It condemns the stand taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who convened the socalled Incident Response Group of ministers and senior officials and condemned the armed resistance of Palestinian fighters as terrorist attacks against Israel. He expressed Canadas full support for Israels socalled right to defend itself, which is not a right of occupiers recognized in any international law, but remained silent on the rights of the people of Palestine. On October 9, Trudeau went on to say at an Ottawa rally in support of Israel, Canada unequivocally and in the strongest possible terms condemns these terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas. We stand with Israel and reaffirm our support for Israels right to defend itself in accordance with international law. He then added, Let me be very clear Hamas terrorists are not a resistance. They arent freedom fighters, they are terrorists. And no one in Canada should be supporting them, much less celebrating them. Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre stated, Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian people, it does not speak for Muslims, and it surely does not speak for Canadians. He clearly did not see the irony in suggesting that he, on the other hand, presumably does speak for Canadians even with so many saying Canadas stand is not in our name. Poilievre went further saying, And that is why I unreservedly condemn any and all who took part in the disgusting celebrations that we have seen on our streets. Many politicians and officials at the provincial and municipal levels are also attempting to portray the resistance as terrorism and support for the resistance as support for terrorism. Canadians and Quebeckers should consider carefully what it means that after being caught redhanded giving ovations to a Nazi collaborator in the House of Commons, and then claiming that this is a mistake, Canadas socalled political leaders are now unreservedly backing Zionist crimes and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. All Out to Support the Palestinian Resistance End the Occupation Now Freedom and Justice for Palestine Palestine resistance fighters tear down fence between Gaza and occupied Palestine, October 7, 2023 At dawn on October 7, Palestinian resistance fighters launched a stunning assault from occupied Palestine to smash the siege on Gaza with a comprehensive offensive confronting the occupier by land and air, taking control of Palestinian land, seizing occupation settlers and soldiers and launching thousands of missiles. The Palestinian resistance forces are fighting to advance towards the liberation of Palestine, Samidoun, the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network wrote. They reported that Brigadier General Nimrod Aloni is one of the dozens of hostages they were able to take. The hostages are from among the occupation soldiers and settlers taken in order to liberate the 5,250 Palestinian prisoners in occupation prisons, including the 1,350 jailed without charge or trial under administrative detention, 39 women and 170 children. The operation, called AlAqsa Flood, was launched on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war in which Egypt reclaimed the occupied Sinai from Zionist occupation, and is set to alter the direction of the struggle in occupied Palestine, moving from resistance toward revolution and liberation, the organization wrote. It explained that the resistance operation comes in response to the ongoing stream of crimes against the Palestinian people, the daily murder of Palestinians on the streets of the West Bank of occupied Palestine, the siege on Gaza, the theft of land for settlements, the denial of refugees right to return, imposing exile for over 75 years, the torture and attacks on the Palestinian prisoners, the ongoing invasions of AlAqsa Mosque, and the 75 years of Zionist occupation and over 100 years of imperialist domination and colonialism throughout occupied Palestine. It also comes to bring about the liberation of Palestinian prisoners, as part and parcel of the Palestinian people and land. Samidoun continues It is a decisive rebuke to the entire path of Oslo and normalization imposed upon the Palestinian and Arab people for the past 50 years, indicating a new path forward with a clear goal liberation, and nothing less. It builds upon the liberation of south Lebanon from occupation by the Lebanese resistance, led by Hezbollah, in 2000, and the defeat of the Zionist invasion of Lebanon in 2006, as well as the successive heroic battles waged by the Palestinian resistance throughout occupied Palestine and especially from its base area of resistance land in Gaza. Samidoun has joined the Masar Badil, the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement in calling the masses of our Palestinian people, supporters of the resistance in exile and diaspora, allies from the liberation forces and movements, and solidarity committees with the Palestinian people everywhere, to express their support for the heroic Palestinian resistance, raise the flag of Palestine and the banners of resistance. The Masar Badil has called on its organizations and supporters to organize popular, political and media demonstrations and events to expose the Zionist crimes against our people in occupied Palestine, and to support the AlAqsa Flood operation announced by the CommanderinChief of the Izz alDin alQassam Brigades the military wing of Hamas, Brother Mohammed alDeif. The statement says The heroic Palestinian resistance has opened a chapter of battles of dignity and pride at the dawn of October 7, 2023, and it is now responding to decades of continuous and repeated Zionist, U.S. and European aggression against the masses of our Arab and Islamic nation. For its part, Hamas stated this operation, called AlAqsa Flood was launched on October 7 with more than 7,000 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance movement also said its fighters have joined the operation as Hamas called on Palestinians everywhere to fight and on resistance groups in Lebanon to join the fighting against Israel. Israel responded with massive air strikes deep inside Gaza, killing scores and wounding hundreds of people and vowing unprecedented retaliation.Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. We are in a war and we will win it. He told everyone in Gaza to evacuate or face the consequences of Israeli strikes, despite the fact that Gaza is an area of about 365 square km, and home to 2.3 million Palestinians, which has been under an Israeli occupation and blockade since 2007, meaning that the people have no where to go. Palestinians inspect the ruins of mosques and homes following Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City, October 9, 2023. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed and at least 123,500 have been displaced by Israeli bombings as of October 9. Crowds gather on October 9, 2023, for the funeral of 15yearold Imad Jareh Adili, shot the night before by Israeli colonial forces at the entrance of Beita, south of Nablus. These forces have killed at least 11 Palestinians in the West Bank at demonstrations in support of resistance in Gaza and in confrontations with the army. Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on October 7 I have signed an order instructing Israel Electric Company to stop the electricity supply to Gaza. Power outages have long been an everyday occurrence in Gaza and households only had electricity for several hours a day on a rotational basis on the days before recent power cuts started. Gazas power authority informed that 80 per cent of the electricity supplies to Gaza from the national grid were cut off following Israels announcement. As of October 9, the UN informs that the Gaza Power Plant is now the only source of power and could run out of fuel within days. The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel, UN Human Rights Commission in its recent report September 2023 concluded that Israel has violated and continues to violate the right of the Palestinian people to selfdetermination by its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. The legal consequence of the violation of right to selfdetermination, which is an obligation erga omnes toward all, is the responsibility of the State of Israel. The current occupation, which has lasted 56 years to date, is unlawful under international law. The result of the unlawful acts entails legal consequences for Israel to bring an end to the internationally wrongful act. All States and the UN are also under an obligation to act urgently to bring the unlawful acts to an end. Palestinian children fill water bottles after Israeli colonial forces announce a complete siege cutting off food, water, fuel and electricity, October 9, 2023. As of October 9, the death toll of Palestinians has risen to 687 people, including 140 children and over 2,900 injured. At least 900 Israelis have been killed and over 2,616 wounded. The United Nations says 123,538 Palestinians have been displaced by fighting. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees estimates that 73,538 people are sheltering across 64 schools in Gaza, some of which are designated emergency shelters. Meanwhile, 130 Israelis are reportedly being held captive and approximately 750 Israelis are currently missing, according to Israeli media. The U.S. said that nine U.S. citizens have died during ongoing hostilities in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israel has now initiated Operation Swords of Iron which it says is directed against Hamas but in fact targets the entire population of Gaza. Israel has amassed a force 300,000 strong and an all out Israeli ground attack on the Gaza Strip is expected. Israels Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a complete siege of the Gaza Strip on October 9. I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed, Gallant said. On the morning of October 10, the Israeli military said its air force had dropped 2,000 munitions and more than 1,000 tonnes of bombs on Gaza in the last 20 hours. It has shelled 20 highrise residential buildings, mosques, hospitals, banks and other civilian infrastructure, news agencies report. Despite the large number of civilian buildings struck, the Israeli military claims it has destroyed 800 military targets in Gaza as part of its bombing campaign. Gallant said, We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly. Salama Marouf, head of media for the Hamas government of Gaza, said Gallants statement was cover to justify the occupations aggression against civilian people and property. UN observers concur. Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza have targeted houses and apartment buildings, with some struck without warning for residents to evacuate, the UN said on October 9. One Israeli airstrike in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, for example, killed 19 members of the same family. Conducting airstrikes against civilian targets without warning has become Israels new normal. The execution of Israeli hostages will be the response to the Israeli forces attacks on residential buildings and civilian facilities, Hamas said in a statement. Intense clashes are also reported as the resistance fighters engage Israeli troops in several cities across the occupied West Bank, including clashes in Jenin, Nablus, Jericho, and Hebron. Palestinian media reports more than 300 acts of resistance in the West Bank since Hamas began its operation, including several shootings targeting Israeli troops. The Jalameh checkpoint was set ablaze by Palestinian fighters on October 8. Confrontations with Israeli forces were reported in the town of alIssawiya, northeast of occupied Jerusalem and in Wadi alJooz, Ras alAmoud, and alThawri neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. International Response U.S. President Joe Biden has ordered the largest U.S. aircraft carrier and warplanes to move closer to Israel in a show of support for Israels war against the Palestinian people. The U.S. also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on October 9. Israel has also requested the Biden administration provide it additional Iron Dome missile interceptors, small diameter bombs, and machine gun ammunition. For his part, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that Britain unequivocally stands with Israel and has offered potential military aid. He also posted a picture of Downing Street to social media, with the Israeli flag projected on it with the caption We Stand with Israel. Another was projected on Londons City Hall. Lebanons Hezbollah resistance movement says it has fired shells and guided missiles toward Israelioccupied Lebanese territories, in response to Israeli bombardment of its installations. Hezbollah said it had targeted the Radar, Zabdin, and Ruwaysat AlAlam sites in the Israelioccupied Shebaa Farms. The attacks were carried out on the path to liberate what remains occupied of our Lebanese land and in solidarity with the victorious Palestinian resistance, the struggling and patient Palestinian people, Hezbollah said. Qatar is holding negotiations between Palestinian organizations and Israel for a possible deal on a prisoner swap. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation OIC has condemned Israels ongoing military aggression against the people in Palestine, stressing that the main cause of the latest bloody conflict is the regimes disregard for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. The OIC said the continuation of the Israeli occupation and its failure to adhere to the resolutions of international legitimacy, and the escalation of the pace of its attacks and daily crimes against the Palestinian people, their land and holy sites, and depriving them of their legitimate rights is the main reason for instability. Irans mission to the United Nations says Operation AlAqsa Storm is a legitimate defence against decades of Israeli occupation. It rejected allegations that Tehran had a role in Hamas largescale military operation. It has been taken solely by Palestine itself, the mission said. The resolute measures taken by Palestine constitute a wholly legitimate defence against seven decades of oppressive occupation and heinous crimes committed by the illegitimate Zionist regime, the mission said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba issued a statement on October 8 which said The Republic of Cuba expresses grave concern over the escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine, which is the result of 75 years of continuous violation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and Israels aggressive and expansionist policy. Cuba demands a broad, fair and lasting solution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, on the basis of the creation of two states, which enables the Palestinian people to exercise their right to free determination and to possess an independent and sovereign state within the borders prior to 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The United Nations Security Council must fulfill its mandate and put an end to the impunity of Israel, the occupying power, of which the United States has historically been accomplice, by repeatedly obstructing the bodys action, undermining peace, security and stability in the Middle East. Cuba calls for peace and the search for a solution through negotiation that avoids a further escalation of conflict that has already cost the lives of tens of thousands of people. Indonesia and Pakistan also expressed support for the Palestinians. They called on Israel to immediately halt its brutal aggression against Palestinians. Indonesia is deeply concerned with the escalation of conflict between Palestine and Israel. Indonesia urges the immediate end of violence to avoid further human casualties, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The root of conflict, namely the occupation of the Palestinian territories by Israel, must be resolved, in accordance with the parameters agreed upon by the UN, the statement said. This came after the Indonesia Hospital, located in the northern Gaza Strip city of Beit Lahia, was hit by Israeli forces on Saturday killing one of the facilitys local staff. Indonesian nongovernmental organization Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, or MERC, which funded the hospital, has vociferously condemned the attack. The direct attack on the Indonesia Hospital complex in Beit Lahia, Gaza Strip on Saturday appears to amplify how in the IsraelPalestine war, international humanitarian law is never under consideration for Israel, the committee said in a statement. Pakistans President Dr. Arif Alvi criticized Israel for suppressing the rights of Palestinians, urging the international community to play its active role to ease the tension between Israel and Palestine. Progress toward peace cannot materialize without condemnation of usurpation and brutalization of Palestinian rights and people by Israel, Alvi wrote A viable and sovereign State of Palestine must be established on the basis of pre1967 borders and UN resolutions. The international community needs to intervene to bring an end to the conflict, protect civilians, and work towards a lasting peace in the Middle East, he added. Riyad H. Mansour the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations urged the international community not to let Israel double down on its terrible choices, but to instead encourage it to change course and remind it that there is a path to peace, where neither Palestinians nor Israelis are killed. And it is the one diametrically opposed to the one Israel has embarked on. History for some media and politicians starts when Israelis are killed, he said, adding that Our people have endured one deadly year after another. ... Where is the international protection the Palestinian people are entitled to when the occupying power violates international law and harms those it is obliged to protect Arent Palestinian lives worth saving The Palestinian civilians killed, the Palestinian children killed in occupied Palestine, could have been spared. Isnt that a moral and legal obligation and a contribution to peace Why nothing is done when those killed are Palestinians We need to think hard of what logic we want to see prevail here. If this is about vengeance, then many Palestinians will feel they have much to avenge. If this is about peace, then the way to it is not through further entrenching oppression and occupation but by ending it. You cannot say nothing justifies killing Israelis and then provide justifications for killing Palestinians. We are not subhumans. We will never accept a rhetoric that denigrates our humanity and reneges our rights, a rhetoric that ignores the occupation of our land and oppression of our people. Mansour urged the international community to consider a different path, one that prioritizes the lives and rights of the Palestinian people. He called for equal measures of freedom and security, emphasizing that standing up against occupation is not just the right thing to do morally, but also legally and politically. Last October, we stated before the Security Council The Palestinian people will be free, one day or the other, one way or another. We chose the peaceful way, the one the international community advocates for. Do not let Israel prove us wrong, for our sake and theirs, said Mansour. When Israel now tries to justify yet another assault by the same faulty premise, no one should say or do anything to encourage it down this path. We know only too well that the messages about Israels right to defend itself will be interpreted by Israel as license to kill, to pursue on the very path that led us here. The UN Security Council met on October 8 to discuss the developments but was unable to issue a statement as no agreement could be reached. Statements As Israeli colonial violence escalates in Gaza, Labour for PalestineCanada demands that the Canadian government call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the Israeli occupation and apartheid in Palestine. We offer our condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in recent days, and throughout the decades of forcible dispossession and occupation, no matter where they live. It is a heartbreaking truth that the daily violence and terror experienced by the Palestinians, at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces and with the support of the international community, requires relentless and sustained resistance. A population cannot live under siege and apartheid with the daily threat of harassment, humiliation, violence, home demolitions and murder without responding. The UN claims 2023 has already been the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started counting deaths in 2006. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of this year, according to the health ministry. Western world leaders, including Canada, have shamefully turned a blind eye as far right Israeli ministers publicly provoke violence, as land grabbing became official government policy, and unspeakable war crimes are a regular occurrence. After more than 16 years of living under economic and military siege by Israel, of being confined to the worlds largest open airprison, Gaza has finally broken free and Palestinians are demonstrating their determination to liberate themselves and their land from 75 years of settlercolonization, apartheid and occupation. The current Palestinian violence must be understood within the context that it is taking place in order for genuine peace and justice to be realized. Now, after such prolonged and shameful silence, Canada and its political parties have jumped to condemn Palestinians for resisting their own annihilation. Yet they refuse to even mention that Israel, a military superpower, has now declared war on Palestinians for daring to resist. As members of the labour movement in Canada, we call for an end to the Israeli occupation and apartheid in Palestine. We further call on the Canadian Government to recognize and condemn the incessant violence perpetrated and provoked by Israel. We commend Palestinians for their heroic resistance and their indomitable will. We recognize the right of all people to resist their own occupation, including through armed struggle. This right, first protected by the Geneva Conventions in 1949, has been reaffirmed numerous times by the United Nations general assembly. We refuse to be divided or to fall into the colonial trap of condemning certain Palestinian groups or certain forms of resistance. Canadians should not attempt to dictate how an oppressed indigenous population fights for their own liberation. We call on all trade unions and labour leaders to be in solidarity with Palestinian resistance by educating their members, pressuring politicians, and championing boycott, divestment, and sanctions against apartheid Israel. The labour movement must use its power and influence to end Canadas support for Israels racist colonial regime. We encourage trade unionists to contact Labour for Palestine for resources and support towards that end. The Association of Palestinian Arab Canadians APAC is deeply concerned with the ongoing violence in Palestine and Israel and stands in solidarity with all Palestinians in advocating for their human rights. We condemn statements reaffirming Israels right to defend itself and view statements of this nature as onesided and irresponsible. Such statements perpetuate an ongoing and harmful pattern of complete disregard to the core issues that have created the conditions which led to this violence. APAC affirms that the death of civilians is never acceptable. However, the violence we are seeing today is sadly what Palestinians experience on a daily basis, whether it be through Israels crushing illegal blockade of Gaza, persistent settler attacks on Palestinian civilians, or Israels illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. Todays violence is a reminder of the consequences of a 75 year long unchecked occupation, continued expansion of illegal settlements, continued denial of Palestinians fundamental human rights, a brutal blockade, and an unrelenting system of apartheid. In the immediate term, we call on the Government of Canada, in partnership with the international community, to exercise all diplomatic efforts to deescalate the situation demand that Israel exercise restraint and remind Israel of its legal duties under international law as an occupying power to protect those living under its brutal occupation. Furthermore, we call on the Government of Canada to refrain from issuing provocative statements affirming Israels unequivocal right to defend itself. Courage is required to recognize that the international communitys pattern of reaffirming Israels right to defend itself has not contributed to improving the prospects for peace and only serves to provide Israel with the diplomatic cover to undertake heinous acts of violence against the Palestinian people. Lastly, we call on the Government of Canada, in partnership with the international community, to make resolving the IsraelPalestine issue a top international priority. Peace in the region remains elusive in part due to the international communitys refusal to make sincere efforts to address root causes and its failure to hold Israel accountable for its flagrant violation of international law. A solution can only be achieved with the full participation of the Palestinian people and through the upholding and equal application of international law and an end to the occupation. In the absence of this, we will remain trapped in this ongoing cycle of violence as the desire for freedom, and efforts to resist the denial of this freedom, should never be underestimated. On October 7, the Communist Party of Israel CPI and the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality Hadash courageously and truthfully put the full responsibility for the escalation of violence in the Israeli war against the Palestinians on the Netanyahu government. In a statement concerning the rapid escalation of military confrontation between Hamas and Israeli forces, they blame the criminal occupation policy of the Netanyahu government, underlining the grave dangers that it poses for the peace in the region. The fascist rightwing governments crimes to perpetuate the occupation are leading to a regional war that must be stopped. Even in difficult days like this we repeat and voice an unequivocal condemnation of any harm to innocent civilians, and call for their removal from the bloodshed. We send our condolences to all the families of the victims of the occupation, Arabs and Jews alike, the statement reads. CPI and Hadash put the full responsibility on the fascist rightwing government for the sharp and dangerous escalation of the last few hours, that cost the lives of many innocent citizens. At the end of a shocking week in which the settlers ran amok throughout the occupied territories under the auspices of their government, desecrated the AlAqsa Mosque and carried out another pogrom in Huwara, we woke up this morning to a very serious escalation, which endangers the entire region in a regional and dangerous war which the rightwing government has been fueling since its first day. Todays events show in what dangerous direction the Netanyahu government and the settlers are leading the entire region, and emphasize once again that there is no way to manage the conflict or resolve it militarily there is only one solution strive to end the occupation and recognize the legitimate demands and rights of the Palestinian people. The end of the occupation and the establishment of a just peace are a distinct and common interest of the two peoples in this country. CPI and Hadash express deep concern about the use of recent developments by the Netanyahu government to carry out a vengeful attack on the Gaza Strip and call on the international community and the countries of the region to intervene immediately to silence the drums of war and initiate moves that will lead to the promotion of a political solution. CPI and Hadash warn of revenge activities against the ArabPalestinian citizens of Israel, and especially the residents of the mixed cities and the unknown villages in the Negev who have already paid a high price due to the neglect of their lives by the state and the lack of infrastructure in the settlements. In this reality, it is the duty of the sane forces in Israel, Jews and Arabs alike, to raise a sharp and clear voice against any attempt to incite against entire populations or to take the law into ones own hands, and to promote joint activity, which signifies the aspiration for a normative life without occupation, discrimination and supremacy a life of peace, equality and true democracy for all. Saturday evening October 7, Member of the Knesset Ofer Cassif Hadash posted a video to social media Nothing justifies crimes and massacres as committed today in the south of Israel. But the writing was on the wall, as I warned for a long time We will pay a heavy price for the crimes of the occupation, the siege on Gaza and the arrogance of the racist Kahanist government. There is no military solution, only a political one the end of the occupation and Palestinian independence. On October 4, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights PCHR delivered an oral intervention during the 54th regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council UNHRC. The statement was delivered by Basel Alsourani, PCHRs International Advocacy Officer, under Agenda item 7 on Human Rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab Territories. It addressed Israeli apartheid, focusing on the statements made by Israeli National Security Minister, Itamar BenGvir, during a TV interview in which he publicly admitted to Israeli apartheid. During the interview, Itamar BenGvir stated that Israeli rights were more important than those of Palestinians, a statement which he refused to apologize for. The text of the oral statement continues Itamar Ben Gvirs statements reflect the enduring reality in the Occupied Palestinian Territory OPT and inside the Green Line as the Israeli government continues to impose a system of domination and oppression against Palestinians denying them their most basic rights, including their right to selfdetermination, in order to benefit Israeli Jews. This is not the first time that an Israeli minister has made such a statement. Several months earlier, Israeli Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, called for the wiping out of the Palestinian town of Howara. The existence of apartheid has become increasingly difficult to ignore considering the Israeli government policies, statements, and practices which clearly show an intent to pursue permanent annexation of Palestinian land based on Jewish supremacy. In addition, there has been growing recognition among Palestinian, Israeli, and International human rights organizations as well as experts, academics, and prominent individuals that the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as well as inside the Green Line amounts to apartheid. At the end of the statement, PCHR called on Member States of the UNHRC to recognize, condemn, and dismantle Israels apartheid system. PCHR also called on the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to include the crime against humanity of apartheid in his investigation into the situation and prosecute relevant perpetrators. On September 27, members of the Security Council received a brief of the UN SecretaryGeneral on the implementation of Security Council resolution 2334 2016 for the reporting period from June 15 to September 19 of this year. Security Council resolution 2334 2016 calls on Israel to immediately and completely cease all settlement activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and to fully respect all of its legal obligations in this regard. Settlement activity has, nevertheless, continued. Israeli authorities advanced plans for 6,300 housing units in Area C, including the retroactive legalization, under Israeli law, of three outposts near the settlement of Eli. In East Jerusalem, approximately 3,580 housing units were advanced. ... I remain deeply troubled by the unrelenting expansion of Israeli settlements and settlement outposts in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, with over 10,000 housing units advanced in this reporting period alone. Settlements further entrench the occupation, fuel violence, impede Palestinian access to their land and resources, and systematically erode the viability of a Palestinian State as part of a twoState solution. I reiterate that settlements have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law and United Nations resolutions. I call on the Government of Israel to cease all settlement activity and dismantle outposts immediately, in line with its obligations under international law. Demolitions and seizures of Palestinianowned structures continued across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Citing the lack of Israeliissued building permits, which are almost impossible for Palestinians to obtain, Israeli authorities, demolished, seized or forced people to demolish 238 structures, displacing 183 people, including 46 women and 91 children and 32 structures which were donor funded. Fiftynine schools, serving some 6,500 Palestinian students, are at risk of demolition. The demolition and seizure of Palestinian structures, including internationally funded humanitarian projects, entail numerous human rights violations and raise concerns about the risk of forcible transfer. I call upon the Government of Israel to end this practice, in line with its international obligations, and to allow Palestinian communities to build and address their development needs, the UN Secretary General said. The report further recorded the following Over the reporting period, 68 Palestinians, including 18 children, were killed by Israeli security forces during demonstrations, clashes, security operations, attacks or alleged attacks against Israelis, and other incidents. 2,830 Palestinians, including 30 women and 559 children, were injured. Of that number, 271 were injured by live ammunition and 2,119 by tear gas inhalation. In addition, two Palestinians were killed and 73 injured, including three women and 12 children, amid a high level of attacks by Israeli settlers. Israeli security forces carried out 1,042 searchandarrest operations in the West Bank, resulting in 1,504 Palestinians arrested, including 88 children. Israel currently holds 1,264 Palestinians in administrative detention, the highest number in over a decade. Security Council resolution 2334 2016 calls for the parties to refrain from acts of provocation, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric. Unfortunately, such acts continued. In an interview, an Israeli Minister said, My right and that of my wife and my children, to travel on the roads in Judea and Samaria, is more important than the freedom of movement for Arabs. A Member of the Israeli Knesset said that any Palestinian running away from an Israel Defense Forces soldier must be shot. A Palestinian who approaches an IDF soldier must also be shot, he added. An Israeli minister visited the Holy Sites on the Jewish commemoration day of Tisha Bav and called on Israelis to return to the sites and show our governance. The SecretaryGeneral called on Israel to abide by its obligations under international law, including with regard to the proportional use of force, and ensure thorough, independent and prompt investigations into all instances of possible excessive use of force, holding those responsible to account. ... I am disturbed by the multiple instances in which officials have used dangerous or racist rhetoric and engaged in incitement. The SecretaryGeneral said that he continues to remain committed to supporting Palestinians and Israelis to end the occupation and resolve the conflict in line with international law, relevant United Nations resolutions, and bilateral agreements in pursuit of the vision of two States Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous, viable, and sovereign Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security within secure and recognized borders, on the basis of the pre1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the shared capital of both States. For 30 years now, Israel has shown it has no intention of abiding by its obligations under international law and that the twostate solution was never its intention. The Palestinian people are courageously seeking an end to the occupation, the apartheid regime and the crimes of genocide committed against them. Photo Review Ottawa, October 8 With less than a days notice, more than 1,200 people, most of them young people, gathered at the Human Rights Monument in Ottawa to show their support for the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance. Speakers there included the Palestinian Youth Movement, Independent Jewish Voices, Palestinian Student Association University of Ottawa, and Labour for Palestine Canada. All the speakers called for support for the Palestinian people against the aggression and armed violence of the Zionist entity. They saluted the Palestinian resistance which has opened a chapter of struggle for the dignity and pride of the Palestinian people which is now responding to decades of continuous and repeated Zionist aggression against the Palestinian people. They denounced the hypocrisy of the Trudeau government and all political parties who support Israels right to defend itself while ignoring the plight of the Palestinian people caused by the Zionists criminality. They also cautioned everyone not to fall into the trap of condemning the victims of oppression and dictating how the Palestinian people should fight for their liberation. After hearing the speakers, the demonstration marched through downtown Ottawa and the Byward Market, past the U.S. Embassy and Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus office on Wellington Street. Slogans shouted called for the freedom of Palestine and affirmed that resistance is a right. The demonstration ended at the Human Rights Monument more than two hours after the rally began, with calls from the organizers to be ready to demonstrate again and continue actions in support of the Palestinian people. Montreal, October 8 At the call of the Palestinian Youth Movement, hundreds of people of all ages, most of them youth, rallied at Dorchester Square in downtown Montreal where a sea of Palestinian flags adorned the park. For close to an hour, people chanted in unison in French, English and Arabic From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free Free, Free Palestine Netanyahu, You Will See, Palestine Will Be Free Gaza, Gaza Resistance is Justified, When People are Occupied,Resistance Is Justified When People are Colonized Intifada, Intifada, Long Live Intifada There Is Only One Solution, Intifada Revolution Israel Terrorist, Trudeau Accomplice A young woman spoke to the crowd reminding everyone that People in Palestine have been under a blockade for more than 50 years. Under the brutality of the occupation, people have been denied their basic rights. The crowd answered back Shame She added, The arrogance of the occupiers, believing they can get away with anything because they have the backing of some of the most powerful countries in the world, ... The operations that have been going on for the last few days are to restore our dignity, and for all the Arabs of the world. We are here to celebrate that victory, .. to break that captivity that has been imposed on us by the Zionist entity ... to restore our rightful honour ... We are asking politicians to support us and to remind them that we are here to liberate our homeland, with our own hands. As members of the diaspora that live in Canada, in the heart of the enemy, we must remind ourselves to be patient, that wherever we go, we must not rest until every inch of Palestine is liberated For close to two hours the march travelled through the streets of downtown Montreal, with people chanting slogans and waving flags until they arrived at the Israeli consulate. The consulate was heavily guarded by police officers of the Sret du Qubec riot squad who pushed back anyone trying to go up the stairs leading to the entrance of the building. The crowd stayed on for another half hour. The organizers called on people to be ready to come out for another emergency rally when needed. Halifax, October 8 Toronto, October 7 For several hours, a group of Palestinian youth and supporters of the Palestinian resistance waved flags and hung a large banner stating Honk Your Horns for Palestine on an overpass straddling the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto. The honking of the horns was practically uninterrupted as motorists coming into and leaving the city showed their support, some waving and raising their fists. This support invigorated the youth who held their ground despite the efforts of the Toronto police to harass and intimidate them, and clearly reflected the broad support for the Palestinian peoples courage and their just cause. Toronto, October 9 More than 5,000 people participated in a rally and march in support of the Palestinian people organized by the Palestine Youth Movement. The action began at Nathan Phillips Square with the chanting of slogans including From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free Trudeau You Will See, Palestine Will Be Free The Only Solution, Intifada Revolution Intifada, Intifada, Long Live the Intifada, and others in Arabic and English. Following the rally, the participants marched up Bay Street stopping at intersections to chant and shout slogans. Along the route youth were front and centre along the way and leading the chants. Many Torontonians warmly saluted the action, many joining in. The action ended at the Israeli Consulate at Yonge and Bloor Street where the chanting of slogans continued for some time reflecting the spirit of the Palestinian people to continue their struggle until victory. Many denounced the statements of politicians like Ontario Premier Doug Ford and the mayor of Toronto, Olivia Chow, who outdid themselves in characterizing the actions called in solidarity with Palestine as glorifying this weekends indiscriminate violence. Chow tweeted that The rally to support Hamas at Nathan Phillips Square today is unsanctioned, without a permit and I unequivocally denounce it. Glorifying this weekends indiscriminate violence, including murder and kidnapping of women and children, by Hamas against Israeli civilians is deplorable. She remained silent about the crimes of the Zionists against women and children and the entire Palestinian people, all against international law including cutting electricity and shipments of food and water and medical supplies to Gaza and standards of human behaviour. Chow ended her statement with I am receiving updates from the Chief of Police, who assures me they will investigate and address any suspected incidents of hate. The spirit of the rally in Toronto was unequivocally in support of the unwavering determination of the Palestinian people to end the Israeli occupation and their treatment as less than human, with no rights. It applauded the Palestinian resistance for defying the constant repression and violence and the stand of the Zionists and their supporters that they are all powerful and can succeed in subduing the longsuffering Palestinian nation. London, October 9 Edmonton, October 8 Around 1,500 Palestinians and their supports held a militant rally in Castle Downs Park. Large numbers of youth participated, along with whole families, from the small children holding Palestinian flags to the older generation who hold the memories of being forced from their homes when they themselves were small children. A huge Palestinian flag covered the hillside where everyone gathered to hear the speakers. Speaker after speaker upheld the right of the people of Palestine and all oppressed people to resist. They spoke of the crimes committed by the Zionists, and their determination to End the Occupation. Again and again the speakers were met with Free Palestine From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free and other chants. Following the speakers everyone joined in to hold a militant march through the park.

By Benjamin Bouchard, Universit Laval Daniel Nadeau, Universit Laval, and Florent Domine, Universit Laval For more than six months a year, Quebecs boreal forest is covered in a thick blanket of snow. While this is essential for the balance of our ecosystems, for the people living downstream from forested watersheds the snow can be like a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. The major floods of spring 2023 in the Charlevoix region show why the snow cover poses a risk. Last winter, the Rivire du Gouffre watershed, of which nearly 75 per cent is covered by forests, accumulated a large amount of snow. The melting of this snow cover combined with an extremely intense rainfall event helped push the river out of its bed, causing unprecedented flooding in BaieSaintPaul. As part of my PhD at Universit Laval, in collaboration with Sentinel North, I am looking at the impact of snow cover properties on watershed hydrology in the boreal forest. Rain as an energy carrier As we saw in the spring of 2023, rain events combined with snow cover can lead to a sudden rise in river water levels. One reason for this is that rainwater transfers heat to the snow.|0

La facture sera vraisemblablement de plusieurs centaines de milliers de dollars, estime le maire. Claude Mayrand, maire de SaintMathieuduParc. Sylvain MayerLe Nouvelliste On est en tat durgence depuis dimanche matin. Le gouvernement est avis. Pour les frais, le gouvernement va nous aider. Les contacts ont t faits avec le dput. On va crer un fonds particulier. Le ponceau du chemin du lac Jackson, malgr son diamtre de huit pieds, na pu rsister la force de leau. Le portrait est comparable au chemin de la Coureuse.

Lorsque la rivire va monter, leau saccumulera dans le bassin plutt que dans la cour des citoyens comme on la vcu en fin de semaine. Cest une solution propose et lon va ltudier. Le maire ne manque pas de remercier toute lquipe qui a travaill pied duvre en ce long weekend de cong afin dassurer la scurit de tous les citoyens. Je pense aux travaux publics et nos pompiers volontaires qui nont pas hsit rpondre prsents.

Intense rain frequently causes flooding at about a dozen properties bordering the waterway. For David Winter, who has lived on one of the properties for more than 30 years, its a recurring nightmare. Probably six or seven times during that period Ive experienced considerable flooding to my property and my home, he told CBC News in a recent interview. David Winter says Rennies River has flooded his home and property after a heavy rainfall many times. Mark QuinnCBC More than a decade ago, the City of St. Johns hired consultants to study the issue. In its 2014 report, engineering and environmental design firm CBCL Limited documented flooding in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2012. Flooding happened again in September 2022 after posttropical storm Earl dropped more than 175 millimetres of rain on St. Johns. Residents have told CBC News they believe development upstream has increased the frequency and severity of flooding downstream. They blame subdivisions and malls that paved over wetlands that used to absorb water upstream for example, Winter said, removing bogs and marshes upstream, along Learys Brook, and allowing the storm water to flow from the infrastructure that has been built along the waterway, such as the university, the health sciences complex, to flow directly into the river and not being retained by the bogs that used to control the flow into the river itself. Some residents have also said its been compounded by heavier storms caused by climate change. After receiving the consultants report the city proposed a 5million plan to build a concrete structure, called a weir, at the outlet of Long Pond. The weir, a sort of dam, is designed to regulate the release of water from the pond and prevent flooding downstream. St. Johns Mayor Danny Breen supports the proposal. My opinion and councils opinion is that the weir is important a critical part of flood mitigation downstream and we are anxious to get it approved so we can begin construction, said Breen. St. Johns Mayor Danny Breen wants construction of the floodmitigation weir to begin as soon as possible. Mark QuinnCBC The citys plan was released to proceed by the provincial Department of Environment and Climate Change in May 2022 but the decision was conditional on the project receiving approval from the Pippy Park Commission. The commission has so far refused to approve the plan, which would see the flood mitigation structure built within the parks boundaries. WATCH Whats holding up a floodmitigation plan for Rennies River Why a flood prevention plan for Rennies River is jammed up Duration 236 Featured Video People who live near Rennies River in St. Johns say theyve waited long enough. A 5million project to prevent flooding on their properties was greenlighted by the provincial government last year. The CBCs Mark Quinn asks why its still on hold. Walking trails around Long Pond are already damaged by occasional flooding. The commission believes the weir will make matters worse, says chair Sean Kelly. Its going to increase the amount of water in the pond beyond even some of the largest floods that we have had. So well have more flooding and more damage all the way along, said Kelly. Sean Kelly, chair of the Pippy Park Commission, says the commission doesnt believe the proposed weir will work. Mark QuinnCBC Talks among the province, St. Johns and the Pippy Park Commission are ongoing, but Kelly says the commission doesnt believe the weir will even fix the problem it aims to address. Were prepared to work with the city to find a way to stop flooding downstream but we just dont think that as it stands this is the solution to that, said Kelly.|1

She said the importance of catastrophe insurance for countries in natural disaster corridors cannot be underestimated.|Extreme weather events brought on by an unfolding climate crisis are expected to trigger a significant reduction in insurance coverage for Jamaican homeowners, industry experts are warning. Already, major insurers in the United States, a main market for local insurance companies reinsurers, have announced their intent to cease writing coverage for some regions because of troubling weather patterns caused by climate change. The ripple effect will be an increase in premiums and deductibles for some homeowners while others are expected to be priced out of catastrophe insurance coverage. International reinsurers, the finance companies that cover risks taken on by local insurance companies, want more and are moving to other markets to do business where Jamaican insurance companies fail to increase coverage rates, The Gleaner reported months ago. Approximately 90 per cent of the premiums charged by local insurers on property is ceded to reinsurers and those funds are put in a pool to cover payout from a disaster. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. For several years, Sharon Donaldson, president of the Insurance Association of Jamaica, has said the Caribbean has experienced an increasing frequency in the number of natural disasters that have resulted in significant damage to properties. She said general insurance companies and reinsurers have funded these economic losses caused by natural disasters windstorms and earthquakes for many years. These pool funds are rapidly declining and have been said in some quarters to be at an alltime low. The result is catastrophe risk insurance is less available and more expensive, she told The Gleaner. Donaldson said 2023, even as it draws to a close, saw one of the most challenging renewal seasons for the entire region to include the Caribbean and North America. She said many reinsurers reduced capacity to the region while others withdrew entirely from the market. Given the continuing negative impact of climate change on the frequency of natural disasters, I dont think the reinsurance capacity for the upcoming year will improve. I believe that commercial businesses will continue to purchase insurance, but homeowners may find the price a tad too steep and opt to selfinsure, Donaldson theorised. Will the average homeowner be able to afford catastrophe insurance as a predisaster risk management mechanism in the near future Probably not, she added, noting that postdisaster may be burdensome on the community, the economy, and the family. Donaldson said that without catastrophe insurance, the recovery process would become even more challenging, which would produce a drag on economic recovery. She said the importance of catastrophe insurance for countries in natural disaster corridors cannot be underestimated. I suspect business owners and homeowners will continue to face difficult choices on insurance spend, said Donaldson. The 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season produced 14 named storms winds of 39mph or greater, of which eight became hurricanes winds of 74mph or greater and two intensified to major hurricanes with winds reaching 111mph or greater, according to the Washington, D.C.based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA. The NOAA is a scientific and regulatory agency. The 2021 season saw 21 storms, ranking as the thirdbusiest Atlantic season on record, behind 2020s unprecedented 30 named storms, and the 27 named storms and one unnamed storm that developed in 2005. I dont think people understand the extent to which property insurance underpins all formal commercial activity, environmentalist Diana McCaulay noted. McCaulay, whose background is also rooted in general insurance, said given the current climate crisis that is unfolding in several kinds of hazards windstorms, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding, wildfires it is not surprising that insurance is becoming more expensive and less available in regions of the world that are particularly subject to these hazards. Yet as I look around Jamaica, we continue to build as if we are still in the climate of the past. Will we be able to buy property insurance for hotels on the coast in the near future Will our people be able to withstand the heat, which is made worse by all the concrete and hard structures we are laying down I dont know, but this summer is a true wakeup call for what lies ahead, she said. Beachfront properties and others closer to the sea are considered a problematic type of risk, Managing Director of BCIC Jamaica Peter Levy told The Gleaner, noting that they carry a 50 per cent higher rate. Still, the company has not seen a falloff in its portfolio and has seen a commensurate movement with respect to coverage for floodprone or lowlying areas that would run on average 25 per cent higher in terms of premium. I think thats partly because of climate change. Sea level rise is the expected outcome of climate change that a lot of people are aware of whereas changing rain patterns and flood frequencies is not something that has received the same amount of public attention. So I would say its the coastal risks rather than the floodprone risks that have seen reductions in appetite from the insurance market. I would also say at the same time, though, that we havent seen people opting out of the insurance market. In fact, weve seen a higherthannormal level in increases of value, he said. kimone.francisgleanerjm.com|1

Additionally, VFRS will also be receiving fire suppression equipment up to 80,000, specifically made for electric vehicle EV fires. Its a blanket that is pulled over the vehicle to help contain the heat and the gas from the fire, said fire chief David Lind. And the other tool we need actually hooks up to water. We place it under the vehicle and we lift it up into the area where the battery boxes are located and then flood that area with water. Lind mentioned how fires from EVs use a considerable amount of water, more so than a gas vehicle fire. With a gas vehicle, we can essentially just use water from our fire truck reservoir, not even needing a hydrant, Lind added. A tethered heavy duty drone, made to reach distances as high at 200 feet, was also accepted by council, for use by VFRS. The drone would be able to be flown into controlled airspaces during emergencies, like the recent McDougall Creek Wildfire. This specific drone is in use at other emergency services communities, Lind explained. The heavy price tag, up to 50,000 was initially questioned by Coun. Kelly Fehr, before the explanation by Lind. All funds for VFS will be discussed at the 2024 budget deliberations. Cannabis smell update After a resident brought forth a petition demanding enforcement of the cannabis odour control act at the previous council meeting, council has seemingly listened. The company, Avant Ventures has seen 44 complaints levied their way by Bylaw Compliance. However, Health Canada is responsible for action upon these complaints and since its federally regulated, there has not been any changes. Council approved a new motion, to write a letter to Health Canada requesting that they expedite the review of Avant Ventures, to be looked at at the next council meeting. I think we also send them Health Canada the number of complaints to them and continue to write them letters until the issue is dealt with, said Coun. Kari Gares. Our hands are tied, said Coun. Brian Quiring. We can do our best to work with the business owner but we cant force compliance and Health Canada has a responsibility. It should happen sooner rather than later, as the residents are being impacted. The letter will also be distributed to MP Mel Arnold. Roster Sports Club upgrade An application to increase the occupancy load at Rosters Sports Club, from 95 to 140 patrons, was approved without any discussion. Two residents who lived near the club submitted emails expressing concern for the proposal, out of the 136 property owners who were contacted. Roster believes that the structural change is not anticipated to have it be operated in a manner that is contrary to its primary purpose of a sports club. Funds for Carnival and OKeefe Grant funding requests from both the Vernon Winter Carnival and OKeefe Ranch Interior Heritage Society were both accepted by council. Carnival is seeking 10,000 in what is a continuation of funding, according to a city report. Since 2009, the City of Vernon has provided the VWC a grant in the amount of 10,000 to assist with its annual carnival. The grant is provided for annually in the budget, and for 2024, the tourism department has already agreed to be a sponsor for the society, and the city paid 10,000 for that sponsorship in August 2023. The request for 10,000 is in addition to the sponsorship amount and the funds have been included in the 2024 budget. Deliberations on the funds will be had in December when council dissects the upcoming budget. OKeefe is seeking 150,000. The city already annually includes 50,000 for the society, funded by taxation. Councils recommendation is to prepare a service level adjustment for the 2024 additional grant funds of 100,000 requested by the society. 3figure planning manager approved The reestablishment of a current planning manager within the planning and development team in the city was approved by council.

That might sound easier said than done, but there are some simple ways to avoid damage from freezing. Starting with the easiest, here are some preventative tips courtesy of Kevin Ukkonen from Bees Knees Plumbing, Heating and Electrical. Disconnect your garden hose from your outdoor faucet. Kevin explained why this simple step is so important. Theyre designed to shut the water off about 12 inches inside the home. if you leave the hose on, especially if its shut off, that water wont have an opportunity to drain out.

Theyre designed to shut the water off about 12 inches inside the home. if you leave the hose on, especially if its shut off, that water wont have an opportunity to drain out. Freezing and expanding can cause cracking that can potentially flood your house. During a cold snap, if youre just away for the day or if your furnace shuts down, it can help to leave a faucet on a bit. If you turn your water on to at least a trickle, the water will be less likely to freeze because its moving. He cautioned not to just turn your water on and not pay attention to it, but When it gets really cold, thats a good emergency measure. If youre going away for longer, the cheapest solution is to have someone check on your house daily. Kevin suggested Make sure they actually walk into the utility room and check things, look at the furnace, the water heater and where the water comes in. Dont set your temperature lower than 15C, especially if the weather might get to minus 20. Kevin explains that it might be 10 upstairs, but maybe downstairs its a few degrees cooler, and in a back corner where pipes might be, the temperature could get a lot closer to zero. Having someone come by isnt always an option, and some people go away for extended periods of time. Technology can let you keep tabs on things while youre not home. Kevin told us about some of the devices Bees Kneez electricians can install. Smart thermostat. If youre going to travel a lot, you can actually check the temperature of your house while youre gone.

The second phase of the project is already underway and will be completed by the end of the month. It involves an extension of the Mountview Dike by 60 meters and replacement of an undersized culvert under Mount McLean Dr. Construction on this 415,000 project is being undertaken by Gally Equipment Services and funds are coming from city reserves. The existing dike was built before this event and heightening and widening it will prevent future floods from impacting the Mountview neighbourhood like it did that year. The dike borders Sharpes Field and the eastern edge of James White Park, near the Mountview neighbourhood.|Higher, wider dike will prevent floods from impacting the Mountview neighbourhood like in 2013 The City of Fernie is currently working on a threephase project to make Mountview Dike more floodproof. The second phase of the project is already underway and will be completed by the end of the month. It involves an extension of the Mountview Dike by 60 meters and replacement of an undersized culvert under Mount McLean Dr. Construction on this 415,000 project is being undertaken by Gally Equipment Services and funds are coming from city reserves. The 700 millimeter culvert was undersized and didnt have enough capacity during some storms, which contributed to localized flooding at the edge of Max Turyk Community Centre. It is being replaced with a 1,800 millimeter diameter culvert. Phase three, which will be designed by McElhanney and financed by a Union of British Columbia Municipalities grant totaling 1,980,300, will be finished by next summer. The City awarded a design contract to McElhanney at a council meeting on Sept. 26 and construction will be tendered out next spring. It will see a portion of the dike altered to meet current standards. The dike will be raised approximately half a meter to the approved flood construction level, and the top will be widened and the sides altered where necessary to make a more gentle slope. A section of land at the junction of Elk River and Coal Creek will be strengthened to protect it from water erosion through a process known as armouring, which involves placing material, usually rocks, along the shoreline. Erosion that has occurred at the Coal Creek Bin Wall will be investigated. The bin wall is made of steel bins, which are filled with rocks and gravel and capped with cement. If the rocks and gravel are found to have eroded at the bottom, the wall will be repaired. The City initially hoped to complete the whole project using a 750,000 grant from the Union of British Columbia Municipalities that was allocated three years ago but this goal was not met and the project was instead divided into three phases, the first of which began 2020, when the dike was extended by 220metres. These projects were launched in response to the flood in June 2013. The existing dike was built before this event and heightening and widening it will prevent future floods from impacting the Mountview neighbourhood like it did that year. The dike borders Sharpes Field and the eastern edge of James White Park, near the Mountview neighbourhood. City of Fernie project engineer Joanna Line mentioned that the height of a dike is usually calculated by measuring the height of the worst flood that has affected a given area, while also accounting for local variation and debris. Flood Construction Level is typically the height of the 1 in 200 year flood event of that river, plus 10 per cent for future climate uncertainty and a 0.6 meters of freeboard, however, for areas where worse flood events have occurred, the flood construction level is calculated using the height of that flood event, plus the 10 per cent and freeboard, she explained in an email to The Free Press. In theory, there should be 0.6 meters of dry land between the top of the water and the top of the dike. Just think, if there are waves or large debris that is pulled from the banks of the river or creek upstream and get wedged or placed somewhere else downstream during a flood event, that could cause localized higher levels of water. Freeboard gives a margin of extra storage capacity, she added. gfrans15 newsroomthefreepress.ca Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.|1

The Flood Track Listing1.|Singersongwriter and guitarist Jeshua Marshall, of Larry and His Flask fame, recently released his sophomore solo album, The Flood, following on the heels of his 2021 debut album, Shoot The Moon. Marshall says, Music, for me, is medicine, therapy, and connection. Coproduced by Jeshua and Todd Rosenberg, The Flood features Jeshua Marshall vocals, guitar, Seth Acquarolo guitar, keyboards, Davey Hemm bass, Todd Rosenberg drums, Miguel Mendoza trumpet, and Wendi Wampler clarinet. Originally from Canada, Marshall grew up enveloped in religious orthodoxy yet was drawn toward secular music, especially the extreme ethos of pure punk. When he was 16 years old, he and his brother Jamin formed a punk band called Larry and His Flask, which later became famous for its reckless finesse. After touring nonstop, in 2019, Larry and His Flask came to an end, opening the door for Marshall to explore new sonic milieus. Encompassing ten tracks, The Flood begins with Water, a song written by Willy Tea Taylor about Knights Ferry, California. According to Marshall, Knights Ferry is a very special place to me, a home away from home. As a result, I fell in love with this song and learned it directly from Willy while I was touring through Scandinavia while playing bass for him in 2017. Water opens on a funky rhythm topped by tasty, bluesy guitars and blatting, sleazy horns. Marshalls evocative vocals imbue the lyrics with delicious tones. Entry points on the album include the reggaeflavored title track, with its skiffing guitars and onedrop beat. Braying brass gives the melody bright accents as well as a tropical feel. Unbound rolls out on a pushing, Americana rhythm as light, gleaming guitars suffuse the melody with creamy, shimmering colors. The feel and mood of the tune are upbeat and buoyant. Scrumptious, Spanishlace horns open Closed Doors, which segues into a driving countryrock melody brimming with wild energy and psychedelic whooshing inflections. Tinted with reggae hues, Swing blends big band energy with rollicking jazz aromas and wickedly sumptuous brass tones. The closing track, Wave, travels on sensuous blues textures, rolling on a captivating, swaying rhythm as Marshalls vocals imbue the lyrics with lush, alluring timbres. With its amalgamation of styles ranging from funk to reggae to Americana, The Flood reveals delicious wrinkles of aural flair. The Flood Track Listing 1. Water 2. The Flood 3.

You know, they straightened out the Mississippi River in places, she wrote. To make room for houses and livable acreage. Occasionally the river floods these places. Floods is the word they use, but in fact it is not flooding it is remembering. Remembering where it used to be. All water has a perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where it was.This sentiment of selfremembrance and interconnectedness alluded to in the very title of the record reverberates throughout Water Made Us , the first album from Chicagos Jamila Woods since 2019s LEGACY LEGACY . Confronted with her interiority during pandemic lockdown, Woods began a process of intensive selfreflection and spiritual discovery. This period of isolation during which she challenged herself to write as many songs as possible made her realize just how shaped she is by everyone outside of her. Having slowed down enough to patiently behold the patterns of her inner dialogue, she began writing in unprecedented quantities, headon, about the thing she realized she is always, in a sense, writing about love.In the densely poetic and sonically diverse result, she takes her time seventeen tracks, to be exact, indulging multiple genres and featuring excerpts of conversation with friends, family and a trusted reader of tarot and the stars to meditate on the waters of her relational urges, from the primordial to the petty.Shaped to emulate the trajectory of a relationship, the album ruminates on everything the risk of loving entails curiosity, resentment, the loneliness of loss, the strain which precedes surrender, the weight of memory and the lifelong process of learning to trust not only others but oneself. Its not butterflies and fireworks, she sings on Tiny Garden. Its gonna be a tiny garden But I feed it everyday.Water Made Us, which features performances from Saba duendita , and Peter CottonTale, shifts from soulful RB to acoustic folk, from autotuned dreampop to pure hip hop. Wolfsheep is a strummed ballad, while Boomerang adopts a bedroompop groove. At first glance, the record may read as a scattered amalgamation of journalled revelations, but measured by the careful consolidation of its many tiny details, it may be Woodss most intentional, fleshedout project to date.LEGACY LEGACY saw Woods dancing on the shoulders of the giants after which she titled her songs, ranging from Betty Davis to JeanMichel Basquiat, and channeling their strength. Water Made Us, on the other hand, sees her soften. While the fiery LEGACY LEGACY celebrated discernment, confidence and selfpreservation, Water Made Us is wet, and revels in vulnerability and permeability.Why not have pleasure ... Love is the warmest weather, she sings on opener Bugs. Someone will break your tiny little rules, she admits in a poetic interlude midsong. On Water Made Us, Woods is still selfassured, but shes also sinking her teeth which are still not employed, by the way into the inevitability of notknowing, and the necessity of opening up. Someone will jump fully clothed into the moat you dug outside, she continues on Bugs. Its not that deep.Released a week after her birthday, Water Made Us is a true libra, holding Woodss porous, chameleonlike nature So many women in me, she sang years ago on BASQUIAT with playful reverence. Water Made Us also holds space for her various creative selves, sometimes even on the same song. Wreckage Room, for example, begins with a lofi twinkling of keys under a heavy veil of static, over which Woodss distorted voice hums like a warning. Then, a minute into the track, the instrumental backdrop clarifies and her voice soars, as if from a different body entirely, building layer by layer to a revelatory finale that sharply juxtaposes the autotuned first verses.On Practice, she luxuriates, meditating on the act of slowing down as not only a gift but a delicious inevitability. Still sees her chase her own tail in the ritual spiral of letting go, while I Miss All My Exes, sung with the measured grace of hindsight, is a monumental ode to everyone shes bid goodbye despite being unable to abandon what theyve given her. In voice recordings that punctuate the records unfolding, her psychic holds space for her, her great uncle speaks of the old days, and her friend giggles about how confounding it is to try and trust your gut.Perhaps most importantly, Water Made Us sees Woods give herself more room than ever. Instead of framing her story through the narratives of her predecessors as she did quite literally on LEGACY LEGACY or through broader social context, she turns to herself and toward the domestic realm, carefully traversing the waters of her inner world. Centered in this selfawareness, a myriad of possibilities emerge. Jagjaguwar|1

To be clear, we are not advocating that we slam real estate investors, torch the housing market and tank the economy. We must tread carefully now that real estate is around 13 per cent of GDP.|Open this photo in gallery Real estate properties in Toronto on July 12.Christopher KatsarovThe Globe and Mail George Athanassakos is a professor of finance and the Ben Graham Chair in Value Investing at the Ivey Business School, Western University, London, Ont. Scott Gryba is a professional engineer and an international finance specialist. He also holds an MBA degree from the Ivey business school. Housing affordability will not improve until house prices drop. If were unwilling to face this truth, were going to continue to make things worse. To quote Berkshire Hathaways Charlie Munger It is important to face reality its especially important to face reality when you dont like it. Economics 101 tells us prices are set by the interplay of supply and demand. Regarding the housing crisis, we hear a lot about the supply issue but, other than the pressures brought on by immigration, the demand side of the equation gets very little attention. And that aspect of the housing crisis must also be addressed if we want so see a return to affordability for firsttime buyers. On the supply side, you have arguments for increasing density in residential neighbourhoods through multiunit residences, which will of course increase supply. However, the impact of this supply on prices isnt immediately apparent. For example, say an old house on a halfacre lot is redeveloped as a fourunit townhouse in south Oak Bay in Victoria. It will take about three to four years for that supply come on the market and it will be absorbed by the market at high prices because of population growth. Basically, youre tearing down a 3million single unit and building four homes that will sell for at least 1.2million each. It is true that this creates new supply for upper middleclass professionals, but this isnt the type of supply that will get us out of this crisis. Proponents of increasing supply would say we should streamline the process to build new homes and flood the market. However, the ontheground reality is that the process cant be streamlined. There are multiple and significant obstacles that new supply must navigate before coming to market. Some of these can be mitigated by the respective provincial governments but many hard issues are beyond their control. Issues such as the lack of skilled trades, supply chain constraints and commodity availability are beyond the purview of our governments. Furthermore, wellinformed and wellorganized NIMBY groups that are highly motivated will always find ways to throw sand in the gears of any potential new development affecting the character of their neighbourhood. The cumulative result of these factors is that while supply trickles on, the market absorbs the new units and prices stay high. To improve affordability, you dont necessarily have to try to lower prices through building more supply. Supply can be increased by tamping down demand, as the central bank has been doing through raising interest rates. In addition to interest rates, the other main demand aspect is immigration. We agree that this is important to our economy and will be a more important factor going forward however, it isnt what drove the prices to where they are now. The last price runup was during the COVID19 shutdowns when there was no immigration, so clearly there are other more dominant variables putting upward pressure on prices. We believe that the issue of demand by investors should get more attention. According to the Bank of Canada, investors are the fastest growing mortgage segment with a 30percent share of mortgaged home purchases nationally in the first part of this year, up from 19.6 per cent in 2020. They are now a bigger segment than repeat homebuyers and, over the past few years, have taken 6 per cent of market share from firsttime buyers. In the midst of a housing affordability crisis, this is not the preferred state of affairs. On this front, there are potential interventions that would be effective in restricting demand. First, for example, a lifetime cap of 1million on the personal residence capital gain exemption would effectively curtail demand. Such a policy would have no direct effect on people if they dont sell their primary residence and would have very limited impact on Canadians living in less expensive communities. This policy change would limit unproductive investment in the real estate sector by discouraging retirement strategies based on the gains made from selling a house. It would also stop the investment strategy of buying a house, renovating, living in it the minimum amount of time to claim the tax credit and then flipping it for a taxfree gain. Second, there could be a limit applied to the amount of interest that can be recorded as a business expense for singlefamily residences let as rental properties. Both policies would reduce demand, bring more supply to market, and lower prices and thus improve affordability. To be clear, we are not advocating that we slam real estate investors, torch the housing market and tank the economy. We must tread carefully now that real estate is around 13 per cent of GDP. However, we are advocating that these policies, or policies that would have a similar effect on investor demand, should at least be a part of the conversation when considering options to improve affordability.

There were days Robert wondered why he had left a fulltime job as a water resources consulting engineer, particularly when he wasnt successful in applying But now as a recent recipient of the Jain Family Award for Entrepreneurship, he is no longer questioning coming back to the University of Waterloo for his third environmental engineering degree. For Robert, the award made possible by a gift from the Vijay Anand Foundation to encourage student entrepreneurship at Waterloo is providing financial assistance and, perhaps more importantly, confirmation that his research has significant potential. Before I received the award, I definitely had some moments of selfdoubt, he said. Part of receiving the award was validation that I had made the right decision to pursue a PhD. It was during his time as a municipal engineering consultant that Robert discovered the need for new floodplain mapping technology. I had seen how things are done and practised and I had some ideas about how the technology could be improved, he said. Floodplain mapping is becoming an increasingly important issue with climate change where more intense flooding is expected, not less. Together with civil and environmental engineering professors James Craig and Bryan Tolson, Robert is developing Blackbird, a more effective method for floodplain mapping. Unlike flood maps used today, Blackbirds will be both realtime and twodimensional and could substantially impact flood mitigation and emergency response, potentially leading to lower costs and risk to life. Shortly after he began his PhD in 2020, Robert launched Heron Hydrologic, a company that provides training and other services related to hydrologic modelling, calibration and data analysis. Craig, Roberts MASc supervisor, and Tolson, his doctoral supervisor, are also part of Heron Hydrologic. The father of three under three has a fourthdegree black belt and both practises and teaches karate at Legacy Martial Arts and Fitness in Kitchener, where he has been a member for over 24 years. In addition to impressive time management skills, Robert credits the support of his wife and awards such as the Jain Family Award for Entrepreneurship for allowing him to work on his PhD and keep up with all the other professional and personal parts of his busy life. He expects to complete his doctorate in spring 2024 and then work full time on Blackbird and Heron Hydrologic. The University of Waterloo is the right school to provide the best opportunities to succeed, Robert said. Im looking forward to what the future will bring.

How to be a board member, and free fitness classes for staff A message from the University of Waterloo Staff Association UWSA. Volunteering to be on the board of directors for a charity or notforprofit organization can be intimidating. Board Foundations is a 60 to 90minute virtual workshop for UWaterloo staff that focuses on the key concepts and responsibilities of board leadership, with a goal to answer questions and make board roles more accessible. Participants will learn about the legal roles and responsibilities of boards and board members. The session will provide an overview of fiduciary, strategic, and generative leadership responsibilities, and will touch on the legislation that provides the framework for governance in Ontario. An organization is strongest when it includes diverse perspectives. A boards culture needs to celebrate diversity of voices and enable everyone to safely contribute. The workshops will apply an antioppression lens on governance and help participants understand their role in developing an inclusive organizational culture. This is a new component that will be beneficial to those who attended the workshop last year. Registration is open on Portal there are five offerings of the workshop between October 16 and March 21, so you can choose a date that works for you. Funding for this workshop is provided by the Staff Excellence Fund. Other currently funded projects you can attend include Workplace Yoga, Pilates Party, and daily fitness and wellness programming from Athletics.

By placing an emphasis on preventing and mitigating disasters before they happen, were helping to protect British Columbians from the impacts of climate change. We know Indigenous communities have been disproportionately affected by disasters, and partnering with First Nations on our emergency management framework is extremely important. Consultation and cooperation with Indigenous communities and leaders in all phases of emergency management is required under the new Act. This is an important step in aligning our approach with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples particularly related to selfdetermination and First Nations participation in decisions that affect them. While these actions are helping better prepare us for the future, we know its been an incredibly challenging time for people in the last few years. In the Fraser Valley, including communities I represent, we continue to feel impacts of the atmospheric rivers in 2021. Across the province, this years wildfire season was particularly harrowing, leading to tens of thousands of people evacuating, hundreds of homes lost and a long and difficult season for those on the front lines. Were doing everything we can to prepare for next year. Thats why, in addition to this legislation, our government has launched an expert task force on emergencies to determine how we can better support evacuees, frontline workers and volunteers and apply the lessons we have learned to prepare for the 2024 wildfire season. By engaging frontline workers, community members, First Nations, local governments, farmers and industries that faced challenges during the 2023 wildfire season, the task force will provide actionoriented advice to government and partners on how we can improve for future emergencies. The safety of British Columbians and protecting our diverse and beautiful landscape will always be a priority for our government. We know that we cant predict the future, but we are doing the work now to be prepared and strengthen our provinces resilience for years to come.

But whats left of the formerly powerful storm will unload heavy rainfall, raising the threat of flash flooding across portions of western Mexico. Lidias center was shredded apart by the mountainous terrain of western Mexico early Wednesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. Despite the lack of an organized center, whats left of Lidia will bring an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain to the country on Wednesday. Rainfall totals from the storm could come close to 12 inches. Flash flooding is possible across several Mexico states, especially Nayarit, Jalisco and Colima, as heavy rain pounds the area. Heavy rain may also lead to dangerous mudslides in mountainous terrain. Lidia had brought preliminary rainfall totals of 5.3 inches to Colima and 5.1 inches to Manzanillo as of early Wednesday. Lidia rapidly intensified at an exceptional pace right before landfall Tuesday on Mexicos west coast. The hurricanes winds increased by 70 mph in 24 hours in the warm coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean. The landfall was the strongest on Mexicos west coast since 2015s Hurricane Patricia. Rapid intensification is happening more often, especially immediately before landfall, because of humancaused climate change. Its just one of the ways the climate crisis is making hurricanes more dangerous. Swells generated by Lidia on Tuesday will likely cause lifethreatening surf and rip current conditions along the west coast of Mexico and Baja California peninsula through Wednesday. Moisture from Lidias remnants will send some rain into South Texas on Wednesday. Rain is desperately needed as this part of Texas battles severe and exceptional drought, according to the latest report from the US Drought Monitor.

During her undergrad, she joined the Waterloo Architecture Students Association WASA and got involved in research work as an assistant with the Buoyant Foundation Project a notforprofit organization founded by Waterloo architecture professor Dr. Elizabeth English. The Buoyant Foundation Project was a perfect fit for me as it investigates how amphibious technologies can retrofit housing to better withstand rising water levels and flooding. This has shaped my masters thesis topic to focus on flood mitigation amphibious architecture in Canada.Holder is still part of the Buoyant Foundation Project team, now in the role of project manager. Regardless of where her important work takes her, Holder knows that the connections shes made at Waterloo will stay with her.|When she was 16 years old, Alexa Megan Holder spent a month camping and canoeing in Northern Ontario. She loved it so much that she became a wilderness guide with the YMCA, taking kids between six and 16 years old on river trips. Her recreational love of wild waters grew into an academic interest that guided her towards Waterloos Faculty of Engineering for a Bachelor of Architectural Studies BAS. Holder crosses the stage at convocation this fall to mark the completion of her undergraduate degree, though her studies at Waterloo will continue. Holder recently began her Master of Architecture MArch degree in the Collaborative Water Program, with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council SSHRC. For her thesis, she plans to focus on how building design can mitigate flood related issues and disasters. Paddling together Overseen by the Universitys Water Institute, the Collaborative Water Program involves 11 academic units to deliver the most interdisciplinary water graduate program in Canada. For Holder, this opportunity to focus her research on water, and work with students from other disciplines, is invaluable. University studies are typically siloed into faculties, Holder says. You dont often get a chance to collaborate with other disciplines, share knowledge and ideas, and engage with different viewpoints at least not formally. And yet in practice, a lot of what we do as architects is an interdisciplinary effort that can involve engineers, designers, archeologists, policy makers, social workers, urban planners and more. Interdisciplinary academic experience is critical to elevate our research and our work. I believe it will help prepare us and many other professionals for the big issues that we hope to address in the coming years. Getting involved Holder intentionally pursued a wellrounded university experience that went beyond academics. During her undergrad, she joined the Waterloo Architecture Students Association WASA and got involved in research work as an assistant with the Buoyant Foundation Project a notforprofit organization founded by Waterloo architecture professor Dr. Elizabeth English. I wanted to learn more about what research in architecture looks like, Holder says. The Buoyant Foundation Project was a perfect fit for me as it investigates how amphibious technologies can retrofit housing to better withstand rising water levels and flooding. This has shaped my masters thesis topic to focus on flood mitigation amphibious architecture in Canada. Holder is still part of the Buoyant Foundation Project team, now in the role of project manager. She credits her undergraduate experience with the foundation, as well as her five coop work terms, with helping her develop her capabilities and confidence. She worked in Rotterdam, Elora, Toronto, Victoria and New York an exciting mix of local and international exposure to different ways of living and working. I did a lot of hiking and rock climbing in Victoria, not so much in New York, Holder explains. The two cities are worlds apart, so it was great to experience both and get a better idea of what and where suits me before I start looking for a fulltime job. Changing currents Once shes completed her masters degree, Holder wants to work in sustainability and climate change disaster mitigation, and is open to roles as either an academic researcher or an architect in the field. Regardless of where her important work takes her, Holder knows that the connections shes made at Waterloo will stay with her. Our class of 2023 is a very closeknit group, she says. The School of Architecture campus is small which makes getting to know each other easy. Most of us in my cohort are not from the area so when we were firstyear students, we grabbed our orientation packs and went looking for housing together. By the end of that first day, Id made some good friends, including my current roommate. We moved in together in our second year and still live together. I imagine a lot of new firstyear students are still settling in and figuring things out. Change is challenging but its amazing to discover what youre made of. For me, getting involved in areas outside my course work was hugely rewarding, introducing me to interesting ideas, experiences and people. Thanks to my undergraduate degree, I feel grounded and ready for this next adventure.|1

Coun. Kelly Fehr raised concerns over the steep price tag for the drone. Ive been looking into drones, and I know you can get some pretty decent ones for a couple hundred bucks. Whats the difference between a normal drone and a 27,000 drone Fire Chief David Lind explained the department is requesting up to 50,000 for a heavy tethered drone that would be flown in controlled airspace during emergencies. So were controlling the space, radio frequencies when were dealing with BC Wildfire, those types of agencies, were in contact with those resources when theyre in the area close to us, explained Lind. So we can have control of the drone, and then thats part of the tethering. So its tethered to a specific length, so that it wont exceed its height. Lind said the drone VFRS is looking at is in use at other fire and emergency services, and theyre finding them to be quite valuable. Council passed the request for funds of up to 50,000 for the tethered drone. Council agreed to move funding of up to 80,000 onto 2024 budget deliberations, the funding is to purchase fire suppression equipment specifically geared towards fighting electric vehicle fires. Lind explained that EV fires can be quite difficult to put out and require a tremendous amount of water. A lot of equipment is a blanket, if you will, that basically is pulled over the vehicle that helps contain the heat and the off gassing, from the fire, said Lind. And the other tool actually hooks up to water ... and our standard fire hoses. We place it under the vehicle and we lift it up into the area where the battery boxes are located and penetrating and then flood that area with water. Council also agreed to move the fire departments request to purchase its own electric vehicle for 69,000 to 2024 budget deliberations.|1

Will the events of this past summer convince everyone that climate is a top priority|As Canadians gathered for Thanksgiving this year, the extreme heat of the summer and early fall was not far from many of our minds. This unprecedented heat has melted away the last traces of climate change denial, as the true costs reveal themselves. Though climate policy remains a political hot potato, the Canadian debate has finally and definitively shifted from whether theres a serious need for a credible policy to how best to address it. As opposed to previous years, where extreme weather events though horrible were sporadic and regional, the summer of 2023 brought consistent and widespread horrors from around the world to our TV screens for months on end. Extreme floods wreaked havoc, as did wildfires, and some places were flooding and on fire at the same time. Because smoke doesnt respect borders, people hundreds of kilometres away were impacted by fires in other countries. And from east to west and north to south in our big, complicated country, many communities were negatively affected by extreme heat, floods and fires in unprecedented ways. Significantly, many media reports of these disasters explicitly linked them to climate change another change from previous years when climate change was often not mentioned as a factor. In 2023, the public was left with no doubt as to causality. As one example, the scientific experts at World Weather Attribution calculated that climate change more than doubled the likelihood of extreme fire weather conditions in Eastern Canada Climate change made the cumulative severity of Qubecs 2023 fire season to the end of July around 50 per cent more intense, and seasons of this severity at least seven times more likely to occur. Food insecurity got worse last year, especially for racialized families StatCan Though economists have long warned of the high cost being exacted by climate changedriven extreme weather, this summer, those calculations became far more real and close to home. For instance, the B.C. government estimated that so far this year, firefighting has cost the province 770 million, blowing away any previous years total. Layering on top the health costs exacted by wildfire smoke, that figure would be much higher, with such costs estimated at more than 1 billion for one week in June in Ontario alone. The City of Halifax estimated a cleanup bill of 20 million after a year that included a hurricane, fires and floods. There are two more summers until the mandatory date of the next federal election. Canadians are concerned about climate change impacts and expect the government to act to protect us from them, writes Rick Smith ClimateInstit cdnpoli ClimateRisk As perhaps the most extreme example of huge, new costs, this summer marked the acceleration of insurance companies around the world warning that climate change will render many properties increasingly uninsurable. State Farm, the largest homeowner insurance company in California, announced it would stop accepting new applications, including all business and personal lines property and casualty insurance. The group representing Canadian insurers warned that rates could skyrocket, or a lot of Canadians could be denied coverage if they live in areas where these extreme weather events typically happen. In Australia, home insurance rates jumped 28 per cent in the past year, according to the Actuaries Institute, which warned, Based on science, we expect these home insurance affordability pressures are likely to continue to worsen due to climate change. Homeowners have started to sit up and take notice. In the U.K., half of homeowners reported being concerned about climate change driving up their insurance rates.

Cinq mois aprs linondation du 1er mai qui a caus des dommages prs de 275 immeubles, BaieSaintPaul panse toujours ses plaies. Dimportants dgts sont encore visibles sur plusieurs maisons qui ont t dtriores par les eaux et plusieurs des rsidences les plus endommages devront tre dmolies. Plus de 600 rsidents avaient d tre vacus lors de ce sinistre de lt 2023 qui a caus la mort de deux pompiers en amont, SaintUrbain. Le ministre de la Scurit publique, Franois Bonnardel, avait parl dun cocktail parfait caus par un mlange de fortes pluies locales et de fonte des neiges dans la Rserve faunique des Laurentides.

Dans le but den rduire les risques, elle avait demand des subventions quoffrait Qubec pour renforcer ou construire des ouvrages de protection la suite des grandes crues printanires de 2017 et 2019. Or, la premire phase de financement adresse au ministre des Affaires municipales pour le rehaussement dun ouvrage de protection contre la rivire du Gouffre, responsable de ce gchis, avait t refuse le 30 mars, un mois avant les vnements. Le ministre avait justifi son refus parce que la subvention demande concernait un ouvrage de contrle de lrosion plutt quun ouvrage de protection contre les inondations La ville affirme quau total, 273 immeubles ont t affects par les effets des pluies torrentielles du 1er mai, dont 89 commerces.

To fulfil that recommendation, MNRF will be leading the flood strategy commitment to establish a provincial urban flooding work group, Rolf von den BaumenClark told the committee. I dont know what the Urban Flooding Working Group is Are we developing an Urban Flooding Policy|After a yearslong backandforth, the government has now convened an urban flooding working group. EDITORS NOTE This article originally appeared on The Trillium, a new Village Media website devoted exclusively to covering provincial politics at Queens Park. In April, Ontario promised to create a working group on flooding. In June, the responsible ministers office appeared to have never heard of it. But yes as of October, it does exist, the ministry now co Rdnfirms. Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry MNRF thendeputy minister Monique Rolf von den BaumenClark made the pledge on April 3, saying her ministry would take the lead on an intragovernmental working group to address urban flooding. The group was to be a response to the auditor generals 2022 report, which found a lack of leadership on the file. In a legislative committee discussing the AG report, Rolf von den BaumenClark said the group would be made up of the Ministries of Natural Resources and Forestry, Environment, Conservation and Parks, Municipal Affairs and Housing, Infrastructure and Transportation, and some municipalities. It would identify roles and responsibilities related to urban flooding, determine new or emerging urban flooding issues and develop a provincial framework for urban flooding policy, she said. To fulfil that recommendation, MNRF will be leading the flood strategy commitment to establish a provincial urban flooding work group, Rolf von den BaumenClark told the committee. NDP climate critic Peter Tabuns asked when the working group would be convened and when it would start writing reports. Rolf von den BaumenClark initially refused to offer a timeline but said, We will start this year, after Tabuns pressed her. Just two months later, the ministers top policy staffer appeared not to have heard of the project. According to internal emails received through a freedomofinformation request, a ministry staffer contacted several employees in Natural Resources and Forestry Minister Graydon Smiths office on June 1. She was looking for approval to get back to the legislative committee with a more specific timeline. Proposed Answer The provincial urban flooding working group will be established this summer, with deliberations to be held through this fall and winter and a final frameworkreport to be completed in the spring of 2024, the ministry staffer wrote. A response came the next morning from Smiths director of policy, Matthew Stubbings. I dont know what the Urban Flooding Working Group is he wrote. Are we developing an Urban Flooding Policy Please advice. sic A couple of hours later, Stubbings asked the ministry to tone down its proposed committee answer because Smith and his staff didnt know enough about the group. I dont think we offer any time commitments without the ministers office and minister being briefed on this groups terms of reference and broader policy objectives, he wrote. I propose we change the language to something like the... Ministry will be considering establishing a working group in the coming months... On Thursday, ministry spokesperson Richard Mullin said the group has been established and will indeed meet this fall. Ontarios 2020 flooding strategy pledged to establish a working group with provincial agencies to identify custodians for flood mapping information, including base data, with clear roles and responsibilities. In the auditor generals report, she notes that the ministry had drafted terms of reference and invitations to participate in the group back in 2020, following a report from a Special Advisor on Flooding that recommended its creation but it still hadnt been created as of 2022. The province is well aware of the need to do more to address this issue, thenauditor general Bonnie Lysyk wrote, noting that four reports and plans had made recommendations. Yet the province has never clarified provincial roles for addressing and coordinating actions needed to alleviate the risk of urban flooding, with the result that gaps in responsibility persist and actions and commitments have never been implemented. The government seemed to backtrack on its plan to create a flood group after Lysyks report. Four ministries told her theyd work within their own mandates on flooding, but none agreed to develop a provincial framework that clearly identifies and assigns roles and responsibilities for urban flood management, Lysyk wrote. Floodprone communities have called for more help from higher levels of government, singling out the siloed nature of support. Some say governments could learn something from the Americans, whose Army Corps of Engineers is creating a plan to protect the shorelines of eight states along the Great Lakes. Thenenvironment minister David Piccini promised in August to call on the feds to create a similar plan. He also said there would be an announcement from Ottawa on that front in the fall, but the feds said they werent sure what he was talking about.|1

Keenleyside, Duncan and Mica to better support ecosystems, Indigenous cultural values and socioeconomic interests here in the B.C. Basin. Photo courtesy Columbia Basin Trust As someone who has called Castlegar home since childhood, I am very disturbed to see the current situation in the Arrow Lakes Reservoir. This region is ingrained in my own personal history my family camped, swam, fished and boated in the lakes, close to our home. These waters have been part of my life for more than half a century and, like many others who call this place home, Im deeply troubled by what weve seen over the past few months. I wish there was an easy way to fix this. I have shared your frustration over the summer and into fall, watching the impact on recreation, tourism, our economy, and our fish and wildlife habitats. As you may know, there are several factors at play here the first is a severe drought that has covered more than 80 of the province this summer, which we cannot control. Its also vital that a certain amount of water is held in Kinbasket Reservoir to meet B.C.s anticipated electricity demand for winter. The other factor is the Columbia River Treaty, which requires B.C. to send a specific volume of water to the United States at certain times of year for flood protection and, in the case of this summer, powergeneration purposes. As troubling as the situation has become this summer, it has drawn attention to the treaty, which is a positive thing. The treaty has been a part of the Columbia Basin for almost 60 years, and all of us know that there is a critical need to improve it. Canada, B.C. and the Ktunaxa, Secwepemc and Syilx Okanagan Nations are striving to modernize the treaty through the negotiation process. Though I am not at the negotiating table, as minister responsible for the Columbia River Treaty, I am in frequent contact with the B.C. treaty team and federal and Indigenous leaders to emphasize what needs to change. One of our key goals is to gain more flexibility for how B.C. operates its treaty dams Hugh L. Keenleyside, Duncan and Mica to better support ecosystems, Indigenous cultural values and socioeconomic interests here in the B.C. Basin. B.C.s negotiating team has shared photos and stories from Arrow Lakes Reservoir this summer with their American counterparts to illustrate how important this additional flexibility is. The letters we receive, the photos and posts we see on social media, the news reports, all of this strengthens our negotiating position to create a modernized agreement that reduces these types of impacts in the future. To specifically tackle the situation in Arrow Lakes Reservoir, I will be taking part in a virtual information session on Oct. 18 at 6 p.m. Pacific time. I will be joined by representatives from the Canadian Columbia River Treaty negotiating team and BC Hydro, who will share information about the difficult conditions were facing this year and whats being done to reduce these types of impacts in the future. This session is just the latest step in a decadelong engagement process led by the provincial governments Columbia River Treaty team. We have been engaging with Indigenous Nations, local governments and residents since 2012 to not only hear how the treaty impacted them, but to find out how it could be improved in the future. We have connected with people through more than 40 inperson community meetings, virtual sessions, social media, newsletters, emails, letters and oneonone phone calls. I encourage you to read engagement reports from 2013, 2018 and 2019 to learn what weve heard from each community, at httpsengage.gov.bc.cacolumbiarivertreatyengagementprocess Before any agreement on a modernized Columbia River Treaty is finalized, we will return to the basin to explain what is being proposed and seek feedback. In the meantime, I look forward to speaking to you at the Arrow Lakes Reservoir information session on Oct. 18, from 6 p.m. until 730 p.m. Pacific time, and 7 p.m. until 830 p.m. Mountain time via Zoom webinar.

And, despite rain and lower temperatures in recent days, several months of moisture are needed to break a drought. Usually we receive between six and eight inches of precipitation throughout the growing season which is well needed and well used, and this year was significantly less than that. It was between one to two inches of rain during the growing season, so it was definitely less than what was needed, explained Jason Miller with the Raymond Irrigation District. Calgary continues to see record low levels in the Bow and Elbow Rivers, and a statement from Calgary Water Services says, those restrictions are in place to help sustain Calgarys water supply in the Glenmore reservoir something Miller says is essential to helping Alberta survive and thrive. They help mitigate flooding when its a rain event, it mitigates drought events like weve had. They really protect us from dry years and flood years and are key to our agricultural existence here, he added. Miller adds a heavy snow pack this winter will be key for a crop rebound in southern Alberta. Any precipitation like that is very welcome and we can capture the runoff generally from that in the different reservoirs, so thatll help build up the storage for next year, he said. And then, we need a really good snowpack, thats what it really boils down to we need a good snowpack, maybe some good spring snow thatll help fill the reservoirs and that will definitely make it so we can have a good crop here next year.Some areas of the country dealt with their third or fourth consecutive year of drought this season. The 2021 season was one of the worst with production at its lowest in more than a decade. Dry conditions have accelerated the push for effective irrigation systems across the country. In Alberta, in 2020, the province and the federal government through the Canada Infrastructure Bank announced a 932million project to rehabilitate older irrigation equipment in the province, as well as construct or enlarge up to four offstream irrigation storage reservoirs.

So as a result, city council is being asked to declare a climate crisis when it meets next Monday afternoon, Oct. 16. Municipalities are understood to produce andor have regulatory jurisdiction over approximately 50 of carbon emissions in Canada and as such have a responsibility to take actions within their direct control, influence and advocacy, says the draft resolution going to council. At its April 3 meeting, staff told council it was not going to reach its target of a 45 reduction in emissions below the citys 2010 level by 2030.

When asked what the implications of a formal Council climate crisis would be, staff have repeatedly stated that current efforts underway will continue regardless however, it is incumbent upon us, as the elected leaders of our community, to communicate clearly to the residents of Kelowna the importance of urgent action on a government and communitywide basis in the face of the climate crisis that we all face, the resolution says. The impacts of global climate breakdown have already resulted in local states of emergency due to wildfire, extreme heat and flooding over four of the past five years, having direct impacts on Kelownas economy, city budgets, health, security, quality of life and ecosystems. While the resolution declares a climate crisis, it doesnt include any action items to address the issue. As such, as recommended by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the City of Kelowna must declare a climate crisis in the knowledge that this is an emergency with no foreseeable conclusion and requires immediate and drastic action away from a businessasusual approach in order to sustain our quality of life, including our thriving tourism, technology and agricultural sectors our citizen health and affordability and our public infrastructure and celebrated environment, the resolution concludes.

It is the first step in what could become the EUs inaugural investigation under the Digital Services Act, in this case to determine if the site formerly known as Twitter is in compliance with the tough new rules meant to keep users safe online and stop the spread of harmful content. San Franciscobased X has until Wednesday to respond to questions related to how its crisis response protocol is functioning. Responses to other questions must be received by Oct. 31. The commission said its next steps, which could include the opening of formal proceedings and penalties, would be determined by Xs replies. Representatives for X did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. The companys CEO, Linda Yaccarino, said earlier that the site has removed hundreds of Hamaslinked accounts and taken down or labeled tens of thousands of pieces of content since the militant groups attack on Israel. One social media expert called the actions a drop in the bucket. Yaccarino on Thursday outlined steps taken by X to combat illegal content flourishing on the platform. She was responding to an earlier letter from a top European Union official for information on how X is complying with the EUs new digital rules during the IsraelHamas war. That letter, which essentially served as a warning, was not legally binding the latest one, however, is. X is proportionately and effectively assessing and addressing identified fake and manipulated content during this constantly evolving and shifting crisis, Yaccarino said in a letter to European Commissioner Thierry Breton, the 27nation blocs digital enforcer. But some say the efforts are not nearly enough to tackle the problem. While these actions are better than nothing, it is not enough to curtail the misinformation problem on X, said Kolina Koltai, a researcher at the investigative collective Bellingcat who previously worked at Twitter on Community Notes. There is an overwhelming amount of misinformation on the platform, Koltai said. From what we have seen, the moderation efforts from X are only addressing a drop in the bucket. Since the war erupted, photos and videos have flooded social media of the carnage, including haunting footage of Hamas fighters taking terrified Israelis hostage, alongside posts from users pushing false claims and misrepresenting videos from other events. The conflict is one of the first major tests for the EUs groundbreaking digital rules, which took effect in August. Breton fired off a similar letter Thursday to TikTok, telling CEO Shou Zi Chew that he has a particular obligation to protect child and teen users from violent content depicting hostage taking and other graphic videos reportedly making the rounds on the video sharing app. For X, changes that Musk has made to the platform since he bought it last year mean accounts that subscribe to Xs bluecheck service can get paid if their posts go viral, creating a financial incentive to post whatever gets the most reaction. Plus, Xs workforce including its content moderation team has been gutted. Those changes are running up against the EUs Digital Services Act, which forces social media companies to step up policing of their platforms for illegal content, such as terrorist material or illegal hate speech, under threat of hefty fines. There is no place on X for terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups and we continue to remove such accounts in real time, including proactive efforts, Yaccarino wrote in the letter posted to X. X has taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content, Yaccarino said, pointing out that there are 700 unique Community Notes a feature that allows users to add their own factchecks to posts related to the attacks and unfolding events. The platform has been responding promptly and in a diligent and objective manner to takedown requests from law enforcement agencies from around the world, including more than 80 from EU member states, Yaccarino said. Koltai, the researcher and former Twitter employee, said Community Notes are not an endall solution to curtailing misinfo and that there are gaps that the feature just cant fill yet. There are still many videos and photos on X that dont have notes that are unmoderated, and continue to spread misleading claims, she said. Since Musk acquired Twitter and renamed it, socialmedia watchers say the platform has become not just unreliable but actively promotes falsehoods, while a study commissioned by the EU found that its the worstperforming platform for online disinformation. Rivals such as TikTok, YouTube and Facebook also are coping with a flood of unsubstantiated rumors and falsehoods about the Middle Eastern conflict, playing the typical whackamole that erupts each time a news event captures world attention.

Here are some tips to make sure you have the right coverage and amount of insurance. Factors that influence the price of insurance Insurance cost is always subject to a number of factors, including the type of business, aspects of the building you occupy and the commercial vehicles you use. The key factor taken into account are Business activities Products and services Annual income Area served deliveries, transporting goods, etc. The value of goods in inventory and equipment Building Features age, type, materials, etc. Location Surrounding area flood zones, proximity to public services, etc. Type of neighbourhood industrial, commercial, residential Added protection measures linked alarm system, sprinklers, surveillance system with camera, etc. Commercial vehicles Type of vehicle Its use delivery, transporting goods, etc. Number of drivers and their driving record The territory covered The importance of choosing the right protection Take the time to list the coverages you need or may need when youre getting ready to sign or renew your business insurance policy. These questions will help you better identify what you need to consider What kinds of occurrences might impact your operations How much is your business worth, including commercial property building and its contents Do you work with your hands or do you provide consulting services Do you sell your products online or in a store Do clients come and meet with you at your workplace Do you require a commercial vehicle for your business Tips for getting a fair premium, and even saving Here are some tips to reduce your business insurance costs while maintaining sufficient coverage. Review your coverage needs and choices. Your company changes and so do its needs. Its useful to regularly review your coverage in light of your companys current needs. Note that it is important to be honest about your income when requesting a quote. That way youll avoid unpleasant surprises in the event of a claim. Also make sure that the cost to rebuild the building is consistent with the insured value in your policy. Combine your products Combining coverage can reduce your premium. An entrepreneur who owns several businesses for example, real estate assets will benefit from insuring them with a single insurer. Monitor your financial health Your personal credit score can affect your business insurance. Think about your location Geographic region affects premiums. A less densely populated area can reduce costs. Avoid cutting costs at any cost. In times of inflation, it can be very tempting to temporarily remove certain coverages to lighten the budget. But remember that what you sacrifice in prevention, you gain in increased risk and vulnerability. The goal is to have the right coverage to ensure your companys longterm viability at the right price.

OUTLOOK The final day of September marked the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation in Canada, and in the town of Outlook, events held to mark the occasion helped local students gain more understanding of the days significance and also took a lot of emotion out of grown adults. On Thursday, September 28 at the Bounty Theatre, Grade 8 students from Outlook High School were joined by a few other adults in witnessing the presentation held by George Fayant, a Mtis man born and raised in southern Saskatchewan near the QuAppelle Valley. Fayants presentation to everyone was centered on the history and the significance of the Red River Cart, which he has been building for 25 years. Fayant builds the carts in various scales and he routinely gives presentations and workshops on the history of these carts, including how they were built using antique tools. George Fayant spoke to students and others about the history of the Red River cart. Photo Derek RuttleThe Outlook The Red River cart was a mode of transportation used by Mtis people in the Prairies during the settlement of the West in the midto late1800s to carry loads across distances. The name of the cart derives from the Red River, along which the Red River Colony 181270, inhabited mainly by Mtis peoples, was settled. One of the more interesting aspects about these carts is that theyre completely held together by connecting joints in the wood rather than spikes or nails, allowing them to be disassembled at any time. This would be useful to the people who used them generations ago, as in addition to its use as a transportation vessel, the cart served as a temporary home during long trips. Talking about the history of the cart, George also touched on a number of other items, such as beaver pelts, showing everyone a top hat that was constructed out of the material. Discussing the aspect of trading, Fayant explained that any transaction being carried out had to be an equal one. For example, if you had a number of animal pelts to trade and you were seeking a rifle, then you had to match the height of the gun in pelts in order to acquire the weapon. Students actually put together a wheel for the cart. Photo Derek RuttleThe Outlook Getting the students involved in the process, George invited a few of them to try and assemble the cart themselves, and everyone was then invited to take part in a crafts activity building their very own handheld mini carts, providing an opportunity for the kids to take home a keepsake after having their eyes opened to the ways of life for some in our country. Two days later on Saturday, September 30, the Bounty Theatre hall was once again the location for a special event, this one being a blanket exercise hosted by Sharon Meyer. A member of the Cree Nation, Beardys Okemasis First Nation, Meyer is a guest speaker and a Medicine Wheel knowledge keeper who recently retired from her position of First Nation and Mtis consultant for the North East School Division, where she helped incorporate Indigenous ways of learning into the classroom. Sharon Meyers presentation started with a ceremonial smudge. Photo Derek RuttleThe Outlook Beginning the day with a ceremonial smudge, Meyer walked around to each person sitting in the circle, who wafted the smoke towards them. Going over some historical facts, she spoke of medicine and how its not just the items bought in a health store that can be called as such. Your words are medicine, said Sharon. Your racism can bring someone down, and your positivity can bring someone up. A series of video clips aided Meyers presentation throughout the morning, including music videos and one clip signifying how no Indigenous person can just get over it in Canada, pointing to the countrys dark past when it comes to First Nations relations. The biggest portion of the mornings events then took place in the form of a blanket exercise. The blanket exercise is an interactive way to teach and learn 500 years of CanadianIndigenous history. Blankets are placed on the floor and participants stand on them, taking on the roles of First Nations people arriving to Canada, or Turtle Island as it was known in many circles, while others may portray European colonizers, who come in and begin to systematically remove personal items, rights and the identities that strip away at the heart of the Indigenous people. The exercise is narrated, beginning the story hundreds of years ago and bringing it all the way up to modern times, showing the shrinking and depletion of the things that make First Nations people who they were back then and who they are today. The exercise, in which more than a dozen people in Outlook took part in that day, was an emotionallydraining one for the participants. Watching the blankets get removed by settlers and seeing the group of people become more cramped signified the reductions of their First Nations identities in Canada as the years wore on. Whether it was completely eyeopening for some and a harsh reminder for others, there were plenty of tears shed following the exercise, in which a sharing circle was held where everyone was given an opportunity to share what they learned from the days events. Meyers talk with those present opened many eyes to the realities faced by Indigenous populations. Photo Derek RuttleThe Outlook Some harsh truths and some eyeopening revelations came out of that circle, and the one consistent thing that was noticed was how hopeful everyone was for a better and more understanding future. The one thing I always hear, the word hope comes out, said Sharon, adding that its what she routinely hears from other participants in the exercise. Following the event, everyone enjoyed a lunch of soup and bannock that was held in the hall, with food supplied by the commercial kitchen of Outlook High School. Whether change continues to happen and empathy continues to be had from nonIndigenous people will be up to the people of Saskatchewan and all of Canada to ultimately decide.|1

The question has already come up in the United States and the United Kingdom, where national flood insurance programs exist. Canada does not have a national flood program, although the federal government pledged to build one in its 2023 budget. And if I look at Flood Re the national flood insurance program in the U.K., one of the reasons they did Flood Re was not because flood coverage wasnt available. If you had a flood in a highrisk flood zone, they would not allow reconstruction, Wolfe said.|When Canadian homeowners finally get access to Canadas proposed national flood insurance program, PC insurance industry professionals are curious how it will will affect the countrys real estate and mortgage industries. The question has already come up in the United States and the United Kingdom, where national flood insurance programs exist. Canada does not have a national flood program, although the federal government pledged to build one in its 2023 budget. As part of the Canadian program, consumers will have online access to flood plain information that allows them to assess the risk of their home getting flooded. The federal government says the program should be announced publicly in Spring 2024, and Insurance Bureau of Canada IBC is calling for the government to launch the program in April 2025. IBC notes 10 or roughly 1.5 million Canadian households are built in highrisk flood areas. And about 90 of insurers flood liability is associated with this 10 of households. Fully onethird of the financial liability for flood resides in the riskiest 1 of households, IBC chief economist and vice president of policy development Jordan Brennan, said at a panel discussing flood insurance at the National Insurance Conference of Canada NICC in Montreal. So thats the situation we find ourselves in now. Thats the intolerable present. Canadian PC insurers are currently working with the federal government on a privatepublic partnership model to make flood insurance available to people living in these highrisk areas. In this model, theoretically, the private insurance industry will pay out for a certain portion of flood catastrophes, and a federal government backstop will cover flood damage above and beyond that threshold. One question open for discussion within Canadas PC industry is What happens if the value of a policyholders home is reduced because its found to be in a highrisk area for flooding If we say to a homeowner, youre actually in a high risk flood zone, what does that do to the value of their home If theyre going to have to resell itthere could be a small portion of our population, it could be one of us, who are sitting in a place where the value of our home is going to be not as good as it was before, said NICC panellist Susan Penwarden, managing director of personal lines at Aviva Canada. And if I look at Flood Re the national flood insurance program in the U.K., one of the reasons they did Flood Re was not because flood coverage wasnt available. It was because of the costs being so high. They really worried that if they suddenly moved to market cost for flood insurance, the mortgage market would crash, and the housing market would crash. And if anybody whos lived in the UK, as I have, knows, the housing market is big part of the economy over there. They were quite worriedit would be a precipitous drop. In talking to one of my colleagues whos involved with it, he said, Look, it was never about availability. It was about affordability, and then gradually moving that affordability to the right level. Part of the U.K. Flood Re model addresses the sensitive topic of strategic retreat. In other words, relocating people and developers out of floodprone areas. Matt Wolfe, president and CEO of Aon Reinsurance Solutions Canada, noted how the Flood Re model incorporates an element of strategic retreat into its model. If you had a flood in a highrisk flood zone, they would not allow reconstruction, Wolfe said. In addition, if it was in a designated highrisk flood zone, they wouldnt insure new construction. Thats a smart, gradual approach, where youre saying, Okay, postevent youll collect flood insurance. But were not going to rebuild there. Builders, developers, youre not going to be able to rebuild there and offload this risk to Flood Re. I think theres a great lesson for us as we move forward. One argument for creating a flood insurance program in Canada is that the lack of availability of flood insurance could actually make things worse for PC insurers. In the U.S., noted NICC panellist Jolee Crosby, incoming president and CEO of Swiss Re Canada English Caribbean, people are automatically given the basic flood coverage and must opt out of it. That way, they have to make a conscious decision not to be insured for flood. Thats a lesson we learned from the U.S., where its driven so much from the mortgage industry, said Crosbee. Those properties that dont have flood insurance, they dont have a mortgage on their property, so they choose not to get flood insurance. These are lowerincome properties that have been generational homes. After Hurricane Fiona came in and decimated a whole area of Florida, there was no flood insurance. And so people lost their homes. And then what happened You had opportunistic developers coming in and offering prices, offering to buy the property, and it creates this vicious circle. Because then people dont have a place to go for new housing. You can you build more expensive properties in place of other properties, and then it just creates more of a difficult situation. So I like the thought of going in that direction of people automatically getting opted into the national flood insurance program. Feature image courtesy of iStock.comdrewhadley|1

CLAIM A video shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un saying in a speech that he blames President Joe Biden for the latest IsraelHamas war. CLAIM The Israeli military confirmed it bombed a hospital in Gaza in a social media post written in Arabic. CLAIM A video shows a BBC News report confirming Ukraine provided weapons to Hamas. The video shows footage from the making of the 2022 short film directed by Awni Eshtaiwe, a filmmaker based in the West Bank.|In the days since Hamas militants stormed into Israel early Oct. 7, a flood of videos and photos purporting to show the conflict have filled social media, making it difficult for onlookers from around the world to sort fact from fiction. While plenty of real imagery and accounts of the ensuing carnage have emerged, they have been intermingled with users pushing false claims and misrepresenting videos from other events. Among the fabrications, users have shared false claims that a top Israeli commander had been kidnapped, circulated a false video imitating a BBC News report, and pushed old and unrelated clips of Russian President Vladimir Putin with inaccurate English captions. Here is a closer look at the misinformation spreading online and the facts. CLAIM Videos taken one day apart show a Palestinian crisis actor pretending to be seriously injured in a hospital bed one day and completely fine the next. THE FACTS Two different people appear in the videos. In addition, the video of the injured man in a hospital bed dates to August. The videos are being shared to falsely claim an injured man is an actor playing a Palestinian victim. A post on X, formerly known as Twitter, puts two videos side by side. In one, a man lies seriously injured in a hospital bed with two other men at his side. In the other, a man is talking into a camera while walking through wreckage after an attack in Gaza. The post claims the videos show the same man, with the one in the hospital taken a day earlier. Palestinian blogger miraculously healed in one day from Israeli bombing. Yesterday, he was hospitalized, today, he is walking and walking like nothing happened, reads the post on X, with more than 9,000 likes. But the videos show two different people and the hospital video predates the latest IsraelHamas war. The video of the man speaking to the camera is Saleh Aljafarawi, from Gaza. Aljafarawi posted the original video on Oct. 25 to his Instagram account. More than 30 missiles landed in front of my eyes, he wrote in the caption with the video. Aljafarawi didnt respond to the APs request for comment. Aljafarawi also has a YouTube channel where he describes himself a Palestinian living in Gaza. The video of the young man in the hospital bed had been online at least August with the earliest version available posted on Aug. 18, 2023, on TikTok. Another video from a different angle was shared a day earlier on TikTok. One of the hashtags from the Aug. 18 video reads, NourShamsCamp, which is a refugee camp located in the West Bank. An Aug. 25 report from the International Solidarity Movement, a Palestinianled group, shows a photo of the same man in the hospital video. The report identifies him as 16yearold Mohammed Zendiq, whose leg was amputated at the hospital after he was injured during July 24 clashes at the camp. Other outlets reported on the events at the time. Associated Press writer Karena Phan in Los Angeles contributed this report. CLAIM A video shows a large number of U.S. Marines arriving at an airport in Israel amid the latest IsraelHamas war. THE FACTS The video is from 2022 and shows soldiers from the U.S. Armys 101st Airborne Division arriving in Romania. The footage shows soldiers dressed in fatigues getting off of a plane at night, carrying their belongings and walking across the tarmac. One post with the video on X, formerly known as Twitter, had more than 9,000 likes with text that reads HAPPENING NOW Thousands of U.S. Marines Just Landed in Israel WW3 HIGH ALERT However the video doesnt show Marines nor Israel, and it isnt recent. The original can be found on the Defense Departments media distribution website, which says it shows U.S. Army soldiers arriving in Romania in June last year. 101st Airborne Division Air Assault Soldiers arrive in Mihail Kogainiceani, Romania, June 28, 2022, reads the videos description. The site says the unit was there to reinforce NATOs eastern flank and conduct multinational exercises with allies across Europe. Hours after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, the U.S. did begin moving warships and aircrafts to the region. In an interview on 60 Minutes that aired Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris said the U.S. has no intention to send combat troops into Israel or Gaza. Karena Phan. CLAIM A major mosque in Iran raised a black flag to call Muslims to war over Israels attacks on Gaza. THE FACTS The Imam Reza shrine said the flag was raised as a symbol of mourning for the lives lost in Israels strikes on Gaza. Experts on Islam and Iran confirmed the flag includes a passage from the Quran that is meant to comfort Muslims that their sacrifices will one day be rewarded. Social media users are sharing the false claim alongside images and videos of the distinctive gold dome of the shrine a major pilgrimage site for Shiite Muslims in Irans northeast that includes a mosque, library and other institutions with a black banner flying on a flagpole. BREAKING The Black Flag has been raised over Razavi Shrine in Mashhad, Khorasan province, Iran, wrote one Facebook user who shared the image on Oct. 18, using an alternate name for the complex. This is a call for war or vengeance. Others claimed the black flag and its Farsi inscription was meant to herald the coming of the Mahdi, the final leader believed to appear at the end of times to lead Muslim people. But the black flag isnt a call for war, and neither the flags text nor the shrines statement about the banner references the coming of the Mahdi or the end of time. In fact, an announcement on the shrines Englishlanguage Facebook page on Oct. 17 specifically describes it as a mourning flag that was raised in response to the deadly blast that rocked a hospital in Hamascontrolled Gaza that day. In an unprecedented gesture and by the order of the custodian of Astan Quds Razavi, the black flag has been hoisted above the illuminated and pure Razavi dome, and drum beating will not be played tomorrow, the post said, including sorrow mourning sadness grief and other hashtags. Islamic and Iranian experts confirmed the flag includes a line from the Quran roughly translated as help from Allah and an imminent victory or conquest from Allah and victory is near. That phrase isnt traditionally used to declare war, but meant to bring comfort and hope to those struggling or engaged in battle that their sacrifice is not in vain and that Allah will grant them victory eventually, they said. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian Studies at Columbia University in New York, said the Quranic verse, in the context of the shrines Facebook post, means solidarity with the Palestinian cause and not an outright declaration of war against Israel. To me it says nothing more than the obvious the ruling government in Iran supports Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, he wrote in an email. Nothing more, nothing less. The Middle East Media Research Institute, a Washingtonbased think tank founded by Israeli analysts, agreed, noting that Islamic militants tend to use a different passage from the Quran when declaring war. The organization noted that statements from the Iranbacked Iraqi militias claiming responsibility for recent attacks on U.S. bases in Syria and Iraq open with this Quranic verse Permission to fight is given to those upon whom war is made because they are oppressed, and most surely Allah is well able to grant them victory. Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo in New York contributed this report. CLAIM A video shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un saying in a speech that he blames President Joe Biden for the latest IsraelHamas war. THE FACTS The video is from 2020 and the version currently circulating online features incorrect English captions. The footage actually shows Kim celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean Workers Party he doesnt reference the conflict in the Middle East or Biden at any point. In the misleading video circulating online, the English captions claim Kim says Under the Biden administration, conflicts erupt yearly. This year a war begins between Israel and Palestine. Im afraid that if the Biden admin does not cease to exist in the next election, World War 3 may begin, the captions continue. Who knows what next years war will be. I support Donald Trump for President in 2024. Good Luck to Mr. Trump. The video was shared on Instagram and TikTok, where one post garnered more than 223,000 likes. However, the video is old and the captions are completely inaccurate. Clips and images from the same speech can be seen in news reports from October 2020 about an event celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Korean Workers Party. A transcript of the full speech translated to English by The National Committee on North Korea, a U.S.based organization, does not mention anything about the IsraelHamas war nor the 2024 U.S. presidential race. Multiple Korean speakers and an expert who reviewed the portion of the speech circulating online also confirmed Kim says nothing of the sort in the footage. Instead, Kim thanks his people and his military, saying The patriotic and heroic commitment shown by our Peoples Army soldiers on the unexpected frontlines of epidemic prevention and natural disaster recovery this year is something that evokes tears of gratitude from everyone. JiYoung Lee, a professor of Korean Studies at American University who confirmed the captions are inaccurate, noted that the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas militants did create concerns in South Korea about a similar assault from the North. Karena Phan. CLAIM The Israeli military confirmed it bombed a hospital in Gaza in a social media post written in Arabic. THE FACTS A screenshot circulating online shows a Facebook post from an account posing as the Israeli military. No such post exists on the militarys actual social media pages and its top Arabicspeaking spokesperson confirmed his office has issued no such statement. In the wake of the Oct. 17 deadly blast at alAhli hospital in Gaza, social media users shared the screenshot, claiming it is from a member of the Israeli militarys Arabicspeaking media relations team. The users profile image bears the blueandwhite emblem of the spokespersons office, which features radio waves atop the Israeli militarys traditional symbol of an olive branchwrapped sword. The post, written in Arabic, suggests the Jewish nation said it bombed the hospital because the Gaza City medical facility lacked supplies and staff. Israeli official facebook post Due to the lack of medical equipment and the lack of medical staff, it was decided to bomb the Baptist Hospital in Gaza and give them euthanasia, wrote one user on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, in a post translating the screenshot. Similar posts were also widely shared on TikTok and other social media platforms. But the purported statement wasnt penned by the Israeli militarys press office, its top Arabicspeaking spokesperson confirmed this week. Just to clarify I did not issue any statement or comment regarding the Baptist Hospital in Gaza, wrote Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab media branch of the Israeli militarys Spokespersons Unit, in a post on X from Oct. 17, when the blast occurred. All the news circulating in my name comes from the Hamas media outlets and is completely false. The office on Oct. 19 confirmed the post did not come from the militarys official Arabic page, saying in an emailed statement The IDF has made it very clear that there was no IDF strike on the hospital. Whats more, the Israeli militarys press office doesnt use its own logo on its actual social media accounts, unlike the fake account. The units separate Facebook pages in English and Hebrew, as well as its X account written in Farsi, for example, all use the militarys main symbol. That goldcolored emblem features the olive branchwrapped sword with the Star of David in the background. Meanwhile Adraees social media accounts, which are the main channel for the Israeli militarys messages in Arabic, feature his profile picture and a maroonlogo consisting of five swords with flames in the background as its cover photo. The original fake account and post on Facebook also appear to have been deleted as of Oct. 19. Spokespersons for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, didnt reply to an email seeking comment. There were conflicting accusations of who was responsible for the hospital blast, with Hamas officials in Gaza blaming an Israeli airstrike and Israel saying it was caused by a an errant rocket launched by Palestinian militants. U.S. and French intelligence services also concluded it was likely caused by a misfired rocket. An AP analysis of video, photos and satellite imagery, as well as consultation with experts, showed the cause was likely a rocket launched from Palestinian territory that misfired in the air and crashed to the ground. However, a definitive conclusion could not be reached. Philip Marcelo. CLAIM A video shows Qatars emir threatening to cut off the worlds natural gas supply if Israel doesnt stop bombing Gaza. THE FACTS Qatars ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, says no such thing in the widely circulating clip, which is more than 6 years old. A spokesperson for the Qatari government also confirmed that neither the emir nor any other government official has threatened to cut off exports in response to the conflict. Many online are sharing the video of the Persian Gulf nations ruler, falsely claiming it shows him saying in Arabic that hes willing to halt the distribution of its gas reserves to achieve his desired end to the latest IsraelHamas war. BREAKING Qatar is threatening to create a global gas shortage in support of Palestine, wrote one user who posted the video on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. If the bombing of Gaza doesnt stop, we will stop gas supply of the world. But Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani says nothing of the sort in the video. The 7second clip is actually a tiny snippet from his opening speech at the Doha Forum in 2017. Marc Owen Jones, a professor of Middle East studies at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Doha, the capital of Qatar, confirmed that the emir touches briefly on Palestinians in the widely shared clip, but doesnt make any threats related to the current conflict. Instead the emir, in his remarks, urged the international community to take more steps to address the regions refugee crisis, news outlets reported at the time. The exact translation is The issue of Palestine, Ill begin by saying its a case of a people uprooted from their lands, and displaced from their nation, Jones wrote in an email. Qatars government on Oct. 16 confirmed the clip dates to 2017 and is being misrepresented. This is yet another case of an online disinformation against Qatar such a statement has never been made and never would be, wrote the countrys International Media Office in an email. Qatar does not politicize its LNG supplies or any economic investment. Qatar is one of the worlds top natural gas producers. It controlled the thirdlargest natural gas reserves and was the second largest exporter of liquified natural gas, or LNG, in 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Whats more, the country has been working in recent years to use its sizable resources to build ties with other nations, not antagonize them, according to experts. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a Bostonbased company that tracks gas prices nationwide, pointed to a deal Qatars state energy company just announced to supply French energy company TotalEnergies with 3.5 million tons of natural gas annually for the next 27 years. Qatar has been securing investment since Russias invasion of Ukraine pushed Europe to find new sources of natural gas and quickly, he wrote in an email. Theyre making deals left and right. Philip Marcelo. CLAIM A video shows a BBC News report confirming Ukraine provided weapons to Hamas. THE FACTS The widely shared video clip is fabricated, officials with the BBC and Bellingcat, an investigative news website that is cited in the video as the source, confirm. The clip, which includes the BBCs distinctive blocktext logo, purports to show a story from the outlet about a recent report from Bellingcat on Ukraine providing arms to Hamas. Bellingcat Ukrainian military offensive failure and HAMAS attack linked, reads the text over the video, which has more than 2,500 comments and 110,000 views on the messaging service Telegram. The Palestinians purchased firearms, ammunition, drones and other weapons. But neither the BBC nor Bellingcat has reported any evidence to support the notion that Ukraine funneled arms to Hamas. Weve reached no such conclusions or made any such claims, Bellingcat wrote Oct. 10 in a post on X that included screengrabs of the fake report. Wed like to stress that this is a fabrication and should be treated accordingly. Eliot Higgins, the Amsterdambased organizations founder, noted in a separate post on X that the claims have been amplified by Russian social media users. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a New York University professor briefly shown near the end of the video, also disputed the clips suggestion that hes said the U.S. might leave NATO if the arms claims prove true. Entirely fake. Never said that, the distinguished professor of risk engineering wrote in an email. Spokespersons for the BBC didnt respond to emails seeking comment, but Shayan Sardarizadeh, a reporter with the organizations fact checking unit, confirmed in a post on X that the video is not real. Ukrainian officials have similarly dismissed the notion that its countrys arms have somehow found their way to Hamas. The countrys military intelligence agency, in an Oct. 9 post on its official Facebook page, accused Russia of plotting a disinformation campaign around these claims. Experts say there is also no evidence of Hamas making any claims about receiving arms from Ukraine, nor would it make sense for Kyiv to provide them. I see no reason Ukraine would do this, said Michael OHanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Starting with the fact that Kiev is in the business of obtaining weapons and not giving them away. Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo in New York and Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed this report. CLAIM Video of a young actor being filmed lying in a pool of fake blood shows propaganda being created for use in the IsraelHamas war. THE FACTS The video is behindthescenes footage from the making of Empty Place, a short film focused on the story of Ahmad Manasra, a Palestinian who was arrested at age 13 in 2015 in relation to the stabbing of two Israelis. Social media users on both sides of the latest IsraelHamas war are sharing the video, each falsely alleging that its proof the other group is creating propaganda about their own. In the clip, a young actor lies on a sidewalk covered in fake blood, his right leg bent backward, as a film crew works around him. Other actors mill about dressed as soldiers and in garb worn by many Orthodox Jewish men. See how Israelis are making fake videos saying that Palestine Freedom Fighters killed children, reads one tweet that had received more than 5,600 likes and more than 4,400 shares as of Oct. 11. An Instagram post claimed the opposite, stating These terrorists are dressing up as JEWISH soldiers to create fake videos about Israeli soldiers Faking Propaganda But neither allegation is correct. The video shows footage from the making of the 2022 short film directed by Awni Eshtaiwe, a filmmaker based in the West Bank. The scene being shot begins about 1 minute and 10 seconds into the approximately 2 minute film. Mohamad Awawdeh, a cinematographer listed in the films credits as a camera assistant, posted the behindthescenes footage to TikTok in April 2022, around the time the film was released. A caption on the post, written in Arabic, explains that the scene being filmed in the video shows Manasra being attacked. Awawdeh posted the same footage to Instagram on June 30. Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin in New York contributed this report. CLAIM Nimrod Aloni, a top general in the Israeli army, was captured by Hamas militants during a deadly incursion Oct. 7 into southern Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip. THE FACTS Theres no truth to this claim, a spokesperson for the Israeli military confirmed. Aloni was seen Oct. 8 at a meeting of top Israeli military officials. The erroneous claim that Aloni was one of the hostages taken by Hamas spread widely online after the militant group attacked Israel. Palestinian resistance fighters capture Israeli commander Nimrod Aloni along with dozens of other Israeli soldiers as the resistance fighters attacked neighbouring occupied towns and Israeli check posts near Gaza, stated one Instagram post that received more than 43,000 likes. But Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli militarys chief military spokesman, told reporters Oct. 7 that claims Aloni was captured are not true. Aloni clearly appears 10 seconds into a video posted to the Israeli militarys official YouTube channel of top officials discussing the war on Oct. 8. The date can be seen on a slide in the background. The military also published online four images from the meeting. The one on the lower right shows Aloni on the far right. The Israeli army confirmed to The Associated Press that Aloni is the man in the video and image. Melissa Goldin. CLAIM A video shows Hamas fighters parachuting onto a sports field before attacking Israeli citizens during the groups surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel. THE FACTS While Hamas did employ paragliders to get some fighters across the border between Gaza and southern Israel, the footage of the sports field shows parachute jumpers in Cairo and has been online since at least September. The clip shows people strapped to multicolored parachutes descending onto a crowded sports field complex filled with children and families, many in red sports jerseys. Hamas paraglided amongst Israeli citizens and proceeded to massacre them, text on the video clip reads. One post of the misleading footage on TikTok was viewed more than 38,000 times. But this footage has been online since at least Sept. 27, when it was posted to TikTok with the location tag Egypt. Details of the video also point to Egypt as the location a person is wearing a blue shirt that reads El Nasr SC on the back, the name of a sporting club in northeastern Cairo. Images of the club on Google Maps match the scene of the video as well as several other clips of the event from the same TikTok user with both showing a bright blue fence around a sporting ground next to a paved area with green and blue plastic seats. The parachuters land on a larger soccer pitch surrounded by tall field lights. The field matches photos posted to the clubs Facebook page and footage of its soccer teams matches, including a distinctive red building with a blue fence on top at one end that can be seen in the TikTok clip at around 19 seconds. Other TikTok users shared footage of a parachuting similar scene around the same time, with El Nasr in the caption in Arabic. The crowd of onlookers in the clip circulating online also doesnt seem distressed by the arrival of the parachuters, as one might expect if they were an invading force. In fact, many women and children are seen running towards them, phones in hand taking videos and photos of the aerial display. CLAIM Two videos show Russian President Vladimir Putin warning the U.S. to stay away from the latest IsraelHamas war. THE FACTS Bothvideos circulating online are monthsold clips of Putin speaking about the RussiaUkraine war, not the conflict in the Middle East, which have been miscaptioned in English. Both videos show Putin speaking in Russian, with false English captions saying he was warning the U.S. to refrain from helping the Jewish state. America wants to Destroy israel as we destroy ukraine In past, the captions on one video state. I am warning America. Russia will help palestine and america can do nothing. One TikTok post that shared the clip had received approximately 11,600 views as of Oct. 9. A caption on another video of Putin, filmed in a different location, similarly reads I am warning america to stay Away from palestine israel war. But the two clips long predate the latest IsraelHamas war and make no mention of Israel at all. The first shows Putin at a meeting of Russias Human Rights Council in December 2022, where, amid discussions about the war in Ukraine, he responded to a question about the countrys potential use of nuclear weapons, as the AP reported at the time. The footage was featured by multiple other newsoutlets with similar translations. In the second, Putin is speaking at a February 2023 event marking the 80th anniversary of the World War II Soviet victory over Nazi German forces in the battle of Stalingrad. In his remarks, he compared this threat to Germanys thenrecent decision to supply Ukraine with tanks, the AP reported at the time. Several media outlets also featured the footage in similar reports. In reality, Putin has condemned the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on towns in southern Israel while also warning Israel against blockading the Gaza Strip. He has cast the war as a failure of U.S. peacemaking efforts, accusing Washington of opting for economic handouts to the Palestinians while abandoning efforts to help create a Palestinian state.

The fourth week of the criminal trial for organizers Tamara Lich and Chris Barber has been dedicated to hearing from Ottawa residents who lived or worked downtown during the protest. On Friday the court heard from the person responsible for rerouting public transit routes and the owner of an upscale boutique in Ottawas ByWard Market. I saw our streets, I saw our city seized and completely overtaken by these socalled protesters, Chantal Biro told the court. She said there were far fewer customers at her store and a dramatic drop in sales when thousands of protesters arrived in Ottawa early last year to protest COVID19 public health restrictions. The streets near Biros shop were blocked by bigrigs and pickup trucks that blared their horns. She recalled the smell of exhaust fumes from constantly running vehicles, and marijuana and cigarette smoke seeping into the stop. She said she wasnt able to get shipments delivered to the store, but was able to drive to her usual parking garage and walk to the store seven days each week. She avoided being outside because of unpleasant runins with some of the demonstrators, who mocked her for wearing a mask and swore at her when she asked them to move away from the doorway of her business. None of the local witnesses the court heard from this week had any contact with Lich or Barber, who are both accused of mischief and counselling others to commit mischief, among other charges. The blocked streets also impacted public transit routes through the core, OC Transpos Natalie Huneault testified Friday. Huneault is responsible for planning detours to accommodate events and demonstrations that disrupt bus service in Ottawa. She told the court she redirected 18 routes that usually run through the downtown core. That meant about 150 downtown bus stops were not in use during the demonstration because streets were blocked and closed. Instead, OC Transpo arranged for an extraordinary shuttle bus to pick up residents. Before the convoy arrived, she said the event that caused the longest transit disruption was Italian Fest, which lasted three days. The convoy disruptions lasted more than three weeks. Barbers lawyer, Marwa Younes, reminded the court that other things have led to longer delays, including construction and road closures. Friday was scheduled to be the final day of the criminal trial, but it is now expected to continue for several more weeks. There are still several names on the Crowns list of witnesses, including Zexi Li, the lead plaintiff in a proposed classaction lawsuit against the organizers on behalf of people who live and work in downtown Ottawa. Biro told the court that she has taken steps to join that class action on behalf of her business. The court also expects to hear from police officers who were responsible for liaising with protesters. Before court adjourned Friday, the lawyers discussed some of the challenges in scheduling more time for the trial and the disclosure of evidence to the defence before more police officers take the stand. Barbers other lawyer, Diane Magas, raised the issue of timing. The Supreme Courts Jordan decision stipulates that any person charged with a crime has the right to be tried within a reasonable time frame, which the court has ruled to be 18 months. Jordan is very much an issue in this case, at this time, Magas said. The trial is expected to resume Monday. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 13, 2023.|1

The flooding damaged the facilitys underground electrical and mechanical infrastructure. At the time, the citys Director of Leisure Services, Andrew Crowe, said they would be looking at all of the options to prevent a similar thing from happening. To help explore those options, HDA Engineering was brought in to look at the facilities, and make recommendations for the current system and provide a recommendation on the best path forward. The firm noted the best course of action would be the installation of a sanitary sewer backflow preventer, and in July a call for tender was posted. Dons Plumbing and Heating, from Weyburn, submitted the winning tender and will start the work in the coming weeks. We will be installing a backflow preventer on the sanitary sewer that connects to the building, in the front lawn of the Weyburn Leisure Centre, explained Crowe about the project. Youll start to see work there. Theyre going to have to dig a manhole and do some work on the exterior of the building, and the interior of the building as well. The work itself isnt expected to have any impacts on the use of the facility itself, Crowe stated. There will be a construction zone on the front lawn of the facility, but there will still be access to go in. The 2023 budget did have 35,000 set aside for the work to be done, but the money was budgeted before the recommendations were made. The final price tag is now expected to come in at 72,927, but it wont be considered a budget overage. What weve done is we split the project over two years, Crowe explained. The first portion will happen in the fall here, and then in 2024, we have some more costs that will incur in the winter and early spring to take care of the final steps. The timeline for the work has not been set at this time, but the upgrades are expected to be completed early next year.

To fulfil that recommendation, MNRF will be leading the flood strategy commitment to establish a provincial urban flooding work group, Rolf von den BaumenClark told the committee. NDP climate critic Peter Tabuns asked when the working group would be convened and when it would start writing reports. I dont know what the Urban Flooding Working Group is Are we developing an Urban Flooding Policy|After a yearslong backandforth, the provincial government has now convened an urban flooding working group EDITORS NOTE A version of this article originally appeared on The Trillium, a new Village Media website devoted to covering provincial politics at Queens Park. In April, Ontario promised to create a working group on flooding. In June, the responsible ministers office appeared to have never heard of it. But yes as of October, it does exist, the ministry now confirms. Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry MNRF thendeputy minister Monique Rolf von den BaumenClark made the pledge on April 3, saying her ministry would take the lead on an intragovernmental working group to address urban flooding. The group was to be a response to the auditor generals 2022 report, which found a lack of leadership on the file. In a legislative committee discussing the AG report, Rolf von den BaumenClark said the group would be made up of the Ministries of Natural Resources and Forestry, Environment, Conservation and Parks, Municipal Affairs and Housing, Infrastructure and Transportation, and some municipalities. It would identify roles and responsibilities related to urban flooding, determine new or emerging urban flooding issues and develop a provincial framework for urban flooding policy, she said. To fulfil that recommendation, MNRF will be leading the flood strategy commitment to establish a provincial urban flooding work group, Rolf von den BaumenClark told the committee. NDP climate critic Peter Tabuns asked when the working group would be convened and when it would start writing reports. Rolf von den BaumenClark initially refused to offer a timeline but said, We will start this year, after Tabuns pressed her. Just two months later, the ministers top policy staffer appeared not to have heard of the project. According to internal emails received through a freedomofinformation request, a ministry staffer contacted several employees in Natural Resources and Forestry Minister Graydon Smiths office on June 1. She was looking for approval to get back to the legislative committee with a more specific timeline. Proposed Answer The provincial urban flooding working group will be established this summer, with deliberations to be held through this fall and winter and a final frameworkreport to be completed in the spring of 2024, the ministry staffer wrote. A response came the next morning from Smiths director of policy, Matthew Stubbings. I dont know what the Urban Flooding Working Group is he wrote. Are we developing an Urban Flooding Policy Please advice. sic A couple of hours later, Stubbings asked the ministry to tone down its proposed committee answer because Smith and his staff didnt know enough about the group. I dont think we offer any time commitments without the ministers office and minister being briefed on this groups terms of reference and broader policy objectives, he wrote. I propose we change the language to something like the... Ministry will be considering establishing a working group in the coming months... On Thursday, ministry spokesperson Richard Mullin said the group has been established and will indeed meet this fall. Ontarios 2020 flooding strategy pledged to establish a working group with provincial agencies to identify custodians for flood mapping information, including base data, with clear roles and responsibilities. In the auditor generals report, she notes that the ministry had drafted terms of reference and invitations to participate in the group back in 2020, following a report from a Special Advisor on Flooding that recommended its creation but it still hadnt been created as of 2022. The province is well aware of the need to do more to address this issue, thenauditor general Bonnie Lysyk wrote, noting that four reports and plans had made recommendations. Yet the province has never clarified provincial roles for addressing and coordinating actions needed to alleviate the risk of urban flooding, with the result that gaps in responsibility persist and actions and commitments have never been implemented. The government seemed to backtrack on its plan to create a flood group after Lysyks report. Four ministries told her theyd work within their own mandates on flooding, but none agreed to develop a provincial framework that clearly identifies and assigns roles and responsibilities for urban flood management, Lysyk wrote. Floodprone communities have called for more help from higher levels of government, singling out the siloed nature of support. Some say governments could learn something from the Americans, whose Army Corps of Engineers is creating a plan to protect the shorelines of eight states along the Great Lakes. Thenenvironment minister David Piccini promised in August to call on the feds to create a similar plan. He also said there would be an announcement from Ottawa on that front in the fall, but the feds said they werent sure what he was talking about.|1

According to Kerry Sleeper, senior adviser for the SCN, potential threats can come from different directions, such as nonviolent protests or demonstrations that turn violent, which may be centered on college campuses neoNazis and hate groups who are using the current atmos and lonewolf violent extremists who are inspired by Hamas to act.

Hurricanes, floods and wildfiresDisasters like hurricanes, floods and wildfires are slowermoving. Donaldson stresses that whatever the emergency situation, its wise to plan in advance for what you might need after disaster strikes. who returned after evacuating amid the wildfires in August know better than most whats needed in a disaster.|From record flooding in Nova Scotia to wildfires across Canada that forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes, its been an unprecedented year for environmental disruption. Statistics Canada says natural disasters and extreme weather events are increasing in severity and frequency and are affecting Canadians and businesses on many fronts. But Statscan also reports only a quarter of Canadians say theyve taken steps to prepare for a weatherrelated emergency. So CBCs Marketplace travelled across the country to put together a survival guide to deal with natural disasters. Got a tip you think we should investigate Reach us at marketplacecbc.ca Jeff Donaldson, principal researcher at Preparedness Labs Inc., an Ottawabased consultancy, says Canadians dont need an individual plan for each disaster. Instead, he says, we should prepare for the most likely scenario a power outage while also making plans for a potential evacuation. If you plan for the extremities of the continuum, youre more than likely to be ready for anything that may happen in the middle, said Donaldson. Tornadoes and earthquakes Preliminary data suggests that tornadoes will become more frequent in heavily populated areas in Ontario and Quebec , says Dave Sills, a former tornado investigator for Environment Canada. Now the executive director of the Northern Tornadoes Project at Western University in London, Ont., Sills says the most dangerous aspects of a tornado are structures collapsing and debris flying, which is why he says the best advice is to protect your head and body from being hit. WATCH Inside a tornado simulator Inside a tornado simulator Duration 055 Featured Video At the WindEEE Research Institute in London, Ont., Marketplace host Travis Dhanraj experiences a simulation measuring how tornadoes could impact our homes. The ideal way to protect yourself is to get to a safe place in your home, like the basement or inside a room on the lowest floor without windows, to shield yourself from broken glass. Sills warns that you should close all windows and doors in a tornado, and as hard as it may be to resist, not to stand at your window to take a video of the storm. Lawn chairs and lawn furniture these are projectiles in a big storm, he said, emphasizing that even in weak tornadoes, planks of wood can pierce walls. If youre in a car, Sills advises you pull over, ensure your seatbelts are buckled and duck as low as you can, covering your head. If youre outside, he says to go to a ditch if you can, squat down and cover your head. Sills notes theres likely to be lightning in a tornado, so use this position to limit contact with the ground and reduce the risk of being struck. WATCH What to do and what not to do when an earthquake hits What to do and what not to do when an earthquake hits Duration 100 Featured Video Marketplaces Charlsie Agro experiences a highmagnitude earthquake simulation to demonstrate what to do in an emergency. In some situations, you might have even less time to react. During an earthquake, for example, there could be only a few seconds between the time it hits and the time you feel it. The instinct may be to run, but in a big earthquake, you wont be able to. The Government of B.C. says crawling under a sturdy table can protect you from falling debris. Hurricanes, floods and wildfires Disasters like hurricanes, floods and wildfires are slowermoving. The Government of Canada says the best thing you can do to deal with these threats is to be alert to whats going on near your home by following reports on radio, TV or online and listen to authorities. Donaldson stresses that whatever the emergency situation, its wise to plan in advance for what you might need after disaster strikes. Depending on the situation, you will have one of two options sheltering in place or evacuating. The first step in planning is defining your family and their specific needs. Consider those who live in the same residence, as well as extended family members nearby who are likely to call on you in times of chaos, said Donaldson. Dont forget your pets, either. Donaldson recommends planning for three to 14 days without power or utilities. Theres no guarantee that a public shelter will be available to feed, water and house you after the initial 72 hours, he said. After Hurricane Fiona tore through Nova Scotia in 2022, regions of the province were without power for more than six days. Parts of P.E.I. were without power for more than two weeks. Donaldson says to stock up on water, food and a way to cook it. Nonperishable food on hand is important, but do you really wanna be doing that for seven or 14 days straight he said. A warm cup of tea, a warm cup of coffee makes a difference to everybody. Its rare, but there may be circumstances where you or your family will need to leave your home. The unprecedented wildfires in the Northwest Territories this summer saw more than 25,000 people evacuate from their homes for weeks. WATCH Lessons learned from Yellowknife evacuees Lessons learned from Yellowknife evacuees Duration 055 Featured Video In Yellowknife, residents share their experiences of the wildfire evacuation this summer, with tips for other Canadians who may go through it themselves. Extreme flooding, hurricanes and chemical spills have also led to evacuations in Canada, and could happen again. Now we know what to do Donaldson stresses the importance of a go bag a single, prepacked bag you can grab quickly that contains your most vital items. Those include primary documents like passports, SIN cards, health cards and wills, as well as car, household and life insurance documentation and contact information. The go bag should also contain items that you deem priceless, as well as suitable and comfortable seasonal clothing for your family. Donaldson advises bringing things for entertainment and comfort to lower peoples stress levels, especially if youre evacuating with children. People in N.W.T. who returned after evacuating amid the wildfires in August know better than most whats needed in a disaster. Yellowknife resident Kinjal Photavala said that weeks later, she still has her bag of documents packed. Now we know what to do, now we know how to do it better I hope it never happens again, but even if it happens, we are ready.

Les villes les plus risque, sur le plan fiscal, sont plus petites, plus denses, plus riches et plus blanches. linverse, les villes les moins risque sont plus peuples, plus diversifies, aux revenus plus faibles et au territoire plus vaste. Nous ne considrons pas ce rsultat comme tant invitable, en Floride comme ailleurs.|Les changements climatiques affectent des communauts un peu partout sur la plante, mais la Floride, aux tatsUnis, semblent souvent tre lavantplan de ces transformations. Selon une nouvelle tude, des chercheurs affirment que ces catastrophes ont un impact croissant sur les revenus fiscaux des villes, qui sappuient largement sur les taxes foncires, empchant peu peu ces municipalits de payer les cots de ladaptation climatique. Selon ce que rappellent les chercheurs, originaires des Universits Cornell et dtat de la Floride, en septembre de lan dernier, louragan Ian a ravag le sudouest de la Floride, tuant au moins 156 personnes et entranant au moins 113 milliards de dollars amricains en dgts. Puis, louragan Idalia a frapp la rgion floridienne appele Panhandle, en septembre de cette anne, en plus dune superlune qui a aussi augment la force des inondations lies aux mares, dans le sudest de ltat. Les communauts peuvent sadapter certains de ces effets, ou au moins gagner du temps, crivent les spcialistes, en adoptant certaines politiques, comme le fait de moderniser les systmes de gestion des eaux de temptes, en plus de surlever les routes et les trottoirs. Mais les catastrophes climatiques et laugmentation du niveau de la mer nuisent aussi aux gouvernements, sur le plan fiscal, en faisant crotre les cots et en rduisant la base fiscale des villes. Pire encore, cette dpendance envers les taxes foncires pourrait dcourager les gouvernements locaux de cesser les dveloppements immobiliers dans les zones inondables, ce qui, affirmeton, est essentiel pour rduire les risques long terme. Dans le cadre de leur tude, les chercheurs ont constat que plus de la moiti des 410 villes de Floride seraient affectes par une hausse du niveau de la mer de lordre denviron deux mtres. Prs de 30 de tous les revenus locaux de ces 211 municipalits proviennent de btiments construits dans des zones qui seront trs largement inondes, potentiellement dici la fin du sicle. Malgr tout, affirmeton, les planificateurs urbains et les lus ignorent largement quel point la crise climatique affectera la sant fiscale lchelle municipale. Pire encore, indiquent les auteurs de ltude, certaines des communauts les plus risques sont parmi celles qui en font le moins pour se prparer. Le pige des taxes foncires Si les taxes foncires reprsentent 30 des revenus des villes, aux tatsUnis, en plus dtre le levier fiscal sur lequel les municipalits ont le plus de contrle, cest aussi une source dargent qui est directement menace par les catastrophes climatiques. Avec le rchauffement des ocans, les ouragans sont plus froces et se rendent plus loin lintrieur des terres ou le long des ctes. La crise climatique fait aussi augmenter le niveau des mers, ce qui fait augmenter les inondations ctires pendant les temptes et les mares hautes. Contrairement aux temptes, les hausses du niveau des ocans ne sinversent pas il sagit de la menace dune inondation permanente des terres ctires, avec le temps qui passe, mentionnent les auteurs des travaux. Sans compter les impacts physiques de la crise, la valeur foncire des proprits risque peut diminuer en raison dun dclassement des marchs immobiliers, ou encore dune hausse marque des frais dassurance, quand les compagnies ne refusent pas carrment dassurer ces proprits trop souvent menaces par les lments. Ce phnomne prend dailleurs dj de lampleur. Et dans ce cas, difficile, voire impossible de vendre son domicile pour stablir ailleurs qui voudrait acheter une maison qui pourrait tre emporte par locan dchan ou rendue inhabitable Et ces mmes impacts climatiques font monter la facture des services publics, comme leau courante, les gouts et lentretien des routes. Par exemple, liton dans ltude, la chaleur fait gondoler la chausse, les inondations emportent les infrastructures, et les trs fortes pluies poussent les rseaux dgout leur limite. Si les villes ne sadaptent pas, laccroissement des dgts provoqus par les catastrophes climatiques et laugmentation du niveau de la mer creront un cycle fiscal vicieux, en sapant la base fiscale et en faisant bondir le cot des services, ce qui, son tour, laissera encore moins dargent disponible pour ladaptation , crivent les chercheurs. Cependant, si les villes rduisent le dveloppement dans les zones risque, leurs taxes foncires et dautres revenus seront rduits. Et sils construisent davantage de murailles ctires et de maison blindes pour rsister aux ouragans et aux temptes, cela poussera plus de gens vivre dans des endroits dangereux, ajoutentils. Les revenus locaux risque Toujours selon les chercheurs, en vertu du scnario examin, des inondations pourraient toucher des proprits possdant une valeur combine de 619 milliards de dollars US, et qui gnrent des taxes foncires de lordre de 2,36 milliards par an. Cinq millions de Floridiens vivent dans des villes o au moins 10 des revenus locaux proviennent de zones risque lev dinondations chroniques et permanentes. Pire encore, pour 64 villes examines, 50 de leurs revenus proviennent de telles zones. Et de lavis des auteurs de ltude, les vritables effets fiscaux seraient probablement pires, aprs avoir tenu compte dautres revenus perdus, de la hausse des dpenses et des impacts de nombreux dangers climatiques, comme une temprature plus chaude et des ouragans plus intenses. Ces impacts ne sont dailleurs pas rpartis de faon quitable sur le territoire de cet tat du sud des tatsUnis. Les villes les plus risque, sur le plan fiscal, sont plus petites, plus denses, plus riches et plus blanches. linverse, les villes les moins risque sont plus peuples, plus diversifies, aux revenus plus faibles et au territoire plus vaste. La tte dans le sable De lavis des chercheurs, leurs conclusions sont un appel aux gouvernements locaux et tatique . Sans action urgente pour sadapter la crise climatique, des dizaines de municipalits pourraient se retrouver dans le rouge , affirmentils. Pourtant, plusieurs villes de Floride poursuivent des programmes de croissance via une expansion de leur infrastructure. Mme aprs des vnements dvastateurs comme louragan Iran, les limites administratives, les obligations en matire de services publics et les responsabilits budgtaires viennent compliquer la tche des leaders municipaux pour que ceuxci puissent faire une place pour leau, ou permettre aux citoyens de se relocaliser sur des terres surleves, liton dans ltude. Les scientifiques estiment que si la tendance favoriser la croissance et lexpansion se poursuit dans les villes ctires menaces, les rgions davantage situes lintrieur des terres, ainsi quen hauteur, comme St. Petersburg, Tampa et Miami, attireront davantage de dveloppements plus rsistants et de meilleure qualit, alors que les rsidents faibles revenus et membres des minorits ethniques devront soit quitter la rgion, ou vers les rgions ctires dont les ressources sont dj en dclin. Nous ne considrons pas ce rsultat comme tant invitable, en Floride comme ailleurs. Les villes ont des options pour grer leurs territoires afin de promouvoir des mthodes fiscalement justes, quitables et durables, afin de sadapter aux changements climatiques. La cl consiste reconnatre le pige fiscal et sy attaquer , affirment les spcialistes. Parmi les solutions, on suggre de diversifier les sources de revenus pour les villes, comme des taxes sur la consommation, sur les locaux inoccups, ou encore des frais associs aux impacts des temptes. Les petites villes sont aussi appeles faire cause commune et partager les revenus fiscaux, histoire de rduire les dveloppements dans les zones risque, tout en continuant dassurer les services pour leurs rsidents. Sloigner du modle de dveloppement traditionnel ne sera pas facile, mais notre tude dmontre que la Floride, avec son territoire plat et ses milliers de kilomtres de ctes, est menace par des impacts fiscaux en cascade si ltat poursuit sur sa voie actuelle , concluent les chercheurs.|1

Depuis 1985, le nombre dtablissements humains situs dans les zones inondables les plus risques a augment de 122 , contre 80 pour les zones les plus sres, selon une tude publie dans le numro de mercredi d revue Nature par des chercheurs de la Banque mondiale. Les auteurs ont examin ltendue et lexpansion des agglomrations en utilisant des satellites au lieu de la population. Les rgions bties du monde ont connu une croissance globale de 85 entre 1985 et 2015. Les gens sont la recherche dune vie meilleure et dun meilleur emploi, et se retrouvent coincs dans des terres dsoles parce que cest ce quils peuvent se permettre , a dclar Stphane Hallegatte, coauteur de ltude, conseiller principal de la Banque mondiale pour les questions climatiques et expert en conomie des catastrophes. Il ajoute quils savent que la situation est dangereuse lorsquils arrivent. Selon ltude, ce sont les pays faible et moyen revenu qui sont lorigine du problme. Les pays plus riches comme les EtatsUnis et certaines parties de lEurope connaissent une croissance plus importante dans les zones plus sres que dans les zones sujettes aux inondations, et les nations les plus pauvres ne se sont pas dveloppes aussi fortement dans les zones sujettes aux inondations. Chine et le Vit Nam ont tous deux vu ltendue de leurs tablissements humains plus que tripler au cours des 30 dernires annes, augmentant bien plus que la superficie de leurs terres arides. Dans la plupart des pays, en particulier en Asie de lEst, les zones dinondation normale et les zones dinondation trs importante ont t davantage colonises que les zones sches. La Libye, qui a souffert de dinondations dvastatrices le mois derniera enregistr une augmentation de 83 de ltendue de lhabitat dans les zones les plus touches par les inondations. Le Pakistan, galement victime dinondations catastrophiques lanne dernire et cette anne, a connu une augmentation de 89 . Ce qui se passe, cest que lorsquun pays devient un peu plus riche, il y a un changement de la campagne la ville et les gens quittent la campagne pour aller dans les villes, qui sont souvent prs des voies deau qui sont inondes par endroits, a dclar lauteur principal de ltude, Jun Rentschler, un conomiste de la Banque mondiale. Ce que nous essayons de faire avec cette tude, cest de suivre le processus de dveloppement urbain au fil du temps , a dclar M. Rentschler. On peut sattendre ce que, dans un premier temps, les habitants sinstallent dans un espace sr, mais au fur et mesure que la ville stend, il est plus probable quelle se dveloppe dans des zones quelle vitait auparavant, comme les zones inondables par exemple. Selon les auteurs de ltude, la question se pose alors de savoir sil est moins coteux de fortifier ces zones dangereuses ou sil vaut mieux en dloger les habitants. Dar Es Salaam, en Tanzanie, est une ville modle pour ce problme. Elle est passe dun village de pcheurs denviron 83 000 habitants en 1950 plus de 7 millions dhabitants aujourdhui. Revue de la population mondiale. En revanche, aux tatsUnis, les tablissements secs ont augment de 76 , tandis que les tablissements les plus inonds nont progress que de 46 . La France, la Sude, lAutriche, la Finlande, le Japon, le Canada et lInde sont dautres pays o les tablissements secs sont plus nombreux que les tablissements ultrahumides. Il sagit dun document important qui compile des donnes sur les zones dveloppes et les biens exposs aux inondations comme cela na jamais t fait auparavant , a dclar Klaus Jacob, climatologue luniversit de Columbia, qui na pas particip la recherche. Les donnes relatives la diffrenciation des pays en fonction du niveau de revenu sont particulirement importantes et fournissent des informations socioconomiques intressantes. Selon les auteurs de ltude, laugmentation des populations dans les zones inondables ne signifie pas que le changement climatique nest pas un problme majeur. En fait, les deux sont lis, a dclar M. Rentschler. Dans les deux cas, les pays les plus pauvres pourraient viter de tomber dans le mme pige que les pays revenus moyens, a dclar M. Hallegatte. En ce qui concerne le dveloppement urbain, une planification intelligente peut empcher certains dplacements vers les endroits les plus risqus, atil dit.

When Jerzy Hoffmanns film The Leper was first shown in cinemas in 1976, all the Polish women went crazy for the handsome and organized man Waldemar Michorowski. Meeting with Andrzej uawski was a great honor for the young Leszek Teleszyski. During his studies, Leszek Teleszyski became involved with his college girlfriend Alicja Jachiewicz, i.e. Soon after being cast by a Polish theater director as lovers in a play, they also became lovers in their private lives.|Ill be Teleszyski Born on May 21, 1947 in Krakow. In 1969, he graduated from the Krakow State Theater School, and made his stage debut with the role of Robert Faulconbridge in Drrenmatts play King John after Shakespeare, directed by Irina Babel. He played at the Peoples Theater in Nova Huta, the National Theater in Warsaw and the Polish Theater. As a film actor, he is primarily associated with the role of Bogusaw Radziwi the flood And coordinator Waldemar Mishorowski Th leper . It is to the director of these films, Jerzy Hoffmann, that Teleczynski owes his popularity. It was his films The Flood, in which I played the role of Bogusaw Radziwi, and, above all, The Leper, in which I played the orderly Waldemar Mishorowski that had a huge audience and gave me the greatest popular success, says the actor. When Jerzy Hoffmanns film The Leper was first shown in cinemas in 1976, all the Polish women went crazy for the handsome and organized man Waldemar Michorowski. Teleszyski then gained fame, notoriety and the admiration of women. However, the 30yearold actor was prepared for it beautiful women had lusted after him for years and did not hesitate to approach him on the street. Actor Henrik Talar recalled to his colleague We were walking in Krakow with Jurik Trella and Leszek and we heard women sighing Look, what a man. ideal. amazing. We had no doubt which of us aroused such feelings. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was one of the most beloved Polish actors among viewers. Even when he played villains, he was adorable and women fell madly in love with him He said I like to play villains. I try never to play with a thick black line, because it looks uninteresting to me. I always look for grey, anything in between, and try to give every character human characteristics. In one of the interviews In 1998, the actor began acting in this series Zlotopolsky In which he played Senator Jerzy Kowalski for 13 years. Unfortunately, when TVP decided to end production of the series, Teleszyski disappeared from the screens. We still see him in occasional appearances in Colors of Happiness, and he also appeared in small roles in two films Cursed and Na Uzim Ma Ive had a few breaks in my career, but apparently there hasnt always been a demand for an actor like me. I dont fight for roles, I dont fight for myself says Leszek Tyliczynski, when asked why I rarely It appears on small and large screens. . Directors often simply cast people they know, and Im not an actor who constantly reminds me of myself and is always on hand, says Telezinski. At the beginning of his career, he starred in two famous films Andrzej Zulawski who she remembers working with as hell, and the time she spent with him on set a stay in hell Meeting with Andrzej uawski was a great honor for the young Leszek Teleszyski. My friends from drama school were extras in Part Three of the Night , and uawski invited me to test pictures for the main role. I knew then that if I got this role, I would face a huge challenge. I wasnt wrong, the actor said years later. The Third Part of the Night takes place in Lviv during World War II, and in order to survive the German occupation, Teleszyskis hero gets a job as a lice feeder at the Weigl Institute. My hero was supposed to feed the lice, so he thought I should know what its like. I went to the institute in Gdynia. I had several thousand lice on my legs I was sitting and they were feeding on me said the actor in an interview with Rzeczpospolita . The neophyte was very afraid that he might contract typhus. Although he confirmed that all the lice were intact, he was given a vaccine to be on the safe side. He says I would rather get sick Giving the vaccine in the form of an oily liquid can only be compared to being beaten with an iron rod. 17 On Wednesday, January 4, 2017, it was exactly 45 years since the premiere of one of the most original performances in the history of Polish cinema The Third Part of the Night by Andrzej Sawski. The main roles in the film based on the war experiences of the directors father writer and diplomat Miroslaw uawski were played by Magorzata Braunek and Leszek Teleszyski. Source East NewsBulfilm A year after finishing filming The Third Part of the Night, Andrzej uawski began filming The Devil. The directors wife and she was then Malgorzata Brunek She insisted on involving Teleszyski. She didnt want to play with anyone else And only for this reason Leszek agreed to appear in the film The Devil and he quickly regretted it. This time, uawski sent the actor to a psychiatric hospital. I went to a psychiatric hospital in Torquay and locked myself in a schizophrenic room with no doorknobs, recalls Leszek Tiliczynski, who adds that Andrzej Zulawski had no mercy on anyone, not even his wife. Magosia Bronek had a nervous attack during the shooting. He wanted to get more and more emotions out of her, but it was not enough, he said. The film was so powerful that censorship did not allow it to be shown in cinemas. After the screening, a censor concluded that Polish viewers were not prepared to witness such experiments. The Devil has been on the shelf for 16 years During his studies, Leszek Teleszyski became involved with his college girlfriend Alicja Jachiewicz, i.e. Teresa Krasawska from The Poaniecki Family. They were the most beautiful couple in Krakow, and when they announced in the late 1960s that they were getting married, the whole city was waiting for their wedding. However, instead of leading his beloved to the altar, Leszek left her without a word of explanation picture Alicia Gaczewicz and Leszek Tyliczynski TZ East News East News East News Shortly thereafter, at the Polish theater he met Irina Szczurowska, an actress six years his senior, known primarily for her stage and television performances. He fell in love with her and she quickly returned his feelings. Soon after being cast by a Polish theater director as lovers in a play, they also became lovers in their private lives. Unfortunately, the actor and his beautiful lover could not flaunt their love because Irina was married. For several months, they hid that they had something more than just friendship, but finally the actresss husband discovered that his wife was flirting with him. Irina Szczorowskas marriage ended in a social scandal, because the man she cheated on was a widely known and respected writer, and one of the founders of the Student Satirical Theater, Jaroslaw Abramov Nyorli. At first, the writer decided to fight for his wife, but after a year of fierce fighting, he gave up and stopped standing in the way of the actors happiness. Teleszyski and Szczurowska married in 1976, and three years later, their daughter Karolina was born. Shortly after their child was born, the relationship they had fought so hard for began to deteriorate. The couple did not come to an agreement and had a quick divorce. It was rumored that the prose of life killed them. Leszek Tiliczynski only found true happiness in the early 1990s, and is still in a happy relationship with Jolanta, who became his second wife.|1

Climate change making B.C. In B.C., the influence of climate change has been especially visible in recent years.|Local residents of the Sumas Prairie region of Abbotsford, B.C. operate a rescue boat during the November 2021 floods. The event led to billions of dollars in damage to communities and highway infrastructure across the province. Stefan LabbGlacier Media The B.C. government is calling on the public to weigh in on how it should provide financial assistance in a disaster. The process, which is open to individuals, communities and small businesses, will inform a new postemergency financialassistance regulation and follows the Oct. 3, 2023, introduction of the Emergency and Disaster Management Act. The modernized act, which will be phased in starting late this year and will be reviewed every five years, requires infrastructure risk assessments and include the impact of climate change. The legislation is also guided by recognition of Indigenous rights and shifts emergency management from a focus on response to one that balances mitigation, preparation, response and recovery. Bowinn Ma, Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, said her ministry knows there remain gaps in the regulation and thats why they are calling on the public to help understand how they need assistance following an emergency. Following the 2021 atmosphericriver event, we received the highest number of applications in our Disaster Financial Assistance programs history, said Ma in a statement. I urge people to share their experiences so we can provide the most timely and effective assistance possible. Anyone interested in responding to the modernized emergency management act can do so by sending a written submission to modernizeEMgov.bc.ca by Dec. 31, 2023 or attend a virtual workshop. The public is also invited to respond to a series of questionnaires tailored to tenants, homeowners, farmers, small business owners, and Indigenous Peoples living on reserve lands, among others. B.C. emergency support outdated, finds ombudsman The call for public input comes less than two weeks after the provinces ombudsman released a report that found emergency support programs for disaster evacuees in British Columbia are outdated, underresourced, inaccessible and poorly communicated. The report analyzed the governments response to wildfires and severe flooding in 2021, finding there was unclear and confusing communication, unreasonable delays and a lack of flexibility about how help was delivered. Systems and processes that deliver assistance did not take into account the distinct needs of Indigenous evacuees, elderly people or those with physical and cognitive disabilities, said Ombudsperson Jay Chalke after the reports release. A onesizefitsall approach that weve seen in the past in terms of emergency support is shortsighted and doesnt do nearly enough to meet the needs of a diverse public that it is trying to serve, Chalke said. Meanwhile, Premier David Eby has appointed a 14member task force made up of emergency and wildfire management experts to provide recommendations on how to better prepare for emergencies before the 2024 wildfire season. Climate change making B.C. forests more flammable The 2023 wildfire season was the most destructive in B.C.s recorded history, with fires burning more than 2.8 million hectares. Thats more than double B.C.s previous record set in 2018. In B.C., the influence of climate change has been especially visible in recent years. The province has seen four of its most destructive wildfire seasons since 2017. Three of those saw more than a million hectares of forest burn across the province. By comparison, between 1919 and 2016, only three wildfires seasons burned more than half a million hectares, according to a recent study, which found climate change has made B.C. forests more flammable. Thats left researchers to conclude that B.C. will join a shortlist of global hot spots for wildfire over the coming decades. British Columbia is alongside California, Australia and the Mediterranean countries in southern Europe where catastrophic fire driven by climate change superimposed on decades of landuse practices has made our ecosystems more vulnerable, said Lori Daniels, a researcher in forestry at the University of British Columbia and one of the lead authors on the September study.

Take The Globes business and investing news quiz Home sales dropped in September and prices will continue to fall in 2023, predicts real estate association The Canadian Real Estate Association reported home resales fell 1.9 per cent in September over August primarily in Vancouver and Toronto and now expects a 10 per cent drop in sales from last year, writes Rachelle Younglai. The home price index was 753,900 in September, the first decrease since March when buyers rushed to make their purchases amid a lull in interest rate hikes. The market has since slowed with Bank of Canadas summer interest rate hikes, as well as its message that rates will stay elevated until inflation slows. Regulator warns higher interest rates and weaker commercial real estate are increasing risks at banks Citing increasing issues in commercial real estate as office vacancies rise and high rates cool the construction market, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions said that the rising cost of borrowing is putting greater pressure on the ability of consumers and companies to pay down their debt, writes Stefanie Marotta. While all commercial property types are vulnerable to higher interest rates, the office, construction and development segments pose the greatest risks, the regulator said. As a result, banks have adjusted their lending practices and are increasingly using participation agreements and other colending agreements that spread the risk across multiple lenders. However, these agreements could present some additional risks to lenders.

When commercial businesses were affected, owners say dealing with insurance has been a constant struggle, writes Michael Lewis. Experts say Canadian insurers have continued to offer commercial policies in most highrisk areas even in the face of catastrophic losses linked to climate change that cost billions last year. But with insured losses for flooding surging, some providers have started to deny flood coverage to residences and businesses on recognized flood plains.

If one option is clearly ahead of the rest the recommendation to council would be just to look at that one.The culvert at the Cache Creek Motor Inn has been identified as probably the only other chokepoint on Cache Creek.|Bridge will replace culvert beside Dairy Queen that contributed to 2023 flooding Residents of Cache Creek got an upclose look at the Highway 97 Cache Creek Crossing Restoration Project at an open house on Oct. 4. The project will include the installation of a bridge to replace the culvert under Highway 97 where it crosses Cache Creek near the Dairy Queen. The Highway 97 culvert is one of three chokepoints on the creek which have been identified as as having contributed to major flooding in the community, most recently in May 2023. The fourlane bridge, which will be approximately 13 metres long and built to a 75year lifespan, will see the creek daylighted at that spot. The channel will be deepened and widened to handle peak river flows and debris, especially during the spring freshet, and will be built to ensure structural stability against erosion. John Robineau, deputy director the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructures MOTI Cariboo Road Recovery Projects, is in charge of the project, along with 10 other major projects between Williams Lake and Quesnel in response to landslides in 2020 and 2021. He says that his project team was able to take on the project to support the recovery efforts in Cache Creek, and that they are looking to see work begin as early as this winter. The entire project is expected to take one construction season usually April through October, with a plan to complete the work in 2024. Weve done advance procurement for some components of the bridge, and preconstruction activities, such as utility relocation, are done in advance of work starting, he says. While thats underway traffic management like signs and cones will be in place. The southbound lanes will be built first, then the northbound lanes, so well build two lanes and move traffic to that, then build the other two lanes. During construction all business access will remain open, and pedestrian and bike access will still be maintained, so people can get to the school. Robineau notes that the bridge design will allow the highway to remain at the current elevation, so drivers wont face a hump. The new crossing will be wider and deeper to accommodate design flows, as well as debris coming down the channel. Were also looking to accommodate for floodwater volumes. Climate resiliency is a key focus with this project. He notes that there are several benefits to the ministry and the village working together on the Cache Creek corridor, and says that the Highway 97 crossing the most downstream of the three chokepoints on the creek is a good place to start work from a hydraulic perspective. If you start at the top Quartz Road you get a perfect new channel, but water hits the next chokepoint with more volume. Working up to the headwater establishes a new standard for all of them. Robineau adds that the project will also improve the environmental habitat within the creeks channel, and that the ministry and Bonaparte First Nation have worked together to prevent spawning in the channel for this season, to facilitate the new habitat being built. It goes a long way to start rebuilding Cache Creek as a fish habitat thats a safe place to be. He acknowledges that there is certainly more work to be done, however, a sentiment with which Cache Creek CAO Damian Couture agrees. Were starting a public consultation process, says Couture. We want to be thorough, but we know we have to be fast. Weve been working heavily with MOTI, and have been focused on assisting with their project, but now that theyre ready for tender we can shift focus back to the other two chokepoints. One of the two is at Quartz Road, where the creek has now been daylighted past the fire hall. Before this years flooding there were three lanes at Quartz Road and Highway 1 two vehicle lanes exiting onto the highway and one vehicle lane entering from it, with no dedicated pedestrian space. The road has been gone since May, and Couture says the village has been hearing a lot from the public about what needs to happen there. Its not a quick process, but were trying to get through it as quickly as we can. What people want there can be very different from person to person. We do hear We want a bridge, but there can be a lot of different bridges to span that space. The village has recently put out a survey available on their Facebook page and website residents can also contact the village office by phone, email, or inperson outlining the four options they are considering for Quartz Road 1 Put in a bigger culvert that is rated to handle the water flow, but keep the same lane configuration as in the past. This would probably be the least costly option for the village, as restoring the site to more or less its preevent condition would mean that 90 to 95 per cent of the project cost would be covered by Disaster Financial Assistance. 2 Create a bridge with three vehicle lanes two exiting Quartz Road and one entering it and pedestrian space. This would probably be the most costly option. 3 Create a bridge with only two lanes, one of which would be wide enough for vehicles but would be used for pedestrians except in case of emergency. We understand that theres a decent amount of contention about the amount of traffic at the fourway stop adjacent to the community hall, says Couture, so maybe it makes sense that Quartz Road leaving the residential area is out only to Highway. One of the two lanes could be pedestrian walking space, but could be used for traffic. 4 Leave the area more or less as it is now, with no road access to Highway 1 and a pedestrian bridge across Cache Creek at Quartz Road. Maybe we dont put anything back, get rid of the road, prettyup the space, and have a pedestrian bridge, says Couture. Three of the four proposed plans would have major traffic implications for the area, and Couture says that council has already directed staff to begin conversations with MOTI about changing the traffic light signalization at Highway 97 and Stage Road, regardless of what goes in at Quartz. I wish we had some mockup designs, but waiting for them would slow down the process, Couture adds. Thats why its so important to get input. We want to see what people want, get first and second choices, then do mockups or theoretical drawings of the top two, or maybe even just one if its a resounding winner. If one option is clearly ahead of the rest the recommendation to council would be just to look at that one. The culvert at the Cache Creek Motor Inn has been identified as probably the only other chokepoint on Cache Creek. There used to be multiple culverts throughout the community, but theyve slowly been removed, notes Couture. After weve spanned the other two it might be the only culvert left in the whole waterway within municipal limits. There has been some significant discussion going on about how to solve that issue. With all that water going through the space, can it handle that much volume, or will it be damaged asks Couture. Weve been talking with adjacent property owners and many ministries to sort out that issue, and the conversations with all the parties have been great so far. Everyone has a common goal that this is an issue that needs to be resolved. Couture adds that the village already has an eye on the 2024 freshet season. Were already having conversations with the Ministry of Emergency Management about what if we have the same issue next year with the same volumes and what do we need to do to mitigate something like this years event. That conversation is ongoing. Well see some substantial change, but its very challenging figuring out how to do so much before the next freshet. We have some strong allies and advocates who are working with us, and I think well see some positive things. Im hoping for the best.|1

Jeff McIntoshThe Canadian Press Load Image United Conservative Party members have proposed a resolution requiring parental notification whenever a student under 16 wants to change their name or pronouns at school. The resolution, which echoes legislation just introduced in the Saskatchewan legislature, is one of 30 policies up for discussion at the governing partys annual general meeting next month. The policy is proposed by the UCP constituency in EdmontonWest Henday. As was noted by Saskatchewan Education Minister Dustin Duncan, schools require a signed permission slip to take children on a field trip so its unclear why schools should not require parental consent for identification changes, the rationale for the resolution states. Schools should not be in the business of going behind parents backs. Kristopher Wells, an associate professor and the Canada Research Chair for the Public Understanding of Sexual and Gender Minority Youth at MacEwan University in Edmonton, said he is disappointed but not surprised the pronouns resolution is in the policy package. Wells said these kinds of measures are meanspirited, discriminatory and hurtful to vulnerable students who would benefit from having support at school. The research tells us quite clearly that gender affirmation reduces suicide ideation, Wells said in an interview with CBC News. These kinds of policies, when theyre enacted, cause very significant harm and realworld damage to young people. Premier Danielle Smith won the UCP leadership in 2022 with the backing of Take Back Alberta, an antivaccine, antilockdown activist group, whose leadership is opposed to transgender rights and believes parents need to fight back against a socalled woke ideology in the school system. On Friday, Smith suggested her government would have to talk to more than just UCP members before deciding to go ahead with a parental rights law. We also confer with stakeholders and we also talk to Albertans, Smith said at an unrelated news conference Friday. I want to see how the debate goes and then well make some decisions once we see whether or not it passes. Take Back Alberta At last years annual general meeting, a flood of TBA supporters helped get directors tied to the group elected to the partys provincial board. The group swept all nine seats, to control half the UCP board. This years annual general meeting set for Nov. 3 and 4 in Calgary was moved to a larger venue due to a surge of registrations. Other policies up for debate include proposals to end affirmative action for postsecondary admissions, close all Diversity, Inclusion and Equity offices at postsecondary institutions and prohibit the implementation of 15minute cities, a planning concept that encourages locating services within walking distance of peoples homes. Other resolutions reflect grievances from the COVID19 pandemic For example, two proposals aim to shield physicians from censure or job loss if they speak out against the use of COVID19 vaccines, or prescribe medications like Ivermectin to treat COVID19, even though it is not approved for that use in Canada. Melanee Thomas, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, said some of proposals are influenced by conspiracies about the COVID19 pandemic as well as the Republican politics in the United States. Thomas said data from 2018 showed there was a contingent of Alberta voters who were very socially conservative, pessimistic about the future and not politically active. Danielle Smith politically activated them, and their influence is now seen throughout the 2023 proposals, Thomas said. It looks like Take Back Alberta is very organized, she said. But Im not sure there are other elements within the party that might want to push back against some of these things that are as organized as Take Back Alberta is.|1

The latest incident yesterday was the worst in the 30 years that many of the more than 200 vendors who operate from the facility have experienced. This is their third major fire, coupled with a devastating flood that wreaked havoc in 2017 and breakins, which occur constantly. This is a pretty major blow to the smallbusiness community in Montego Bay, and this has happened just before Christmas, Deputy Prime Minister Dr Horace Chang told The Gleaner on Sunday, hours after visiting the vendors who have lost millions, of dollars in goods. According to Chang, the shortterm plan is to look at some businesscontinuity solution, and in the medium term, solutions aimed at fixing the facility, which is mainly board and zinc, through rehabilitation. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. As a result of the type of material in the market, the fire department warns that usually when there is a fire on the property, it spreads quickly, and on arrival there about 215 a.m., free burning was taking place. At least 60 per cent of the property was on fire. We used three pumpers until Trelawny arrived to assist us ... firefighting activities continued for about an hour before the fire was brought under control, Fire Superintendent Roland Walters said. Four hours later, the fire team was still spraying down the property with water. The fire load in this area is very heavy. Our initial investigation is showing that there are approximately 100 shops. All the shops are board, and the material is highly flammable, hence the extent of the damage, he noted. Rubbished accusations The fire department is currently investigating the cause of the fire. Walters rubbished accusations by the vendors that there was no water in the trucks that arrived from the Montego Bay Fire Station next door to the market. Three different groups, plus family, worked on containing the fire, said Walters. He admitted that water pressure is low in the area but indicated that that did not affect their efforts because they received assistance from the St James Municipal Corporation SJMC. The lands on which the market is located, between Creek Street and South Street, downtown Montego Bay, are owned by the SJMC. Deputy Mayor of Montego Bay Richard Vernon, who visited the facility Sunday morning, said he was awaiting the investigation of the fire department, however, he urged the people affected to go ahead and submit their reports to the team. As soon as the investigations are completed, the St James Municipal Corporation will meet with all the people who have been affected by the fire. So that we can devise the most appropriate approach to addressing the situation, he stated. In the meantime, 64yearold Imogene Salmon, who is fighting her third fire in the 30 years she has been operating in the market, is devastated. So is 65yearold Monica Bennett, who lost all her goods in 2015 when her shop was burnt to the ground and again returned to ashes on Sunday morning. My second fire and my store has been robbed three times. I am in court right now with one of the robbers who was held, and now fire tek mi, she lamented, hardly able to stand. It was a man who held me up when I got into the market. Right now mi weak. When I saw my shop, I felt like I want to go to the bathroom. Everything that me have burn up. All my investment, including bandana that I bought hoping to sell for Heroes Day, she told The Gleaner. Bennett said she left her shop at midnight Saturday, reached home by 1230 a.m., and by 130 a.m., she received a call that the market was on fire. Salmon said the last time she was flooded out in 2017, no one came to help them. Everything happen over yah, nobody nuh help we. Nutten. I dont save a pin, she cried. Last Wednesday, she purchased 40,000 worth of goods in the Falmouth Market, she said, because she wanted to catch the holiday. The only thing she sold out of that fresh batch was one blouse. Revealing that things had not been going so well in the market, she said she bought a deep freeze three months ago and started selling drinks. The deep freeze and several cases of drinks burnt beyond recognition. Many more shops would have been affected had it not been for a container that literally slowed the fire. A man who goes by the name Scott said this was his second fire, and he was at a loss for words. Overcome by the destruction, he said there was a great deal of uncertainty regarding his future. My shop has been broken into three times, and I saw ashes when I reached the market this morning. Right now mi nuh know wah me a go do. Christmas deh right round the corner. Bills have to pay, children to send to school. It is estimated that some 40 shops went up in flames. janet.silveragleanerjm.com|1

The homes are located in the Chilliwack River Valley Electoral Area E. The area the homes sit on has been assessed numerous times by engineers, with the conclusion that the six properties are not safe to occupy. Story continues below advertisement One of the engineering reports states, A large landslide in the Chilliwack River Valley is certain, and such a landslide would damage or destroy any structures and kill anyone inside. MacAhonic said she has been working closely with the residents affected, who have expressed that they have suffered immense trauma. The constant delays and lack of information, as well as long gaps in any communication from the province, has exacerbated this trauma and some are experiencing health and mental health concerns due to the further stress of this uncertainty, she said. The B.C. Ministry of Emergency and Climate Readiness said the residents were not eligible for disaster financial assistance since the risk of future landslides are not covered under the current policy. In early 2023, the Ministry of Emergency and Climate Readiness sent its engineering consultant to conduct further assessments of the six properties and make recommendations on whether mitigation works are possible. In May 2023, residents were informed of the results of these assessments that mitigation works are not feasible, MacAhonic said. The affected homeowners have been waiting since May for a provincial resolution, with some choosing to live in the unsafe properties as they have no other options. The assessed value of the six properties in 2021 was less than 5 million in total. The homeowners want fair market value for their homes. Story continues below advertisement One of those residents is Richard Holmes, who had been living at his home for more than 40 years. Prior to the event, it was a home that was valued at a million dollars. Now, my official B.C. assessment for my house and property is 2, he told Global News. We were fully insured but land movement disqualified an insurance claimThe landslide was caused by crown land above us, coming down and compressing our property and moving crown land beneath us. Our whole acre was destroyed and this is government property. This seems like a hit and run by the government. Another resident, Hans Baer, who has lived in his home for around 18 years, said the entire timeline of events has flipped his life upside down. I paid my taxes and I was a good citizen, he told Global News on Sunday. On November 15, everything has changed. My house is worth zero now. It was estimated to be worth 2.5 million. I put a tremendous amount of sweat into this house. I think this is when the government should come in and help people. My complete retirement is in question I have no place to go. MacAhonic spoke with Global News on Sunday These people are the salt of the earth they are hardworking taxpaying citizens with families, and this has been absolutely traumatic, she said. David Eby said there has been a precedent before where we have had other situations where people have been paid out the assessed values of their homes. Story continues below advertisement The Ministry of Emergency and Climate Readiness provided a statement through email. We recognize that this has been an extremely challenging situation for the impacted residents, a spokesperson said. The province is continuing to work with the Fraser Valley Regional District to explore all possibilities for the best ways to support residents. Through our partnership with the Canadian Red Cross, financial assistance is available to help residents with temporary accommodations, emotional and wellbeing supports, moving expenses, and storage expenses.|1

They will act as Guinness World Record witnesses and ensure Rouble is safe throughout his journey.|It floats Aiming to break a Guinness World Record today, avid gardener Brent Rouble is attempting to paddle at least 63 kilometres along the St. Marys River and towards Hilton Beach in his giant pumpkin If youre not a fan of James and the Giant Peach, then perhaps youll appreciate Brent and the Giant Pumpkin. Local geologist Brent Rouble said a million things would have to go right to break an unusual but challenging Guinness World Record paddling in a giant pumpkin for more than 62 kilometres. Having grown regularsized pumpkins for the past three years in his Boundary Road backyard, the passionate gardener decided to take it up a notch heading into last spring. I really wanted to grow a giant pumpkin, he told SooToday. I researched it like crazy. After I planted it, Id work on it pretty much every night from 710 between May and October. Rouble managed to grow a pumpkin just shy of 900 pounds smashing his previous record of 88 pounds. His accomplishment was recognized at the Algoma Farmers Markets annual Giant Pumpkin Weigh Off last month as he secured first place. Despite winning the competition, Rouble had bigger goals in mind. I saw this article that someone broke the world record for the furthest journey in a giant pumpkin boat, he explains. If could grow a pumpkin big enough that I could fit in and paddle, then I wanted to attempt that record. The shape looks like a boat kind of, and the top of it actually looks like a hull, he adds. Its really flat and wide at the bottom. After carving out the pumpkins insides and cutting a hole through the top, Rouble was joined by family, friends, and several dozen Saultites at the Bellevue Marina on Sunday morning all of whom anxiously awaited to see if the giant plant would in fact float. As members with Thrive Tours assisted Rouble and his orange craft into the water, cheers began to erupt around the marina when the pumpkin bobbled and then stabilized. It floats Rouble exclaimed. Crossing his fingers tightly for favourable current and wind conditions, Rouble will attempt to paddle to Hilton Beach a 65kilometre feat that would guarantee the world record for longest distance travelled in a pumpkin boat. But it wont be easy. Ill be kneeling for up to 16 hours in the pumpkin, with my upper body sticking out, while paddling the whole time, Rouble explains. Its going to be tough, but Im ready. The adventurous gardener is joined by Thrive Tours founders Brad Robinson and Amanda Cora, as well as Kyle Scali who is leading a team on his 30foot boat. They will act as Guinness World Record witnesses and ensure Rouble is safe throughout his journey. Theres so much crazy stuff going on in the world, Rouble says. I feel like we just need more pumpkins in the news. Im hoping this can just be an inspiration for kids, he adds. If you learn enough, research enough, and if youre crazy enough you can do anything. Even if you dont know if youll succeed or not, just try it. Readers can track Roubles progress today by clicking here.|1

Simcoe County has a wealth of significant wetlands. This is what the residents of Simcoe County have stated in past polls. With an even more hollowedout local media, it puts more responsibility on groups like the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition and its members to stay vigilant and uphold the values to which citizens so clearly adhere. Margaret Prophet is the executive director of the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition.|The environmental and housing policies of this government put much at risk, including places that clean our water, filter our air and prevent flooding, says advocate This is the second in a threepart series of guest columns from the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition leading up to An Evening with Margaret Atwood, a soldout fundraising event slated for Oct. 28. In my last column, I spoke about how our area, its economy, people and communities are deeply connected to the Greenbelt. I also outlined how this connection has translated into political pressure, with our region seeing some of the most active voices and outpouring of support in response to the corrupted Greenbelt land takeouts. The breadth and depth of this public support stands in stark contrast to the local MPPs who were among those voting to take land out of the Greenbelt. Recent polling confirms the deep connection our region has to the environment. In 2016, Environics found 94 per cent of us in Simcoe County wanted farmland and natural areas protected, and 82 per cent wanted urban development in places where infrastructure already existed in other words, within existing settlement areas and not as sprawl. This polling found the strength of support here was even stronger than that found in other areas, including York Region, Peel, Waterloo, Toronto and Durham. People also understand projects like the Bradford Bypass dont align with responsible development. Another poll, this time by Oracle, found a measly 29 per cent supported the project. This has since dropped to 20 per cent three years later. A large majority of us, 61 per cent, opposes the project. I outline all of this information because policy changes under this government, with the support of local MPPs, run counter to these values and the clear priorities residents have for development that is responsible, that doesnt end up costing us more in taxes, more in underfunded health care and education, more in lost farmland, air and water quality. Citizens and local organizations are instrumental in understanding these policies and their effects on their communities and local environment, and they are ringing the alarms on the impacts these changes will have. Case in point provincially significant wetlands. Simcoe County has a wealth of significant wetlands. Many overlap or are on the fringes of groundwater resources we depend on, like the Oro Moraine. Bill 23 which is now law reduces protection for these areas. By narrowing the definition of what is considered a provincially significant wetland, many of them may lose their status, and thus no longer receive the same protection. These changes also allow developers an outsized role in this process, giving them the power to reclassify wetlands to a downgraded status. Master naturalist Bob Bowles, who evaluated most of those significant wetlands, says it will leave them extremely vulnerable to exploitation and degradation. But it isnt just wetlands, groundwater and wildlife we should be concerned with here. In addition to the habitat and other ecosystem services wetlands provide, they offer some of the best protection against flooding. A recent report from this government outlines just how hard hit Ontario is likely to be by climate change. Flooding, it notes, increases conditions in which waterborne disease can develop, including by providing conditions for the proliferation of flies, ticks and mosquitoes that carry Lyme disease and West Nile virus. The report continues, outlining how irresponsible development in floodplains and wetlands leads to an increased risk of flooding in the future. Yet we continue to see policies that run counter to this science and put these floodplains and wetlands in more danger of being razed and paved. Other changes under Bill 23 severely curtail the ability of municipalities to generate revenue from development. This is revenue municipalities use to deliver necessary infrastructure and services to those same developments, and was part of a longstanding understanding roughly captured by the phrase, development pays for development. The County of Simcoe calculates these changes mean a loss of almost 200 million, with citizens now on the hook for a potential four to five per cent tax hike down the road. Note how the costs for development have been shifted from developers to the public. Municipal leaders face difficult choices as a result, either to hike tax rates, reduce services, or some combination thereof. Regardless of their choice, the public loses. Writ large, the environmental and housing policies of this government put much at risk, including places that clean our water, filter our air and prevent flooding. We want more development to happen in places where it makes the most sense. These are places where infrastructure currently exists and where it can be improved and expanded upon. This is what the residents of Simcoe County have stated in past polls. People here know that we can build vibrant communities, that we can have thriving and sustainable economies, and that all of this is built on the foundation of a healthy environment. If it werent for the leadership of local community groups and Indigenous communities, there would be little scrutiny of these policy changes. With an even more hollowedout local media, it puts more responsibility on groups like the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition and its members to stay vigilant and uphold the values to which citizens so clearly adhere. Margaret Atwood, acknowledging the leadership displayed by Indigenous communities and local groups in the Greenbelt takeout reversal, wants to ensure these local voices can remain strong into the future and is hosting a fundraiser at the end of October. She will be doubling the impact of public charitable donations made here, matching up to 10,000 in total. Together, we can protect what matters and have communities that reflect our values. Margaret Prophet is the executive director of the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition.|1

Try refreshing your browser, or Play Video A significant contributor to flood cars are natural, such as hurricanes or heavy rainfalls that cause rivers and lakes to overflow. When this happens, cars are often left sitting in high water for days, which could result in serious damage to the vehicle and its internal components, especially if they havent been properly replaced or repaired. Recommended from Editorial Is water damage covered by auto insurance Your Corner Wrench What to do when water gets into your cars lights The good news is that there are several things you can do to make sure you arent buying a flooddamaged used car. Here are some tips to keep in mind Smell for odours Its hard to get the smell of musty carpets and waterlogged seat padding out of a car. If you detect an odour, this could be a good indication that stagnant water has sat in the car for a considerable amount of time. On the other hand, if the car is heavily scented with a strong air freshener or cleaner, then you should always be cautious as this could be masking something.

Article content Investigate the interior Pull back the carpets to look for lingering mud, dirt and water stains. You should also check the trunk for water lines, leftover silt or rust. If the carpets and upholstery appear as though theyve been replaced recently or look too new for an older car model, this could be another red flag. Look for condensation Check the dashboard for condensation as there could be moisture lingering in the instrument panels. Water can fry your vehicles accessories so youll also want to test all of these dashboard lights, wipers, signal lights, radio, heater, air conditioner, and any other switches or options to make sure they are all in working order. Take a closer look at the little details Have a look around the car and scrutinize the hardtoreach areas and nooks and crannies. Keep an eye out for dried mud, salt stains, rusted bolts, brittle wiring, or even mould in areas that never completely dried out.

Get a prepurchase inspection Take your vehicle to a licensed mechanic for a thorough prepurchase inspection. This inspection will determine the cosmetic, mechanical and safety condition of the car and can let you know if there is any water damage internally. This is important because while the car may seem perfect on the outside, saltwater or water damage can have lingering effects on the cars braking, steering and electrical systems. It can take months for this corrosive damage to occur so while the car may be functioning just fine during your test drive, down the road, you could run into serious problems.

Markets have reacted since Hamass attack on Israel last weekend, but the full extent of economic impact is not yet clear. Mohammed SalemReuters The war between Israel and Hamas poses a whole new series of risks to an already fragile global economy, and economists are warning it could take some time for the fallout to be clear. The global economy is limping along, not sprinting, said International Monetary Fund chief economist PierreOlivier Gourinchas at a joint meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Morocco this week. The annual meeting and its forecasts were all overshadowed by the crisis unfolding in southern Israel and Gaza. Its a humanitarian tragedy and its an economic shock we dont need, World Bank President Ajay Banga told Reuters. As the world watched those events in horror, the price of oil jumped by as much as five dollars per barrel, futures markets fell and the Israeli currency, the shekel, sank to a sevenyear low. Since then, market reaction has been relatively subdued. But most experts believe thats because no one really knows what will happen in the days ahead.

REUTERS The CIA issued two reports warning the Biden administration of increased Hamas threats days before attacks. Neither Joe Biden nor other senior White House officials were briefed on the reports. Egypt and Israel also had intelligence suggesting an upcoming terrorist onslaught. The CIA issued warnings about a potential escalation of Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel days ahead of Operation AlAqsa Flood, say reports. Two reports warned of the looming coordinated attacks, said The New York Times. The first, dated September 28, indicated a heightened risk of violence and the possibility of rocket strikes by Hamas into Israel spanning multiple days. The second report, dated October 5, issued two days before Hamas carried out its attack, warned of an increased probability of violence from the militant group. The warnings did not reach the desk of President Joe Biden or senior White House officials, according to CNN. The CIA did not consider the reports to have particular significance to policymakers. It has raised concerns about the communication process within the US intelligence community and its prioritization of threats. Some sources suggest that the military friction between Israel and Hamas was not unusual, describing the reports as routine. The conflict has been characterized by a history of onandoff violence, with occasional ceasefires. However, any escalation in the IsraelGaza region carries significant implications. The New York Times reported that several US officials, who spoke anonymously, described the reports as similar to other intelligence reports about the possibility of Palestinian violence that were written throughout the year. US intelligence agencies have been focused on other international threats, primarily from China, Russia, and Iran, The New York Times reports. This strategic shift in priorities may have contributed to the lack of attention given to the intelligence on Hamas. Israeli officials also had intel on increased Hamas activity but failed to put the border on high alert, per Axios. Story continues Egypt also warned Israel of a possible Hamas attack approximately three days before it occurred, per Forbes.

According to BC River Forecast Centre Hydrologist Jonathan Boyd, the Prince George area received approximately 350 millimetres of rain instead of the typical amount of 580. The rainfall just hasnt been what we would normally expect, and that has led to a situation now where flows are very, very low, Boyd said. Its a little bit tricky because we typically dont keep track of the drought over the winter, but at least heading into the winter, its not looking great, because this time of year, its not quite as wet as the coast, where we get fall storms that can replenish the water supply. Advertisement Boyd said the unusual part of this year was how quickly the drought kicked in. Partly it was related to the lingering drought that occurred last year. The snowpack, I would call it around normal to maybe slightly below normal, it certainly wasnt a dramatically low snowpack, Boyd said. April actually was a little bit of a cool month so there was a delay in the melt of snow, but May kicked in, and just how hot and dry May was led to the quickest melt weve recorded at our automated snow weather stations over maybe the past 50 years or so. He said flows were very high in May and June, but plummeted quickly after. By far this was the most drastic provincewide drought situation, and really was reflected with the unfortunate wildfire season as well. Boyd added during the winter, the demand for water is less, but theres still risks. There could be potential risk for freezing of rivers completely, just the potential for ice jam flooding, which are really specific challenges with maybe the lower ground water levels, he explained. Boyd said BC is moving into an El Nino season, which typically leads to warmer winters for the province. Advertisement It can vary, sometimes we do have the driest and lowest snowpacks in El Nino, sometimes we actually have very high snowpacks, he said. Itll be the low and midelevations where the expectation is therell be a little less snow accumulating because it might fall more as precipitation. He added it would take massive rainstorms from the coast spilling over into the interior to alleviate the drought conditions before winter starts. The likelihood is that the drought conditions will continue through the winter, and revolves around how much snow will fall in the winter season, combined with the potential and hope that more seasonal precipitation will occur in the March to June period. Boyd said it would take a normal to slightly above normal snowpack to help alleviate conditions throughout the winter. Its all just variable on the exact location everywhere, but I think of last year, when the snowpack was maybe normal around April 1st, but we had a really cold, wet spring, With that the snowmelt got delayed and by the time we got into the later season, relatively speaking, it was very high above normal. Boyd added the BC River Forecast Centre, will continue to monitor drought conditions over the next few weeks, and a decision will be made on if they will continue to monitor it through the winter.|1

Madonna is reportedly facing a 300,000 fine after she breached an ultrastrict show curfew on the second night of her world tour. The Queen of Pop, 65, was forced to cut her set short on Sunday night after technical issues hit her concert at Londons O2 Arena. But The Sun has reported she still overran the 1030 p.m. curfew by 30 minutes, which could land her with a 300,000 penalty. It said she didnt make it on stage until 9 p.m. on Sunday after she performed a 140minute set on Saturday night as she launched her muchanticipated Celebration world tour, which was delayed after the singer was hit by a serious bacterial infection in the summer. But on Sunday she didnt make it on stage until 9 p.m., with the concert ending at 11 p.m. amid warnings fans may miss the last Tube trains home. Hits including Like a Virgin and Celebration were axed as a result, leaving concertgoers livid. One of a flood of enraged ticket holders raged on social media How dare the bs at the O2 cut Madonna short. Curfew rules from the O2s operators AEG and Transport for London include fines of 10,000 a minute for shows that overrun. The Sun reported Greenwich Council said its midnight curfew was not broken, with a spokesman telling the newspaper We do not intend to investigate. Madonna told fans on the first night of her tour she feared she wouldnt make it after the hospitalisation that sparked the shows being postponed. The mumofsix said at the soldout concert while holding her guitar I didnt think I would make it, and neither did my doctors. Thats why I woke up with all of my children sitting around me. Rubbing her head as she recalled her health scare, she added I forgot five days of my life, or my death, I dont really know where I was. But the angels were protecting me. And my children were there. And my children always save me, every time. If you want to know how I pulled through and how I survived, I thought, I have got to be there for my children. I have to survive for them. Madonna then played an acoustic version of the Gloria Gaynor track I Will Survive. After recovering from her illness at home in New York, Madonna told fans she was rescheduling her world tour in October. There had been reports the singer had been exhausting herself in rehearsals for the shows, but before they were relaunched it was reported she was in top health.|1

A new channel has now been dug that allows river water to flow directly to the lagoon. Looking through a bird blind on a new bridge, one can see the channel connecting the Bow River and the Inglewood Bird Sanctuarys lagoon. Visitors to the bird sanctuary can get a closeup look at the improvements. The bird sanctuary was established in 1929.|A new channel carrying river water to the lagoon in the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary is expected to revitalize a key wildlife habitat. The southeast park was heavily damaged by the 2013 flood on the Bow River. Since then, there have been cleanups and a rebuilding of the park infrastructure. A study was done to come up with ways to revitalize the area and enhance things like flood and erosion control. The plan included constructing a new channel that carries water from the Bow to the sanctuarys lagoon. Anne Cataford, the citys manager of linear infrastructure delivery, said some of the lagoons infrastructure was up to 100 years old. As a result, the lagoon was diminishing in quality as a habitat for fish, birds and other creatures. A new channel has now been dug that allows river water to flow directly to the lagoon. The channel along with riverbank improvements have also improved flood protection for the sanctuary. The lagoon has been reconnected to the Bow River, providing a clear passage for fish, improving the health of the water and wildlife and reducing the risk of flooding in the park, said Cataford. Looking through a bird blind on a new bridge, one can see the channel connecting the Bow River and the Inglewood Bird Sanctuarys lagoon. Scott DippelCBC A senior project engineer with the city, Rene Letourneau, said the water outflows have also been improved as part of this 9.7million project. They aid with the circulation of the water and help with flood mitigation. Theres two outlets down at the south end of the sanctuary. Theres one thats flowing all the time, like 99 per cent of the time, and the second outlet is designed for those flood events, said Letourneau. Visitors to the bird sanctuary can get a closeup look at the improvements. A new pedestrian bridge has been built over the channel and it doubles as a functional public art project. Artist Tim Knowles designed the crossing, which is called Log Jam. He said the bridge acts as a flood control structure, a bird blind and public art. He incorporated into the bridge some of the trees that had to be removed for the construction of the channel. One of the things I wanted to do was to use those trees in the structure. That was the idea, was to sort of recycle the trees that had to come out and reuse them, said Knowles. New trees, plants and natural grasses have been planted at the sanctuary as part of the revitalization of the park and to replace some of the biodiversity that was damaged by the 2013 flood. Funding for the project was provided by the city as well as the provincial and federal governments. The bird sanctuary was established in 1929.|1

For too long the effects of a changing Arctic have been out of sight, out of mind, James Gray, an MP, and the Environmental Audit SubCommittee on Polar Research Chair said in comment Friday. Before melting glaciers and ice sheets contribute to widespread flooding and irreversible weather patterns in the UK, we must throw our full toolbox at understanding changes in the Arctic better. Numerous reports have established the risk of a sea level rise as Arctic ice melts. Rising sea levels pose a direct threat to the UK, with up to 1.5 million properties at an increased risk of flooding by 2080, the report said. The increase in floods here at home that will be caused by a changing Arctic will require difficult decisions by the Government. Knowledge gaps need to be urgently filled committee The report said the UK is a leader in polar research relative to its size and publishes 10 per cent of research papers on the Arctic, but that grant funding mechanisms when it comes to the North need to focus on longterm and not just shortterm projects. Among the committees recommendations are ensuring scientific monitoring research funding is available for projects that last a minimum of 10 years as well as an institute that could coordinate any Arctic research being done by universities in the UK to avoid duplicating work. At the moment, Arctic science is concentrated on its summer, with the Arctic winter which could tell us an enormous amount about the weather being under studied, Gray said. More collaboration is needed among UK universities to avoid repetition of scientific endeavours seeking out the same information, and with our international partners to learn and share resources. Alarmed by lack of ministers meetings on Arctic The committee also recommends the UK appoint a special polar envoy, saying the current distribution of Arctic responsibilities between four Ministers from different Government departments wasnt working. Whitehall has not been paying enough attention to the Arctic, Gray said. Four Ministers jotted around different departments with no oversight on Arctic policy is a missed opportunity. The fact the Ministers are yet to meet indicates a lack of enthusiasm on Arctic matters at the heart of Government they must meet quarterly given the drastic changes we are witnessing in our changing Arctic. The Government should now appoint a polar envoy. New fora needed for polar science as Arctic Council loses influence The report says Russias invasion of Ukraine and subsequent freeze on some 130 Arctic Council research projects involving Moscow has been devastating to polar science and will increasingly hamper the global response to climate change the longer it goes on. Russia has been frozen out of Western Arctic science following its invasion of Ukraine, Gray said. The Arctic Council, built with the purpose of boosting collaboration with Arctic nations, is becoming less influential and much of its important work has stalled. Our loss of access to Russian data is concerning, and 50 of the Arctic is now inaccessible to Western scientists. We must look into alternative international fora to champion and collaborate on Arctic research. The committee said Moscows increasing cooperation with China in the Arctic since the war is also pushing climate change further down the global agenda. Following Russias freezing out of Arctic Council activity, it has been working with China in the Russian Arctic on oil and gas extraction, it said. The Committee is concerned that the competition for resources and increased military presence by both Russia and NATO in the Arctic is diverting attention away from climate change in the region. The government has two months to respond to the committee report.

Laura Twidle, president and CEO of Catastrophe Indices and Quantification Inc. CatIQ, tells Canadian Underwriter insured losses are now over 3 billion for the year so far. This means were quickly catching up with 2022s 3.1 billion insured loss year, the thirdhighest total of NatCat losses in the nations history. The industry can also expect a recordsetting number of catastrophes. Canada has seen at least 23 NatCats this year, Joel Baker, president and CEO of MSA Research shared with delegates at at the National Insurance Conference Canada NICC in September. Catastrophes are any weatherdriven event that tops 30 million or more in insured losses, as defined by Cat IQ. The previous record number of Cats in one year was 15, set in 2022. As insurers tally outstanding claims from wildfires, and with another quarter left before the fiscal year closes out, the industry can expect this number to rise. Ontario summer storms Summer storms and flash floods that hit parts of Ontario caused over 340 million in insured losses, according to initial CatIQ estimates. A quarter of these insured losses 80 million went toward replacing or repairing stormdamaged vehicles. The Ottawa region was hardest hit, with intense flash flooding, torrential downpours and violent wind gusts, Amanda Dean, interim vice president, Ontario, Insurance Bureau of Canada IBC said in a release. Five Ontario storms were designated as Cats this summer. First, there was over 30 million in insured damage caused by severe storms in Southwestern Ontario on Jul. 2021. A cold front crossed southern Ontario and Quebec, and led to an outbreak of severe thunderstorms, which produced wind gusts, including two confirmed tornadoes near South Buxton and Petrolia. Hail and downpours caused flooding for homes and businesses, and a microburst in Sarnia caused significant damage, including downed trees, power lines, damaged outdoor furniture and fences. Next, a period of hot, humid weather caused severe thunderstorms to cross southern Ontario Jul. 2829. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed and hit the Ottawa region, which was also afflicted by hail. Meanwhile, strong winds downed trees in Windsor, and heavy downpours led to flash flooding across the province. Damages totalled over 30 million. On Aug. 3, a summertime thunderstorm caused over 100 million in insured damage across southern Ontario. The frontal system created violent wind gusts, torrential downpours and hail. Lindsay and Ottawa were among the most significantly impacted regions, where underconstruction homes got knocked down. Trees, power lines and vehicles were damaged, or partially submerged by flooding. Then, Ottawa was hit by a cold front on Aug. 10, which caused 70 million in insured damage. Thunderstorms and rainfall hit parts of the city, with Nepean and Carson Grove bearing the brunt. Streets flooded across the metro area, leaving vehicles submerged and businesses flooded. Lastly, Aug. 2325 saw over 110 million in damage from southwestern Ontario flooding and storms. Tornadoes, hail, rainfall and heavy storms remnants of Hurricane Hilary downed power lines and left nearly 5,000 customers without power. Feature image by iStock.comSlavic|1

Shortterm rentals versus tenanciesIn general, a booking made on a shortterm rental platform is not covered under the Residential Tenancy Act, but there are circumstances in which a tenancy may be established.|B.C.s ShortTerm Rental Accommodations Act The number of shortterm rentals which may include, for example, rentals listed on Airbnb, VRBO, Expedia and FlipKey have expanded rapidly over recent years, in B.C. and around the world. Data shows that shortterm rentals are diverting thousands of longterm rentals onto the shortterm market in B.C., taking away homes people need. Like many jurisdictions around the world, B.C. is responding to this growing challenge by taking action to regulate shortterm rentals and return homes back to the longterm rental market. In addition to the information on this page, please also see the October 16, 2023, ShortTerm Rental Accommodations Act news release, backgrounders, and technical briefing presentation. Page updated October 20, 2023 On this page ShortTerm Rental Accommodations Act B.C. is facing a housing crisis, with a shortage of all forms of attainable housing, including longterm rentals. The rise of shortterm rental of entire homes is taking away much needed homes for British Columbians. More than 16,000 entire homes are being used as shortterm rentals for the majority of the year in B.C. This is making it more challenging to find affordable longterm rentals. Many local governments have taken action to regulate shortterm rentals, but enforcement of bylaws is a challenge, and they have asked the Province for more tools and resources. The purpose of the new rules is to Give local governments stronger tools to enforce shortterm rental bylaws Return shortterm rental units to the longterm rental market Establish a new Provincial role in the regulation of shortterm rentals The new rules apply to all shortterm rentals being offered to the public including Offers hosted by a platform, where people reserve and pay for the rental service which may include for example, Airbnb, VRBO, Expedia, and FlipKey Offers on other web listing forums which may include for example, Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, and Craigslist Offers in classified ads in newspapers The new rules will not apply to Reserve lands Nisgaa Lands or the Treaty Lands of a Treaty First Nation unless the Nation chooses to opt into all or part of the legislation through a coordination agreement with the Province Hotels, motels Some of these new rules, like the ability of regional districts to issue business licenses and increase maximum penalties, will take effect immediately. Other changes, like the Provinces principal residence requirement and registration system will come later. Strengthening local government tools to enforce shortterm rental bylaws Increased fines and tickets The maximum fine that regional districts can set for prosecutions of bylaw offences under the Offence Act will increase from 2,000 to 50,000. This is consistent with the maximum fines for municipalities under the Community Charter. The Province also intends to increase the maximum municipal ticketing fine a local government may issue. These maximum fines could then be applied in Municipalities Regional districts Islands Trust New business licensing authority for regional districts Regional districts will be able to regulate and license shortterm rentals and other businesses, in similar ways to municipalities. This proposed change comes from amendments to the Local Government Act. Display of business license Some local governments require a business license for a host to operate a shortterm rental. In areas where a business license is required, shortterm rental hosts will be required to display a valid business license number on their listing. Platform accountability If a listing does not include a valid business license, where a business license is required by the local government, the shortterm rental platform must remove the listing at the request of the local government. Data sharing Local governments have been challenged with getting the data they need for bylaw enforcement. Under the new rules, shortterm rental platforms will be required to share information about shortterm listings with the Province. The Province can then share this information with local governments. The Province will keep the shortterm rental information confidential and will not disclose it to the public. Returning shortterm rental units to the longterm rental market Principal residence requirement The Province is implementing a provincial principal residence requirement which will limit shortterm rentals to The principal resident requirement will apply provincewide in municipalities with a population of 10,000 and over and adjacent communities. Future regulations are anticipated to set out areas or types of accommodation that will be exempt from the principal resident requirement including The 14 Resort Municipalities Most municipalities under 10,000 population except those adjacent to larger municipalities Regional district electoral areas Mountain Resort Areas and Designated Resort Regions Islands Trust Agritourism accommodations In exempt areas, local governments can request to opt in to the principal residence requirement. There will also be a process for communities with a higher vacancy rate to request to opt out of the principal residence requirement. The Provinces principal residence requirement would function as a floor meaning that local governments will still be able to have more restrictive bylaws depending on local needs, as many have already chosen to do. Shortterm rental hosts will continue to be required to follow local bylaws in place. List of communities where the principal residence requirement will apply Below is the list of communities where the principal residence requirement will apply the communities listed either have a population of more than 10,000 people or are adjacent to larger communities. There will be a process for the communities listed below with a higher vacancy rate to request to opt out of the principal residence requirement. Communities currently exempted from the principal residence requirement and not listed below may also be added, if a local government requests to join or opt in to the principal residence requirement.

Changes to legal nonconforming use protections Effective May 1, 2024, protections for nonconforming use of property will no longer apply to short term rentals. In some areas, these protections have historically allowed hosts to continue to use their property for shortterm rentals even when it was against the new rules set by the local government. Also effective May 1, 2024, the new provincial principal residence requirement will come into effect. This means that regardless of local zoning bylaws, the principal residence requirement will apply in designated communities listed above. Information about nonconforming use is available through local governments. Nonconforming use authorities will continue to exist for other land uses. Establishing provincial oversight of shortterm rentals Provincial registry The Province will establish a shortterm rental registry. This will help ensure that shortterm rental hosts and platforms are following the rules and provide local governments and the Province the information needed to follow up when they dont. Hosts will be required to include a provincial registration number on their listing. They will also have to include their business license number, if a business license is required by the local government. Platforms will be required to validate registration numbers on host listings against the Provinces registry data. Provincial compliance and enforcement unit In order to ensure the rules are being followed, the Province will establish a provincial compliance and enforcement unit. This unit will Track compliance Issue orders Administer penalties for violations Timeline The regulations and responsibilities under the proposed Act will come into effect at different times over the next two years through a phased approach. Immediately after Royal Assent Increased fines and tickets, business licensing authority for regional districts Increased fines and tickets, business licensing authority for regional districts May 1, 2024 Principal residence requirement including definition of exempt areas or accommodations, changes to legal nonconforming use protections Principal residence requirement including definition of exempt areas or accommodations, changes to legal nonconforming use protections Summer 2024 Data sharing Data sharing Late 2024 Provincial registry launch, requiring platforms to remove listings without valid provincial registry numbers Definitions These are some of the definitions for the ShortTerm Rental Accommodations Act. Shortterm rental Shortterm rentals are accommodations provided to members of the public in a hosts property, in exchange for money, for a period of less than 90 consecutive days. They are generally tourist accommodations that are often found in residential or resort areas. They may be advertised via online platforms such as Airbnb, VRBO, Expedia and FlipKey, but may also include shortterm rental offers on other web forums including Facebook Marketplace, or found in classified ads in newspapers. Principal residence A principal residence is the residence an individual lives in for a longer period during a calendar year than any other place. Platform service Platform services are the facilitation of promotion and transactions for reservations and payments related to shortterm rental accommodation services in British Columbia, provided by a platform. Secondary suite A secondary suite is a selfcontained living unit with its own kitchen, sleeping area, and washroom facilities, and which is contained within a dwelling unit. Accessory dwelling unit An accessory dwelling unit often referred to as an ADU is a selfcontained living unit with its own kitchen, sleeping area, and washroom facilities, and which is located on the same property as a dwelling unit. An accessory dwelling unit is sometimes referred to as a garden suite, laneway home, carriage house or garage suite. Shortterm rentals versus tenancies In general, a booking made on a shortterm rental platform is not covered under the Residential Tenancy Act, but there are circumstances in which a tenancy may be established. If there is uncertainty about the legal requirements related to a specific accommodation arrangement, it is best to speak with a lawyer.

The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary showcases so many of the varied amenities that Calgary has to offer. The Log Jam celebrates the history of the site as a former sawmill, while also complementing the natural environment surrounding it, says artist Tim Knowles. This investment will ensure the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary remains a treasured place for generations to come. Mayor Jyoti GondekThe Inglewood Bird Sanctuary has been an important part of the local community for over 80 years and is beloved by Calgarians and visitors alike.|A beloved wildlife sanctuary in Calgary has received muchneeded upgrades to repair flood damage and erosion, improve water quality and restore habitats for the birds, fish and other animals that call the park home. Established in 1929 as one of the first migratory bird sanctuaries in the country, the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary is the only federallyrecognized urban facility of its kind in Canada. Over time, human use, natural processes and largescale events such as the 2013 flood have impacted the parks features, including the 100year old lagoon, outlets and channels. The outfall structures, which regulate water levels, reached the end of their lifecycle and the inlet to the lagoon was filled with sediment, disconnecting the lagoon from the river and impacting water and wildlife health as well as fish passage through the area. A study was conducted to identify opportunities to improve the area, repair damage and enhance flood and erosion control. An initial restoration plan was shared with Calgarians in 2018 and construction began in spring 2022 as a collaborative effort between Infrastructure Services, Operational Services and Public Art. This is a unique project that provides the opportunity to enhance the natural environment while building on Calgarys pedestrian infrastructure and providing functional art for community members to enjoy, says the General Manager of Infrastructure Services Michael Thompson. The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary showcases so many of the varied amenities that Calgary has to offer. The improvements made through the Reconnection project are a reflection of the collaborative efforts of many City teams to provide the best outcome for Calgarians. Over a period of three years, artist Tim Knowles worked closely with the project team of engineers, hydrologists and naturalists to help design the path of a new channel to reconnect the Bow River into the lagoon and out through a water meadow. In addition to landscaping and habitat creation, the design also includes a new functional art pedestrian crossing, giving visitors a new way to access and enjoy the park. The Log Jam celebrates the history of the site as a former sawmill, while also complementing the natural environment surrounding it, says artist Tim Knowles. The crossing is a hybrid structure part bridge, part flood control mechanism, bird blind and log jam. The design incorporates native lumber sourced from the site where possible and includes a cantilever timber deck with benches and screened viewing areas for bird watching. As part of the Fish Habitat Compensation program, new pools and shallow riffles were added to restore fish habitat, provide protection and oxygenate the water. More than 90 new trees will help improve the health of the riparian forest and replenish the much older tree canopy. Closer to the ground, new plants, shrubs and grass will increase biodiversity. As the site is a federal bird sanctuary, the primary goal of the project was to restore and support the natural environment, while also providing features to enhance the experience for park users, says Project Manager Ren Letourneau. Great care was taken during project design to maximize habitat benefits and to minimize impacts to birds and other wildlife during construction. Funding for this 9.7 million project was provided by The City of Calgary, the Government of Albertas Watershed Resiliency and Restoration Program and Environment Climate Change Canadas Environmental Damages fund.

Quotes The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary Reconnection project is a shining example of how, by working collaboratively, we can restore the natural environment, protect wildlife habitat and create green spaces where visitors can enjoy and learn about the environment for years to come. The Government of Canada is proud to support projects like this across the country through the Environmental Damages Fund which turns penalties for environmental infractions into projects which improve the natural environment. Minister Steven Guilbeault, Environment and Climate Change The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary Reconnection project is an excellent example of nature being maintained in an urban area. The thoughtful planning that went into this project will have a positive impact for years to come through more vibrant and sustainable wildlife habitat, more effective flood resiliency and water quality, and a better experience for park users. Minister Rebecca Schulz, Environment and Protected Areas Part of what makes Calgary one of the most livable cities in the world is our vast outdoor recreational opportunities. Our parks are critical infrastructure that must be well maintained to protect biodiversity and Calgarians wellbeing. This investment will ensure the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary remains a treasured place for generations to come. Mayor Jyoti Gondek The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary has been an important part of the local community for over 80 years and is beloved by Calgarians and visitors alike. The improvements made through this reconnection project will help to ensure the continued vibrancy of the park into the next 80 years and beyond. Ward 9 Councillor, Gian Carlo Carra|1

While it will be rewarding to bring the grapes in, the numbers will be historically low thanks to the unprecedented vine damage that occurred last winter. Wine lovers are quick to feel empathy when they hear about their fave producers getting hit by fires or flood, but the freeze that happened last December was a catastrophe on a far higher level. Heres the bottom line the harvest is forecast to be 54 percent less than normal, with 45 percent of the vines suffering longterm damage and 29 percent requiring complete replanting. Which all offers a perfect chance for us to rally around these wineries and snap up the bottles they are releasing. And while we think of harvest as a generic term, the reality is that in a highly variable climatic zone like the Okanagan, where we grow such a vast array of grape varietals, there will be some producers who pick grapes as early as midAugust and others who might start as late as Octoberand thats not even considering the hardy souls who brave the freezing temperatures to make ice wine. But even with those broad guidelines, there is much variation within each window of picking time. Do you want your chardonnay to be light and crisp or round and warm Will your cabernet franc be juicy or powerful Here are three options that celebrate three distinctive stages of harvest. Tantalus Blanc de Noir, 31 Its odd to think of red grapes, even the delicate pinot noir, as early ripeners, but for his sparkling wine, winemaker David Paterson wants low alcohol and elevated acidity this wine is fantastically vibrant so these grapes are often the first picked on the East Kelowna Tantalus estate. tantalus.ca Liquidity Viognier, 30 Viognier is traditionally one of the latest white grapes to be harvested, as winemakers want to exploit the signature perfumed nose and soft, rich mouthfeel, but Liquiditys Amy Paynter picks hers early to craft a viognier that has more acidity than most plus elegant, light, elevated florals. liquiditywines.com Phantom Creek Estates Cabernet Franc, 42 Cabernet franc is always near the last to be harvested picked too early, it displays green and overly herbaceous qualitiesbut leave it too long and it can become hot and flabby. Phantom Creeks Mark Beringer chooses the perfect middle ground, keeping some freshness and wild herb characteristics as a partner to the ripe dark cherry and black currant notes. phantomcreekestates.com This story was originally published in the SeptemberOctober 2023 issue of Vancouver Magazine.|1

That was seriously the best pumpkin a guy could ask for in doing something like this. There were strangers coming from Bruce Mines and Thessalon to see this crazy guy in a pumpkin, he says. Thrive Tours said that would be a good river to break the world record, he says. Waiting to hear back from Guinness for confirmation, Rouble believes he is the furthest to paddle in a pumpkin boat on the Great Lakes.|I fought for every metre Despite missing the Guinness World Record, enthusiastic gardener Brent Rouble paddled 23 km in his giant pumpkin on Sunday He may not have broken the Guinness World Record for furthest distance travelled in a pumpkin boat, but Sault resident Brent Rouble couldnt be happier for the memorable experience he had this weekend. After growing a 900pound pumpkin in his eastend backyard, the local geologist managed to paddle in the giant plant for just over 23 kilometres along St. Marys River and the open waters of Lake Huron on Sunday before some tough waves forced him to stop. His eightandahalfhour journey with virtually no breaks began in front of an excited crowd yesterday morning at the Bellevue Marina. With the support of Thrive Tours and a safety crew team led by his friend Kyle Scali, Roubles trek came to a bittersweet end near Echo Bay around 430 p.m. Although he was feeling slightly sore this morning, Rouble says the temporary pain is beyond worth it. It was such a cool adventure the sights were absolutely beautiful, he told SooToday. That was seriously the best pumpkin a guy could ask for in doing something like this. It was tough as nails, it floated perfectly, and it was stable. I didnt feel worried about tipping at all. While his unconventional water craft miraculously withstood a number of challenges over the course of that afternoon, high waves and luckless currents inevitably made the goal of breaking the 62kilometre world record an impossibility. I fought for every metre, he says. I thought the wind would help, but for half the trip, the wind was actually against me. The current didnt help either it was working against us the whole time. Some of the waves were coming into the pumpkin and getting me pretty soaked as well. But its a world record its not supposed to be easy. Rouble achieved a maximum speed of five kilometreshour, or walking speed, but there were times he was only travelling one kilometrehour or less. His average speed finished at just over two kilometreshour, which meant he would have had to paddle for more than 30 hours at that pace to claim the record. I was literally crawling to St. Joseph Island, he says. The speed just wasnt enough. The currents really were the only thing that didnt go right through all of this. I knew it wasnt going to be safe to go all through the night and into the morning. Despite some hardship along the way, the passionate gardener says he felt all the good vibes from his supporters which helped greatly. There were strangers coming from Bruce Mines and Thessalon to see this crazy guy in a pumpkin, he says. I heard people on the Canadian side yelling go Brent go sometimes, which was a huge help because it definitely got tough. American boaters were passing us, and we saw them doing double takes since they were wondering what we were doing which was pretty funny. Preparing to do it all again next year, Rouble says hes looking for a sponsor to help his team travel to the Grand River in southern Ontario as he hopes to grow an even larger pumpkin and break the distance record there. Thrive Tours said that would be a good river to break the world record, he says. You need fastmoving water, and pumpkins do not paddle well theyre too big and too round. Unless you have fast water, you wont be moving that quickly. If I can grow a pumpkin with a bit of legroom, I could go for days, he laughed. Waiting to hear back from Guinness for confirmation, Rouble believes he is the furthest to paddle in a pumpkin boat on the Great Lakes. While hes unlikely to attempt that water system again, he encourages anyone up to the challenge to give it a try. Its definitely not easy, but it is beatable, he says. If anyone wants to beat it, just grow a giant pumpkin and pick a good day for currents. Grateful for the communitys response to his bold venture, Rouble is hopeful his story will help inspire the younger generation to always think big. I heard stories about kids getting pumped up about this, he says. Some of them were curious about world records and even about gardening. Im hoping we inspired some kids to do some good in the community.|1

Chinese EV makers are drawn to Europe because auto import tariffs are just 10 versus 27.5 in the U.S., independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt said. MG owned by SAIC Motor, Chinas biggest automaker is the largest Chinese EV player in Europe. One reason Chinese companies can offer highquality cars at affordable prices stems from the rules to enter the Chinese market. Chinese EV makers, meanwhile, are trying to stand out in a crowded field.|LONDON AP When Laima SpringeJanssen was looking to replace her Frenchmade gasolinepowered SUV with an electric car, she considered models from Volvo and Nissan. The Volvo extras she wanted would have busted her budget, while the Nissan lacked the wow factor. The Copenhagen, Denmark, resident ended up buying a compact SUV from Chinas BYD. I really, really love the car, SpringeJanssen said. For the equivalent of about 50,000, the Atto 3 SUV came with all these goodies like a 360degree dash cam, two years of free charging and an extra set of winter tires. Her husband likes it so much hes considering buying another BYD to replace their other car, from Volkswagens Skoda brand. Im sorry, Europe. Go home, she said. China has a better offer. Her enthusiasm underscores how Chinese automakers are winning over drivers as they make major inroads into Europes electric vehicle market, challenging longestablished homegrown brands in an industry thats key to the continents green energy transition. The competitive threat has spurred the European Union to launch an investigation into Beijings support for its EV industry. That adds to techrelated tensions between the West and China, which is one of Europes biggest trading partners and the worlds biggest auto market. Chinas EV onslaught, along with massive U.S. clean energy funding that has drawn investment away from Europe, shows how the 27nation bloc is caught in the middle of the global race for green technology. Chinese EV makers are drawn to Europe because auto import tariffs are just 10 versus 27.5 in the U.S., independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt said. Europe also has the worlds secondbiggest EV battery market after China. Nevermind the geopolitics. Climateconscious car buyers in Europe who are grappling with an increased cost of living rave about how Chinese EVs are affordable yet packed with features and stylish design. Concerns about the threat to local carmakers and jobs just arent a factor for them. British retiree John Kirkwood replaced his Volkswagen Passat three years ago with an MG5 station wagon because the 30,000pound 36,000 price tag wiped the floor with its nearest rival a Kia that cost thousands more. Its nice. Its quiet, its refined and very quick, Kirkwood said, adding that he had few qualms about British brand MGs Chinese ownership. MG owned by SAIC Motor, Chinas biggest automaker is the largest Chinese EV player in Europe. BYD, backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, is growing fast. Theres also Geely, which owns Swedens Volvo and a stable of EV brands including Polestar, Lynk Co. and British sportscar maker Lotus. Behind them are a slew of startups, like NIO and Xpeng. Their combined sales are a sliver of the 9.2 million vehicles sold in Europe every year, but they have been gobbling up a piece of the smaller EV market at an astonishing pace. Chinese automakers account for only about 3 of Western Europes overall car market but 8.4 of the EV market, up from 6.2 last year and almost nothing in 2019, according to Schmidts data. The surge is stoking fears about Europes automotive industry, an economic powerhouse centered in France and Germany that employs millions of workers, staying competitive as it transitions from fossil fuels to electricity. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars, with prices kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. The commission, the EUs executive arm, formally opened its investigation this month, saying it would take up to 13 months and could result in import duties. Beijing voiced strong dissatisfaction and vowed to firmly safeguard Chinese companies rights. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the EU probe is based on subjective assumptions, lacks enough evidence and goes against World Trade Organization rules. Complicating matters, global automakers build vehicles in China and have exported 164,300 this year to Europe, including BMWs iX3 SUV made in northeastern Shenyang and Teslas Model 3 and Y produced in Shanghai, according to Schmidts data. That means one in every five EVs sold in Europe is a Chinese import. A commission spokesman said the investigation is looking at Chinas EV exports regardless of the brand. Stellantis, which owns French auto brands Peugeot and Citroen as well as Italys Alfa Romeo and Fiat, is vowing to fight back against Chinas EVs. In a recent earnings call, CEO Carlos Tavares said the worlds No. 3 automaker is responding to a Chinese invasion in a European market with a new Citroen eC3 cheap compact. Stellantis faces added pressure from a union strike in the U.S. over EV battery plant jobs. Executives at Shanghaibased Aiways, a startup headed by Volvos former China sales chief, rejected accusations that Beijing provides a helping hand. Were not selling inside China, were not being subsidized in China, said Alexander Klose, vice president of overseas operations. Yes, we obviously have some subsidies for putting a plant somewhere, which is, I think, what everybody has in Europe. Aiways is focusing on Europe and Israel instead of China, where the auto market is so crowded that we dont think it makes sense to compete right now, Klose said. The EU should be working on getting to a green future rather than keeping competition out, he said. One reason Chinese companies can offer highquality cars at affordable prices stems from the rules to enter the Chinese market. Global automakers had to team up with local companies, providing them crucial automaking knowhow. They were kind of like the sous chefs to the Western companies, said Schmidt, the auto analyst. The situation now is those sous chefs are opening up their own restaurants and, in some cases, better than their masters restaurants. Also helping level the playing field is batterypowered motors being less complex to build than internal combustion engines and requiring fewer workers. Thats a problem for European brands with big workforces that will need years to revamp operations, Schmidt said. Chinese EV makers, meanwhile, are trying to stand out in a crowded field. SUV maker Great Wall Motors EV subbrand Ora is targeting women, with cars it says are designed for their body sizes and daily needs. The Ora Funky Cat, with throwback round headlights, an exclamation mark on its hood badge, and a 32,000pound 38,600 price tag, appealed to British scriptwriter Justin Nicholls, who bought one for his wife. The looks are awesome, and the tech great. Its so easy to drive, yet feels like a lot larger car and feels premium, he said. It also appealed to Nicholls because its different from the Volkswagens, Peugeots and BMWs common on British roads I think it is a lot more quirky than European cars.

Environment Canada has issued rainfall warnings for most of B.C.s South Coast including Metro Vancouver, most of Vancouver Island, Howe Sound, Whistler, and the Sea to Sky Highway from Squamish to Whistler, as an atmospheric river moves into the region. Global BC Senior meteorologist Kristi Gordon said the incoming system was classified at a rank of AR3 on a scale of one to five, according to the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. Thats significant enough to douse the region, but not as intense as some fall and winter storms B.C. has seen in recent years. 141 B.C.s South Coast in for a soaking as seasons first atmospheric river arrives Metro Vancouver is forecast to receive from 40 millimetres of rain up to 80 millimetres close to the North Shore mountains. Story continues below advertisement Meanwhile, the Sunshine Coast could get up to 60 millimetres, Howe Sound could get up to 110 millimetres, and Vancouver Island could get from up to 80 millimetres in the east to 200 millimetres on the west coast. Whistler and the Sea to Sky Highway area could also receive up to 110 millimetres. Gordon said the heavy rain was forecast to stretch over a 36 to 48hour period from Tuesday evening into Wednesday. B.C.s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change also issued a bulletin Tuesday evening, warning that the heavy rain could cause other hazards, following a summer of drought and wildfires. 539 Heavy rain after summer drought raises flood risk Rainfall on impacted areas can generate high surface water runoff and erosion due to a lack of vegetation, leading to a possibility of localized flooding and landslides although widespread or severe impacts are not expected as part of this atmospheric river system, the ministry said in a media release. Story continues below advertisement The B.C. River Forecast Centre has also issued highstreamflow advisories for multiple regions, rivers and their tributaries, including the South Coast, North Thompson, South Thompson, Upper Columbia, Vancouver Island, Sunshine Coast, and Howe Sound. People are being urged to stay away from fastmoving waterways and not to drive through flood water. The province is also using the storm as a chance to reiterate its emergency preparedness advice, including preparing homes for possible flooding by clearing storm drains, gutters and perimeters and packing grabandgo bags that can be used for any emergency situation. Global News spoke with Environment Canada meteorologist Alyssa Charbonneau, on Wednesday. Atmospheric rivers are more common in B.C.s fall. It is one of the ways that recharges our rainfall after relatively dry summers, she said. They are very narrow bands of highintensity moisture, and as it approaches the coast and the mountains it releases its rain. Charbonneau said now is a good time to check drainage around homes and neighbourhoods to help mitigate localized flooding.|1

Environment Canada says winds gusting up to 110 kmh are expected over Haida Gwaii, the Central Coast and northern Vancouver Island. Heavy rain is also forecast for Kitimat on the North Coast, as well as most of Vancouver Island and the Howe Sound region north of Vancouver. Rainfall accumulations of 70 millimetres in Kitimat and more than 200 millimetres on western Vancouver Island are likely before the storm eases early Thursday and the weather office says localized flooding is possible, along with potential washouts near rivers, creeks and culverts. People are pictured during a period of heavy rain in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia on Monday, October 16, 2023. High streamflow advisories are in place for Vancouver Island, Howe Sound, Thompson, Columbia and the Howe Sound regions. Ben NelmsCBC Alyssa Charbonneau, meteorologist with Environment Canada, said the system is a narrow atmospheric river that will miss the Metro Vancouver area, where rainfall is expected to be heaviest on the North Shore, with levels diminishing eastward into the Fraser Valley. We do have a warning out for Howe Sound where we could see 50 to 70 millimetres of rainfall with this system. And parts of Metro Vancouver will likely see some good rainfall as well, she said. Following a severe wildfire season, heavy rain could generate high surface water runoff and erosion, which could then lead to localized flooding and landslides, the B.C. government said in a statement. It is important that everyone take steps to prepare for seasonal storms, regardless of where they are located in the province, reads the statement, which warns residents to stay away from riverbanks and prepare in case of floods. The province notes, however, that widespread or severe impacts are not expected with the incoming storm system. The River Forecast Centre has issued a high streamflow advisory for waterways on Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast and Howe Sound, warning of flows seen every two to five years. Story continues An additional high streamflow advisory was posted for the North and South Thompson and Upper Columbia River basins in the Central Interior. Current weather modelling is indicating the potential for heavier rainfall rates up to 50 mm in areas around Revelstoke and surrounding areas to the west and east, reads the advisory. A travel advisory has also been posted for Highway 4 east of Port Alberni, and road crews are watching carefully, as heavy rain could wash debris onto the road from the cliffs above, where a wildfire damaged trees and destabilized the soil earlier this year and caused extended road closures.|1

Waiting to hear back from Guinness for confirmation, Rouble believes he is the furthest to paddle in a pumpkin boat on the Great Lakes.|I fought for every metre Despite missing the Guinness World Record, enthusiastic gardener Brent Rouble paddled 23 km in his giant pumpkin on Sunday SAULT STE. MARIE He may not have broken the Guinness World Record for furthest distance travelled in a pumpkin boat, but Sault resident Brent Rouble couldnt be happier for the memorable experience he had this weekend. After growing a 900pound pumpkin in his eastend backyard, the local geologist managed to paddle in the giant plant for just over 23 kilometres along St. Marys River and the open waters of Lake Huron on Sunday before some tough waves forced him to stop. His eightandahalfhour journey with virtually no breaks began in front of an excited crowd yesterday morning at the Bellevue Marina. With the support of Thrive Tours and a safety crew team led by his friend Kyle Scali, Roubles trek came to a bittersweet end near Echo Bay around 430 p.m. Although he was feeling slightly sore this morning, Rouble says the temporary pain is beyond worth it. It was such a cool adventure the sights were absolutely beautiful, he told SooToday. That was seriously the best pumpkin a guy could ask for in doing something like this. It was tough as nails, it floated perfectly, and it was stable. I didnt feel worried about tipping at all. While his unconventional water craft miraculously withstood a number of challenges over the course of that afternoon, high waves and luckless currents inevitably made the goal of breaking the 62kilometre world record an impossibility. I fought for every metre, he says. I thought the wind would help, but for half the trip, the wind was actually against me. The current didnt help either it was working against us the whole time. Some of the waves were coming into the pumpkin and getting me pretty soaked as well. But its a world record its not supposed to be easy. Rouble achieved a maximum speed of five kilometreshour, or walking speed, but there were times he was only travelling one kilometrehour or less. His average speed finished at just over two kilometreshour, which meant he would have had to paddle for more than 30 hours at that pace to claim the record. I was literally crawling to St. Joseph Island, he says. The speed just wasnt enough. The currents really were the only thing that didnt go right through all of this. I knew it wasnt going to be safe to go all through the night and into the morning. Despite some hardship along the way, the passionate gardener says he felt all the good vibes from his supporters which helped greatly. There were strangers coming from Bruce Mines and Thessalon to see this crazy guy in a pumpkin, he says. I heard people on the Canadian side yelling go Brent go sometimes, which was a huge help because it definitely got tough. American boaters were passing us, and we saw them doing double takes since they were wondering what we were doing which was pretty funny. Preparing to do it all again next year, Rouble says hes looking for a sponsor to help his team travel to the Grand River in southern Ontario as he hopes to grow an even larger pumpkin and break the distance record there. Thrive Tours said that would be a good river to break the world record, he says. You need fastmoving water, and pumpkins do not paddle well theyre too big and too round. Unless you have fast water, you wont be moving that quickly. If I can grow a pumpkin with a bit of legroom, I could go for days, he laughed. Waiting to hear back from Guinness for confirmation, Rouble believes he is the furthest to paddle in a pumpkin boat on the Great Lakes. While hes unlikely to attempt that water system again, he encourages anyone up to the challenge to give it a try. Its definitely not easy, but it is beatable, he says. If anyone wants to beat it, just grow a giant pumpkin and pick a good day for currents. Grateful for the communitys response to his bold venture, Rouble is hopeful his story will help inspire the younger generation to always think big. I heard stories about kids getting pumped up about this, he says. Some of them were curious about world records and even about gardening. Im hoping we inspired some kids to do some good in the community.|1

The waves were coming right over the sandbar out there. I couldnt see the sandbar there was that much water and today you can see it and its breached, said Stan Peach, Glace Bay, N.S. resident. More than 100 millimetres of rain fell on parts of Cape Breton late Sunday through Monday. The breach means water can now access the pond behind the beach and allow it to flow closer to infrastructure and houses. Every property along here is in jeopardy, said Peach. Including an historic one room school house built in 1888. For the first time, ocean water reached the property. The water was right up to the road, Seaside Drive, so thats a sign of whats to come unless something is done here, said Darren Bruckschwaiger, CBRM councilor. Dominion Beach is provincially owned. Bruckswaiger says a protective rock wall was built in 2010, by the NDP government at the time, as the first part of a threephase plan. The wall has helped protect a building on the grounds and the parking lot, but he says the two other phases were never completed. Its something Ive been fighting for 25 years. I spoke to a lot of politicians, premiers, ministers, and a lot of nice people, but its been nothing but lip service and nothing has been done here, he added. At one time, Dominion Beach was the second most popular beach in the province, with tens of thousands of people visiting each year. Ive had my kids on that, my grandkids on that and people are not going to be able to do that anymore. They are not going to be able to spend the time there that I spent with my kids, its too bad, said Peach. A spokesperson for the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables says they are considering options for sustainable park management.

He brought some eggs inside, then heard a loud crash minutes later. I went outside to investigate and the hillside had come down, and completely buried my chicken house, he said. The landslide didnt topple his house but districtappointed engineers later deemed it unsafe to return to, citing a high risk of further landslides. A report shared with CBC News said the slides, which occurred during the historic 2021 atmospheric river event, were effects of much more widespread and deepseated slope movement that will lead to a larger landslide in the future. The Fraser Valley Regional District says at least six property owners in the Chilliwack River valley are in a similar situation, unable to return to their homes, which have effectively been rendered unlivable. Theyve been denied insurance payouts and have not been provided with provincial Disaster Financial Assistance DFA. They fall through the cracks they dont qualify for DFA, said Patti MacAhonic, elected district director of the area. Its two years almost. These people are salt of the earth people. Theyre taxpayers, they need to have some resolution here. MacAhonic says some of the homes were destroyed, others are still standing but unsafe to live in. Despite that, some residents continue to live in them because they have nowhere else to go. Theyre right below a slide that could give way at any time, she said. They dont feel safe, but they dont feel they have any other options, so theyre really stressed out living in their homes. Every time it rains, they get really stressed out. The district is calling for a buyout of the properties. The assessed value of the six properties in 2021 was under 5 million. Erv Warkentin walks through his backyard, where a landlside toppled his chicken coop during 2021s atmospheric river event. Jon HernandezCBC District timeline According to the district, the Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness EMCR advised them that DFA funding would not be available to these residents since no physical damage exists. In late December 2022, residents had been told that Public Safety Minister and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth agreed to a nonDFA course of action. In early 2023, EMCR sent its own engineering consultants to conduct further assessments of the six properties and make recommendations on whether mitigation works are possible. In May, residents were informed that mitigation works are not feasible. The district says it has yet to hear further details from the province on how residents might be compensated. Warkentin says its been two steady years of hope followed by disappointment. Its like basically dangling a carrot in front of you all the time, he said. On Monday, B.C.s environment and climate change minister said discussions are ongoing. Im aware of these six individuals. We are in conversations with the district, and in addition to that, Minister Bowinn Ma and I will have further discussions with our colleagues, said George Heyman. In a statement, an EMCR spokesperson said some properties with landsliderelated damages from the atmospheric river event have received DFA supports. However, it noted DFA does not cover potential future physical damages and losses. Holmes says his home slid off its foundation.

Their house is off its foundation because of the slide. The B.C. assessment of my property is 1 for the house, 1 for the acre of land, for a total value of 2, he said. He says he feels like the valley residents have been left behind. Its like dealing with a black hole, he added. A lot of emails are not even acknowledged.|1

As inundation spreads, the effects will be felt predominantly by lowerincome people as habitable areas shrink and housing prices rise, says the study. Only a small number of affluent residents will be able relocate from lowlying or waterfront properties, while many others without sufficient means may be trapped there, it says. The study was just published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Interested in Environmental News Subscribe to our free Environmental Tools Techniques newsletter. Most studies focus on the direct effects of inundation, said lead author Nadia Seeteram, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia Universitys LamontDoherty Earth Observatory. Here, we were able to look at flooding on a very granular level, and add in other vulnerabilities. The study combines buildingbybuilding projections of flooding caused by direct sealevel rise, rainfall or storm surge with finegrained demographic data to determine how residents will be affected. Along with flood maps, the researchers used U.S. Census Bureau data to chart economic and social factors that would make people more or less vulnerable, including age, race, level of education, income and status of employment, and whether they owned or rented their homes, among other measures. They then divided the population into four categories. With a onemeter sealevel increasea middleoftheroad scenario for the end of this century56 percent of the population, primarily on higher ground, could face pressures to relocate, they say. The researchers call these people displaced. The next largest group they labeled the trappedsome 19 percent of the population, living in chronically flooded territory, but without the means to flee to safer nearby ground. About another 19 percent would be stable, according to the researchersliving in areas not prone to flooding and able to remain there. Just seven percentbasically the wealthiest, which the researchers labeled as migratingwould be directly exposed to flooding in waterfront or lowlying areas, but able to move to safer spots within the metro area. Not surprisingly, the study says that if sea levels rise even more than a meter, direct flooding, not economic pressures, will become the dominant force affecting residents. At two metersfairly high amid the current range of estimates, but not out of the questionabout 55 percent of the population will be directly inundated through a combination of high sea level and, to an increasing extent, rainfall. Under this scenario, 49 percent of the population would become trapped, and 25 percent displaced. Only eight percent would be classified as stable. This is where it gets to be more drastic, more existential, said Seeteram, who did much of the research during her PhD studies at Florida International University. In either scenario, she said, the results would include potential depopulation of the area and devaluation of flooded properties, as people flee to safer inland regions. This could make it increasingly difficult for authorities to collect taxes to fund adaptations of infrastructure to keep the ocean at baya circular process that could send MiamiDade into an increasingly dire downward spiral, both physical and fiscal. The study does not look at how many people are currently being affected by flooding, either directly or indirectly. But floods have already become a routine part of life, as monthly peaks in tides percolate up through the sewers during socalled sunny day flooding, and rain with nowhere to drain pools in streets. The kind of flash flooding in New York City that made big news after a big storm at the end of September would be viewed as just another day in parts of Miami during the MayOctober wet season, said Seeteram. A still unpublished survey by Seeteram and colleagues indicates that nearly three quarters of Miamians say they have been personally affected by flooding from rainfall in one way or another. There are also some indications that socalled climate gentrificationthe displacement of lowerincome people from higherelevation areas predicted by the studyis already taking place. For instance, in the last few years, the Little Haiti neighborhood, a relatively lofty 10 feet above sea level, has seen a sudden surge in development and property values, worrying the largely Black residents that they may not be able to remain. Study coauthor Katharine Mach of the University of Miami said there is a great, raging debate about whether climate gentrification is underway. I suspect it is already happening, she said. However, she said, at least for now, other factors may be playing larger roles in rapidly shifting realestate values, including longtime prodevelopment policies and what she calls realestate tourism, with speculators snapping up relatively inexpensive properties in a still booming region. The question is, what fraction of rising prices can you put on climate she said. She pointed out that realestate prices are also going up in lowlying and waterfront areas, but not as fast as in less floodprone areasone possible indicator that predicted sealevel rise is playing a role in buyers decisions. Seteeram said the projections in the new study may not necessarily come to pass, at least with lower estimates of sealevel rise it depends on how the metro area confronts the problems in coming years. If it revamps infrastructure to lessen flooding and takes other measures, that could blunt the effects, she said. We could see different kinds of housing development, to make the population denser in some areas, or more climate resilient. But then you would have to see what the intersection would be with affordability for a lot of people.

When developing a new area, there are many factors developers, municipalities and other entities must consider, including basic amenities such as water, sewage, hydro, and internet access. Other considerations include whether new developments and communities are safe and resilient to the threat of climate change and if they affect environmentally sensitive areas. According to the Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment technical report, the biggest climate changerelated threats to development are precipitation and wildfires. Both hazards have the potential to damage buildings and shorten the service life of infrastructure such as bridges and roads. In the past two years alone, several areas in North America have experienced historic precipitation, resulting in damaging floods. In July 2023, Nova Scotia experienced record rainfall, causing approximately 170 million in damage to homes, roads and bridges, and four lives being lost. While flooding is a regular occurrence in isolated parts of Manitoba, the province experienced widespread flooding in 2022. This year, Boston experienced the secondwettest summer in recorded history, and many parts of Massachusetts saw flooding. Residents were asked to avoid contact with rivers and beaches as untreated sewage was released with stormwater. Back at home, AdjalaTosoronto, Mono, New Tecumseth and Shelburne experienced significant flooding in June 2017. Crops were badly damaged, causing lost profits for farmers around the area. The emergency spillway at the Tottenham Dam also suffered excessive damage and has since been repaired. A number of roads were closed for a short period of time. Although the water was just three to six inches deep, the water took about a week to drain from the fields. In Ontario, conservation authorities are responsible for protecting lives and properties from flood and erosion. In the Nottawasaga watershed, this starts with ensuring development is not built in floodplains and other spaces that are prone to flooding and erosion. These areas include rivers, streams and wetlands. During the building process, it is important to take certain precautions to ensure floodplains, slopes and wetlands are not affected. The Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority NVCA works with land developers to ensure these precautions are implemented, and that new development does not create flooding and erosion effects on our communities. In our September Village Media column, we mentioned the important role wetlands play in flood reduction and providing important wildlife habitat. This is also true for natural areas beside rivers and streams. Wetlands are crucial habitat features for wildlife, providing a unique environment where various plant and animal species thrive. The sheltered water and abundant plant life offer ideal conditions for fish and amphibians to lay their eggs and for young animals to grow. Wetlands are also critical stopover points for migratory birds, offering them a place to rest and refuel during long journeys.

Its been 30 years since the Great World Flood, which left most of the country blanketed by water. In an effort to keep the 100,000 remaining residents of Winnipeg safe, the city has been walled off from whichever pockets of society remain. The Winnipeg you know, love and tolerate is gone in Glad to Be Here, the upcoming project from the everinventive Theatre by the River in the companys first show since 2021s Meet Me at Dawn. Andrea del Campo from left, Karl Thordarson, Michael Lawrenchuk and Mel Marginet live in the waterlogged New Winnipeg in Glad to Be Here. Mike Deal Winnipeg Free Press In New Winnipeg, Polo Park is drowning, The Forks are swimming and there is so much water on Portage Avenue that the skywalks are sidewalks instead. Theatre Preview Glad to Be Here Theatre by the River Portage Avenue Church, 1420 Portage Ave. Opens Thursday, runs to Saturday. Oct. 28 Tickets 1637 at wfp.togladtobehere Theatre by the River, founded in 2005, has spent the last two decades dedicated to making work that gets people talking, says artistic director Mel Marginet. And by honing in on a climate disaster that feels somewhat farfetched but also somewhat realistic, the company hopes its latest production leads people to question where they are, who they are and how even a city can disappear under the crash of a tidal wave. Glad to Be Here started in 2019, when creators Marginet, Daina Leitold, Derek Leenhouts and Karl Thordarson gathered to create a show about here and now, Marginet says. The group knew it wanted to tackle questions about the rise of alternate facts and online conspiracy theories. They put on their tinfoil hats, and began to imagine what kind of calamity Winnipeg would succumb to. We did the science, Leitold says they figured out a flood would be the likeliest culprit, with waters flowing into the city from Hudson Bay. We got all heady imagining what that world would look like, she adds, with the group certain there was enough material for a futuristic, dystopian narrative. But then we said you know what we need A playwright. Its good to have someone at the helm to steer the ship. So the company enlisted the awardwinning playwright Ginny Collins The Flats to work her magic. The resulting story is set in New Winnipeg, which after 30 years of isolation is opening its gates to wanderers from other territories across the country seeking refuge. Director, Jacquie Loewen left and Production Designer, Daina Leitold right enjoy some Jeannes Cake between rehearsals. Mike Deal Winnipeg Free Press Cassandra Patricia Hunter is the mysterious leader, written by Collins as the mouthpiece for a sales pitch for new settlers to come to the only remaining Prairie metropolis. Its the first time anyone has been invited in to see behind these walls, says Leitold, who serves as production designer, creating waterproof costumes for the cast and procuring lifejackets for audience members. The shows creators insist there is no Splash Zone, because that would ruin the carpets at the Portage Avenue Church. Its a massive production, with a cast of eight live performers, nine video performers and five audio performers, including Michael Lawrenchuk, Andrea del Campo, Lara Rae, Jordan Phillips and Gabriel Daniels. Ginny was able to take those initial thoughts and ideas and create characters who are very good representations of those ideas, not as ideological representatives, but as actual human beings, says Jacquie Loewen, the productions director. Glad to Be Here has plenty of moving parts, which made Loewen, one of the citys most indemand stagefight coordinators, an ideal choice to direct a performance centred on the global fight against climate change. In this world weve imagined, Portage Place is vitally important, says Leitold, slipping into a sales pitch. All food is grown there, thanks to its natural greenhouse effect, and it can store and purify water in these gorgeous fountains. You will arrive to a lively, active, colourful tradeshow event where we are going to wow you with the sights, sounds, tastes, smells and the touches of New Winnipeg. Its a feast for the senses. The show doesnt require audience participation, but it is a production that will benefit from the guests buying into the concept, Loewen says. I use this term very carefully, but this is a style that requires you as an audience member to be a part of the show, she says. Youre not required to do anything other than listen, but the fact is, your presence there is what makes the show happen, which Ive come to realize is a very potent esthetic choice. Theatre by the River, founded in 2005, has spent the last two decades dedicated to making work that gets people talking, says artistic director Mel Marginet. Mike Deal Winnipeg Free Press Even if the audience is mute, which they should be, they will still be within this immersive world, this imagined future place inhabited by humans who are humaning to the best of their abilities. It becomes unavoidable that the audience leaves feeling complicit and questioning where they were. The shows creators had to imagine how humans would react in such an apocalyptic setting. When they first began talking about the show in 2019, some of those reactions seemed ridiculous, says Marginet. Any time you write something futuristic, you inevitably ask, Would this actually happen But we lived through Toilet Paper Gate, she says. The upheaval and instability of the COVID19 pandemic, Marginet says, allowed us to let our imaginations go and not be inhibited by reality. ben.waldmanwinnipegfreepress.com|1

Environment Canada says winds gusting up to 110 kmh are expected over Haida Gwaii, the Central Coast and northern Vancouver Island. Heavy rain is also forecast for Kitimat on the North Coast, as well as most of Vancouver Island and the Howe Sound region north of Vancouver. Rainfall accumulations of 70 millimetres in Kitimat and more than 200 millimetres on western Vancouver Island are likely before the storm eases early Thursday and the weather office says localized flooding is possible, along with potential washouts near rivers, creeks and culverts. High streamflow advisories are in place for Vancouver Island, Howe Sound, Thompson, Columbia and the Howe Sound regions. Ben NelmsCBC Alyssa Charbonneau, meteorologist with Environment Canada, said the system is a narrow atmospheric river that will miss the Metro Vancouver area, where rainfall is expected to be heaviest on the North Shore, with levels diminishing eastward into the Fraser Valley. We do have a warning out for Howe Sound where we could see 50 to 70 millimetres of rainfall with this system. And parts of Metro Vancouver will likely see some good rainfall as well, she said. Following a severe wildfire season, heavy rain could generate high surface water runoff and erosion, which could then lead to localized flooding and landslides, the B.C. government said in a statement. It is important that everyone take steps to prepare for seasonal storms, regardless of where they are located in the province, reads the statement, which warns residents to stay away from riverbanks and prepare in case of floods. The province notes, however, that widespread or severe impacts are not expected with the incoming storm system. The River Forecast Centre has issued a high streamflow advisory for waterways on Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast and Howe Sound, warning of flows seen every two to five years. An additional high streamflow advisory was posted for the North and South Thompson and Upper Columbia River basins in the Central Interior. Current weather modelling is indicating the potential for heavier rainfall rates up to 50 mm in areas around Revelstoke and surrounding areas to the west and east, reads the advisory. A travel advisory has also been posted for Highway 4 east of Port Alberni, and road crews are watching carefully, as heavy rain could wash debris onto the road from the cliffs above, where a wildfire damaged trees and destabilized the soil earlier this year and caused extended road closures.|1

Further discussion items in the coming weeks will include topics such as compensation and bilateral treatyecosystem provisions. If an agreementinprinciple is reached, the Province will collect feedback from B.C. Columbia Basin residents and First Nations on any proposed terms. The B.C. government has been speaking with First Nations in the basin, local governments and the public since 2012 to learn what they want to see changed in a modernized treaty. Nothing will be finalized until the people of the Columbia Basin have been consulted. Originally ratified in 1964, the Columbia River Treaty is a watersharing agreement between Canada and the U.S. that provide for downstream flood control management and power generation on the Columbia River. The treaty led to the construction of three dams in British Columbia and one in Montana. However, it has been historically criticized for a lack of consultation with Indigenous communities, as the reservoirs flooded out cultural and heritage sites, and impacted ecosystems, forests, agriculture and tourism values. While the original main elements of the treaty emphasized flood control and power generation, ecosystem function and habitat impacts from hydropower operations has become a significant new discussion point led by Indigenous Nations in the modernization talks.|0

More than 80 million or close to 25 per cent of these losses went toward replacing or repairing stormdamaged vehicles. Ontarians once again experienced a summer of severe storms and floods that damaged or destroyed homes, vehicles and businesses, said Amanda Dean, interim vicepresident, Ontario, Insurance Bureau of Canada IBC. While much of southern Ontario was affected, the Ottawa region was hardest hit by these summer storms, with intense flash flooding, torrential downpours and violent wind gusts. Our member insurers have been on the ground since day one and continue to work with the large number of policyholders whose property was damaged by these events. The frequency and severity of flooding and severe storms in Ontario and across Canada continue to increase each year, IBC said. The following storms from the summer of 2023 have been designated catastrophes, which is used to describe insured damage estimates that total more than 30 million. The highest damages were seen in the following areas On July 2021, a cold front crossing southern Ontario and Quebec led to an outbreak of severe thunderstorms, causing more than 30 million in damage. Storms produced strong wind gusts, including two confirmed tornadoes near South Buxton and Petrolia, as well as large hailstones and downpours that caused flooding. A microburst in Sarnia caused significant damage, including downed trees and power lines and damaged outdoor furniture and fences. On July 2829, a period of hot, humid weather resulted in severe thunderstorms across southern Ontario, causing more than 30 million in damage. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed on July 28 and 29, with some of the strongest storms hitting the Ottawa region. Ottawa was pelted by hail up to the size of tennis balls, while strong winds brought down trees in Windsor. Heavy downpours also led to flash flooding. On Aug. 3, a summertime frontal system moving through southern Ontario sparked severe thunderstorms, causing more than 100 million in damage. The hardesthit areas saw large hailstones, violent wind gusts and torrential downpours. Lindsay and Ottawa were among the most significantly impacted regions. On Aug. 10, a cold front sliding through southeastern Ontario sparked a series of thunderstorms across the Ottawa region, targeting parts of the city with an intense burst of rainfall that caused flash flooding. The event caused more than 70 million in damage. While much of southern Ontario witnessed storms related to this front, conditions produced heavy rainfall over parts of the Ottawa region. A swath from Nepean to Carson Grove was the hardest hit, with streets turning to rivers as storms moved from southwest to northeast across the city, leaving vehicles submerged and businesses flooded. On Aug. 2325, moisture associated with the remnants of Hurricane Hilary fed thunderstorms over southwestern Ontario, causing more than 110 million. This led to a series of heavy storms, producing significant rainfall, multiple tornadoes and large hailstones. More than 200 millimeters of rain fell on some communities, resulting in flooded roads, basements and properties.|1

The intake of cats from the past four days has far surpassed the weekly average from the past few weeks, and rivals the number of cats who are admitted during the busiest weeks of the summer. The OHS said the flood of felines was unexpected and is creating additional strain on the humane societys resources. The cats have a wide range of needs, Dr. Shelley Hutchings, the OHS chief veterinarian said in a written news release. From a spayneuter surgery, dental procedure, and some more complex, urgent cases, our team is working hard to provide for these animals and prepare them for adoption. Some of the cats were surrendered by owners who could no longer care for their pet, while some of them were found lost and alone. The cats include nursing mothers with newborn kittens, as well as a pair of kittens found lost and alone at Tanger Outlets in Kanata. The humane society is currently treating those two kittens for an upper respiratory infection, also known as a cat cold. Even the cats with no additional medical needs still require daytoday shelter and care while they wait for adoption. Right now, more foster homes and adopters would make a huge difference for the animals, explained Dr. Hutchings. Foster volunteers make it possible for us to care for even more animals. We provide all the food, supplies and veterinary care the pet needs. The foster volunteer provides a temporary home.

Puis dimanche, de la pluie supplmentaire pour un total de 120 millimtres. Cest exceptionnel et a narrive pas souvent , plaide le maire de SaintBruno, Ludovic Gris Farand. En comparaison, le territoire a reu 27 mm de pluie pendant tout le mois de septembre. Pour M. Gris Farand, le contraste est norme . En entrevue, il confirme des problmes sur les rues JulietteBliveau et des Tilleuls. Nous avons reu des appels de citoyens inonds dans ces deux rues.

The trees arrived with Polynesian voyagers. After Maui wildfire, theres a chance to restore them Article content LAHAINA, Hawaii AP For people around the world, the green leaves that sprouted from a scorched, 150yearold banyan tree in the heart of devastated Lahaina symbolized hope following Mauis deadly wildfire this summer. Teams rushed to flood its roots with water, hoping to save a magnificent tree that had provided shade for community events, a picturesque wedding venue and a popular backdrop for posing tourists. But the fire also nearly wiped out another set of trees, one with a much longer history in Lahaina and a greater significance in Hawaiian culture breadfruit, or ulu, which had given sustenance since Polynesian voyagers introduced it to the islands many centuries ago. Before colonialism, commercial agriculture and tourism, thousands of breadfruit trees dotted Lahaina the fire charred all but two of the dozen or so that remained.

They see the destruction as a chance to restore the trees to Lahaina, to teach about their care and use, and to reclaim a bit of the towns historic identity amid a larger discussion about whether the communitys reconstruction will price out locals and Hawaiian culture in favor of deeppocketed outsiders seeking a slice of tropical paradise. Even in this tragedy and the destruction, there is a lot of hope in our communities that there is opportunity here to bring awareness and appreciation and incorporation of some of our values and history and identity, said Noa Kekuewa Lincoln, an associate researcher of indigenous crops at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The banyan tree at the center of Lahaina was a sapling when it was planted in 1873 a quarter century before the Hawaiian Islands became a U.S. territory and seven decades after King Kamehameha declared Lahaina the capital of his kingdom. It was a gift shipped from India to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first Protestant mission in Lahaina. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The sprawling tree is beloved, towering more than 60 feet 18 meters and spanning nearly an acre with aerial roots descending from its boughs. It has provided shade for locals and tourists alike in a town whose name means relentless sun. But for some it also continues to represent the colonization that eventually transformed Lahaina into a travel destination. By contrast, researchers believe breadfruit and kukui nut now the state tree of Hawaii were among the many edible plants Polynesian voyagers brought around 1,000 years ago. Such imports could have been carried across the ocean, wrapped in rotted coconut husk and dried leaves and protected in a woven coconut basket. Kukui nut oil was used for torches kukui is known as the tree of light. Other uses included wood for canoes, dyes for tattoos and bark infusions for preserving fish nets. Ulu can grow to 60 feet 18 meters tall, with large dark green leaves, and each can bear hundreds of pounds of breadfruit. A staple in some tropical countries, the fruit looks like an oversized, scaly lime. It is typically eaten cooked and is starchy, like potatoes or bread. It has a short shelf life, rotting within 48 hours of ripening. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Kaipo Kekona, a ninthgeneration Lahaina native, has led efforts to restore its ancient food forests for several years. He said ulu can be made into dishes resembling mashed potatoes, French fries, mousse, hummus, cakes, pies and chips, and that it can help ensure food security when other industries fail, such as tourism during the pandemic or after the wildfire. When we look at reforestation efforts in our town, reclamation of ulu and its historical value, it can be complemented by the evolving palates of our community, Kekona said. The footprint of the burn zone largely overlaps what is known in Hawaiian history as Malu ulu o Lele the shaded breadfruit grove of Lele, Lele being an earlier name for Lahaina. By the late 19th century many of those trees had been burned to make way for sugar plantations. Fresh water sources at streams and canals were diverted. Development transformed the landscape into a tourism destination with far fewer trees. Efforts to revive the banyan and other important surviving trees have included trucking in water, applying compost extract and testing soil. The volunteers working to save Lahainas breadfruit have dug down to extract viable root matter. In one case, they peeled back asphalt that butted against a charred breadfruit trunk. Underground, they found life. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The samples they collected are now in a University of Hawaii lab in Hilo, on the Big Island. Lincoln projects hundreds of trees could be propagated, with seeds or saplings given to homeowners seeking to replant their properties. But replanting breadfruit in urban areas comes with challenges, said Steve Nimz, an arborist on Oahu who has been helping restore Lahainas trees. When ripe breadfruit falls, it splats and rots in an unsightly, gooey, fragrant mess. Trees planted near a sidewalk or public area could pose a threat to passersby, as some varieties have fruits weighing up to 12 pounds 5.5 kg. Falling breadfruit can cause serious injury. You probably dont want to put breadfruit in a really high traffic area, said Hokuao Pellegrino, an ethnobotanist who has helped in the volunteer effort and who has 22 breadfruit trees on his own farm in Waikapu, on the other side of the West Maui Mountains from Lahaina. But restoring some of the breadfruit groves as part of the individual homeowners landscape, now that is a worthy cause, because those can be managed a little bit better.

Article content Pellegrino said the efforts to replant breadfruit in Lahaina should also come with efforts to teach people about its care and its uses We want people to use the breadfruit. We dont want it just to be in the landscape. But for now, many are more focused on housing and cleaning up after the disaster than on what trees to eventually plant. Pellegrino, who calls himself an outsider because hes not from Lahaina, says reintegrating breadfruit and restoring wetlands, canals and streams could bring a new future for the town. Its about reclaiming the identity of that place, Pellegrino said. Komenda reported from Tacoma, Washington. Article content Share this article in your social network Read Next|1

The Volvo extras she wanted would have busted her budget, while the Nissan lacked the wow factor. The Copenhagen, Denmark, resident ended up buying a compact SUV from Chinas BYD. I really, really love the car, SpringeJanssen said. For the equivalent of about 50,000, the Atto 3 SUV came with all these goodies like a 360degree dash cam, two years of free charging and an extra set of winter tires. Her husband likes it so much hes considering buying another BYD to replace their other car, from Volkswagens Skoda brand. Im sorry, Europe. Go home, she said. China has a better offer. Her enthusiasm underscores how Chinese automakers are winning over drivers as they make major inroads into Europes electric vehicle market, challenging longestablished homegrown brands in an industry thats key to the continents green energy transition. The competitive threat has spurred the European Union to launch an investigation into Beijings support for its EV industry. That adds to techrelated tensions between the West and China, which is one of Europes biggest trading partners and the worlds biggest auto market. Chinas EV onslaught, along with massive U.S. clean energy funding that has drawn investment away from Europe, shows how the 27nation bloc is caught in the middle of the global race for green technology. Chinese EV makers are drawn to Europe because auto import tariffs are just 10 percent versus 27.5 percent in the U.S., independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt said. Europe also has the worlds secondbiggest EV battery market after China. Nevermind the geopolitics. Climateconscious car buyers in Europe who are grappling with an increased cost of living rave about how Chinese EVs are affordable yet packed with features and stylish design. Concerns about the threat to local carmakers and jobs just arent a factor for them. MG, owned by SAIC Motor, Chinas biggest automaker, is the largest Chinese EV player in Europe. BYD, backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, is growing fast. Theres also Geely, which owns Swedens Volvo and a stable of EV brands including Polestar, Lynk Co. and British sportscar maker Lotus. Behind them are a slew of startups, like NIO and Xpeng. Their combined sales are a sliver of the 9.2 million vehicles sold in Europe every year, but they have been gobbling up a piece of the smaller EV market at an astonishing pace. Chinese automakers account for only about 3 percent of Western Europes overall car market but 8.4 percent of the EV market, up from 6.2 percent last year and almost nothing in 2019, according to Schmidts data. The surge is stoking fears about Europes automotive industry, an economic powerhouse centered in France and Germany that employs millions of workers, staying competitive as it transitions from fossil fuels to electricity. One reason Chinese companies can offer highquality cars at affordable prices stems from the rules to enter the Chinese market. Global automakers had to team up with local companies, providing them crucial automaking knowhow. Also helping level the playing field is batterypowered motors being less complex to build than internal combustion engines and requiring fewer workers. Thats a problem for European brands with big workforces that will need years to revamp operations, Schmidt said.|1

The BC River Forecast Centre issued the advisory for the areas Wednesday morning, which includes areas around Squamish and Whistler. They join advisories previously issued for Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast, and Howe Sound. A high streamflow advisory means that river levels are rising or are expected to rise rapidly, but major flooding is not expected. Additionally, flood watches have been issued for West Vancouver Island and the Englishman River north of Nanaimo. A map showing the areas of B.C. under streamflow advisories or flood watch. Courtesy BC River Forecast Centre The River Forecast Centre says a Pacific weather system is bringing significant subtropical moisture to the coastal regions of the province. Ongoing rises in river levels are expected throughout Wednesday and potentially overnight in areas. Minor localized flooding and road washouts are possible, the centre said. Dave Campbell, head of the BC River Forecast Centre, says the amount of rainfall seen in the past day is significant. It almost seems about a third of normal rainfall wed see in the last six months has happened in the last day, he told CityNews. He advises those near rivers and other bodies of water to take caution, as water levels can change quickly. For people who might be out and about, we think this is going to be a real change in the rivers. Were going to see this rapid rise and from a safety perspective, remaining cautious around rivers is important at this time, he said. On the drought front, Campbell says the rain will help river levels get back to normal, but things like groundwater will take longer to recover. Were still trying to get a handle on the longerterm implication. I think thats the one where it can be a little more subtle in terms of the longerterm drought things, he explained. The weather system has already prompted a rainfall warning to be issued for Metro Vancouver.

Rainfall warnings cover most of Vancouver Island, as well as the Sunshine Coast, Howe Sound, Whistler and Metro Vancouver as Environment Canada pinpoints a firehoselike band pumping moisture from the subtropics directly at the B.C. coast. More than 200 millimetres of rain could fall along sections of western Vancouver Island, while 80 to 110 millimetres are forecast across the Howe Sound, Whistler and SeatoSky regions before the storm is expected to ease late in the day. Up to 80 millimetres could drench Metro Vancouver, and the weather office says localized flooding in lowlying areas is possible everywhere the warnings are posted. The rainshadow effect will protect much of the Interior from heavy downpours, but a special weather statement covers the West Columbia region of southeast B.C., which could see as much as 50 millimetres of rain by early Thursday. High streamflow advisories are in effect for Vancouver Island and the inner south coast, as well as the North and South Thompson and Upper Columbia regions of the Interior, while both the emergency management and forests ministries warn the rain could complicate wildfire recovery in regions such as the Shuswap. Following a season of severe drought and wildfire, rainfall on impacted areas can generate high surface water runoff and erosion due to a lack of vegetation, leading to a possibility of localized flooding and landslides, the provinces statement says. It also says widespread or severe impacts are not expected as part of the latest atmospheric river system, but officials are urging all residents, no matter where they live, to take steps to prepare for seasonal storms.

Progress toward an agreementinprinciple has made on operational issues on the new Columbia River Treaty, after the 19th round of negotiations concluded in Portland Oct. 1213. The latest round of talks including negotiators representing Canada and the United States made progress on operational and other issues, noted a press release Wednesday from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation. The teams will continue to address compensation and bilateral treatyecosystem provisions in the coming weeks, it noted. If the agreementinprinciple is confirmed, the details of the agreement will be revealed, with the Province launching a conversation with Columbia Basin residents in B.C. and First Nations to explain the deal, as well as seeking feedback on it. Although 60 years of Assured Flood Control is set to expire in 2024, Canada and the U.S. have been in talks to modernize the historical transboundary agreement since May 2018, covering a range of topics over the course of 19 rounds of meetings. The key areas of interest are flood risk management, hydroelectric power and ecosystems, while Canada has also raised the issues of increasing coordination of Libby Dam operations and increasing flexibility for Canadian operations. The treaty which governs the timing and volume of water that passes through the Mica, Duncan and Hugh Keenleyside dams to prevent damaging floods and enhances hydroelectric power generation means Canada operates with reserved space in its treaty reservoirs to reduce flood risk in the United States, but it also has ramifications in Nelson and area. People in the West Kootenay witness these operations as water levels fluctuate along Arrow Lakes and Duncan reservoirs and Kootenay Lake, said Kathy Eichenberger, executive director of the provincial Columbia River Treaty team and B.C.s lead on the Canadian Columbia River Treaty negotiation delegation. While there are impacts associated with those fluctuations, the treaty has enabled local GHGfree power generation along the Kootenay Canal and mitigated flooding on Kootenay Lake and below the confluence of the Columbia and Kootenay rivers in Castlegar, Genelle and Trail. The treaty also manages water level at certain times of the year to target fish populations in both countries for whitefish and rainbow trout Canada and salmon U.S.. The discussions between the two countries will modernize the treaty in a way that could lead to a shift in when and how much water is released from the Canadian reservoirs to address ecosystem and support objectives for Indigenous cultural values and socioeconomic interests, but still provide flood risk management and power generation. When the treaty expires in 2024, if a new one is not struck to replace it that could trigger a more impromptu called upon regime, which would require the U.S. to make effective use of their reservoirs to manage flood risk, drafting them more deeply and frequently, before calling upon Canada for additional storage to prevent damaging floods. This is not ideal for the U.S. and also impacts B.C., said Eichenberger. The Canadian and U.S. negotiating teams are discussing different concepts for potentially providing some form of assured flood risk management that meets the needs of both countries, she said. Coordinated operations for power generation are also part of these discussions. On the Canadian side more flexibility is being sought in the treaty for domestic operations to meet Basin interests in areas such as ecosystem enhancement, Indigenous cultural values and socioeconomic objectives. Return of the salmon First Nations are asking for the return of the salmon to the entire Columbia River system as part of the Columbia River Treaty negotiations, including the upper portion of the Arrow Lakes, in order to reclaim their culture. In a Zoom meeting on May 16, 2022 for the Columbia River Treaty negotiations, Chief Keith Crow of the Smelqmix, Lower Similkameen Indian Band, called for greater consideration of salmon in the river system. The Columbia River Treaty has been one of the biggest infringements within our territories, infringement of the treaty that was never negotiated with us, he said. The benefits that Canada and B.C. have received from the treaty have been tremendous, Crow said, but at the expense of the salmon and First Nations cultural traditions. He pointed to the Columbia River salmon restoration initiative which started three years ago as an example of reversing that trend. I think it is another major piece to bringing the salmon back up the Columbia all the way into the Upper Arrow, he said, which is a goal of the Smelqmix Nation. Jay Johnston of the Penticton Indian Band agreed. Although the Columbia River Treaty was formed on two points energy production and flood control it has never considered the effect on First Nations. It left out not only many voices in the Columbia Basin and around the river, but it also left out the environment and the ecosystems and the cultural values that are so critically important to all of us, he said.

More than 150,000 square kilometres of land were burned, affecting both First Nations and nonFirst Nations communities alike. The assemblys member First Nations declared a climate emergency in July 2019, in recognition of how climate change was negatively affecting their lands, waters, animals and peoples.

Interior this past summer B.C. Wildfire Services The Assembly of First Nations launched its new national climate strategy in Ottawa on Wednesday, calling on federal, provincial, and territorial governments to work with First Nations to implement their climate priorities. Interim National Chief Joanna Bernard said this years recordbreaking wildfire season is a reason why all leaders should be taking climate change seriously, especially in First Nations communities. More than 150,000 square kilometres of land were burned, affecting both First Nations and nonFirst Nations communities alike. This is only the beginning, said Bernard, adding more extreme weather can be expected including fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, species migration and coastal sea level rise, among other challenges. In the face of this, Indigenous Peoples have taken matters into their own hands to try to find solutions, Bernard said. The assemblys member First Nations declared a climate emergency in July 2019, in recognition of how climate change was negatively affecting their lands, waters, animals and peoples. The declaration called for the development of a First Nationsled climate strategy, which the AFN unveiled on Parliament Hill on Wednesday. The strategy aims to incorporate Indigenous knowledge systems, rights and selfdetermination in cooperation with other governments, and seeks urgent and transformative climate action that includes First Nations solutions. But the road to introducing mitigation measures, rather than just reacting to climate disasters as they happen, could be a difficult one. A report from the federal auditor general last year found the federal government still hasnt provided First Nations with the support they need to respond to emergencies such as wildfires and floods, despite similar warnings almost a decade ago. The report concluded that the government was too reactive, and was failing to proactively spend on infrastructure that could mitigate damage when floods, fires and landslides strike. The auditor pointed out that as of April 2022, 112 such projects did not have funding despite meeting the criteria for eligibility, and 74 of them had been in the departments backlog for more than five years. Until these projects are completed, First Nations communities are likely to continue to experience emergencies that could be averted by investing in the right infrastructure, the report read. Based on the First Nations Infrastructure Funds annual budget of 12 million, it would take the department an estimated 24 years to fund the projects, the report added. As a result, First Nations communities are likely to continue to experience emergencies that could be prevented or mitigated by building the infrastructure. At the time, Indigenous Services Canada said it was reviewing its emergency management plans and working with First Nations to identify infrastructure gaps and work toward closing that gap in the long term.

Rainfall warnings now cover Howe Sound and the Sea to Sky corridor up to Whistler, where ip to 110 millimetres is expected. The Sunshine Coast is expected to receive up to 80 millimetres, while large swaths of Vancouver Island excluding the north end and a stretch of coast from Nanaimo to Victoria are also under rainfall warning. B.C.s West Columbia region of the province, meanwhile, was issued a special weather statement Wednesday as between 30 and 50 millimetres of rain was expected to fall. The wet weather has appeared as a lowpressure system bringing large amount of moisture from the tropics, including remnants of Typhoon Bolaven. The BC River Forecast Centre has issued flood watches for the lower half of western Vancouver Island when rising river levels may approach or may exceed their banks, possibly flooding adjacent areas. The rest of the island, as well as the Sunshine Coast, Howe Sound, Upper Columbia and North and South Thompson regions remain under high streamflow advisories. Thats when river levels are rising or expected to rise rapidly, but that no major flooding is expected. Minor flooding in lowlying areas is possible, according to the centre.

Photo Dimitrios KambourisGetty Images for StripesAmyris Once a taboo subject, the rebranding of menopause has created a multibilliondollar business thanks to a flood of new products and celebrity endorsements. No woman on Earth needed Gwyneth Paltrow to tell her menopause could use a bit of rebranding, but since the 50yearold lifestyle guru made that prescient comment in 2018, its become clear the marketplace needed to hear it. Five years later, menopause is an industry unto itself, with Alist celebrities opening up, speaking out and cashing in with brand endorsements and products like Paltrows own cheekily named Madame Ovary, an oral supplement for common menopausal complaints. Indeed, the financial news website BNN Bloomberg reports the global market for menopausal products is growing rapidly, at a rate of more than five per cent, having already hit US15 billion in 2021. For a subject thats usually talked about sotto voce, if at all, this is a stunning social evolution or is it a revolution Either way, menopause is having a moment. Its about time, if you consider the statistics. Half the worlds population is female, and by 2025, more than one billion women will be heading into menopause. In Canada, a country of 38 million, about five million women are dealing with its multiple symptoms right now. And yet, a national study commissioned by the Menopause Foundation of Canada MFOC in 2022 aptly titled The Silence and the Stigma reported that one in two women feels unprepared for this stage of life and more than half believe menopause is still a taboo subject. In 2023, however, the change is bringing on, well, change. Leading the way are genX women who, unlike their mothers and older sisters, arent willing to suffer in silence or ignorance. Theres a lot of anger among women my age. We feel let down by the medical community, says Christina Valentine, 53, a mother of three who lives in downtown Toronto. Women arent accepting the lack of guidance and treatment for perimenopausal symptoms anymore and theyre acting on it. Remarkably, many women hit this life stage without a handle on the basics Perimenopause, which can take from two to 10 years, is the transition out of the reproductive years, when estrogen levels start plummeting menopause is defined by the absence of a period for 12 consecutive months. The whole process can begin in your 40s and end in your mid50s, and throughout, its possible to experience more than 30 symptoms, hot flashes being the best known, but not necessarily the worst. The Menopause Foundation of Canada study also found that 72 per cent of the 1,023 women aged 40 to 60 surveyed felt their doctors were unhelpful or only somewhat helpful and 38 per cent felt undertreated, so it stands to reason that this current, less hungup generation of women now entering perimenopause would seek advice elsewhere. Filling the void are functional doctors physicians who treat the body holistically, looking for the root cause of illness integrative doctors who pair conventional medicine with alternative therapies practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, naturopaths and dietitians. And then there are the products, many of them Alistbrandedandpromoted. Last October, 54yearold actress Naomi Watts launched Stripes, a wellness product line for women in perimenopause and menopause. American TV personality Stacy London, 53, who famously used to tell viewers What Not to Wear, cofounded State of Menopause and has branded herself as a menopause advocate and influencer. Author and comedian Jill Kargman hosted a menopause symposium for the Swell, an online membersonly community for those 40 and over. Kate Couric Media has invested in Kindra, which makes estrogenfree menopause essentials. Los Angelesbased tech company Embr Labs sells the Wave2, cooling wristband for hotflash relief U.S. 299. And while promoting her new book The Light We Carry 2022 Michelle Obama, 59, talked about her experience with menopause, describing her weight gain as a slow creep and telling People magazine how her workouts have changed. I am still physically active, and my goal now, instead of having Michelle Obama arms, I just want to keep moving. Theres no shortage of cleverly named natural products on the market Vag of Honor, meNOPause and Tranq Dranq but this is where the rebranding of menopause becomes tricky. The MFOCs president and cofounder, Janet Ko says its a positive thing when celebrities use their platforms to change the conversation on aging, but spreading misinformation is not. The challenge is the promotion of products that promise symptom relief but have no data to back their claims. She points to the North American Menopause Society guidelines that encourage women to seek only evidencebased solutions, grounded in science. So, with this recent upsurge in celebritygenerated exposure of menopause, you have to wonder if their voices diminish the stigma or simply add to the noise. Noise would no doubt be Dr. Jen Gunters reply. The outspoken Canadian obgyn and author of 2021s The Menopause Manifesto, says natural products are based on junk science. She has publicly sparred with Paltrow about the legitimacy of supplements sold on her online platform, goop.com, and what should or should not be inserted into the vagina. On Jensplaining, Gunters CBC docuseries, she says Theres no need the vagina is like a selfcleaning oven. But Gunter, while vociferous and committed, would need to quit her day job to fight in earnest the rising tide of alternative treatments. Celebrities are doing something right when they use their profiles to amplify the menopause narrative. No one prepares you, or tells you how long perimenopause lasts you dont even get a pamphlet from your doctor, says Shauna Levy, 54, founder of Canadian brand Madge and Mercer Modern Apothecary. Her brand of cannabisbased wellness products are for women over 40 who, she says, are comfortable with digital conversations and motivated to get past the taboo. Social media feels like a safe space to discuss topics like menopause that were previously not discussed. And not coincidentally, thats where celebrities with product lines are also active. But if you happen to be between the ages of 60 and 70, you might be asking yourself why you were left on a desert island of menopause with little to no help and certainly no hormone replacement therapy HRT. You can blame that on a 2002 study by the U.S.based Womens Health Initiative WHI, which erroneously linked hormone replacement therapy with breast cancer. By 2019, the studys findings were discredited, and HRT was no longer demonized. Now its regularly prescribed, but the WHI study held back progress in the field of womens health care by a decade, according to Dr. Wendy Wolfman, director of the Menopause Clinic at Torontos Mount Sinai Hospital and a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Toronto. After the WHI study hit, doctors didnt go into this area of medicine, says Wolfman. With HRT struck from the list of treatment options, there seemed to be little else your family doctor could do for you. Turning to Google, youd be encouraged to wear natural fibres and sleep in a cool room. As Wolfman sees it, until recently the study of menopause simply hasnt been respected in the medical community or at medical schools, in part due to societys lack of appreciation for aging women thus the dearth of training, research funding and general knowledge. Not even Oprah escaped the menopause knowledge gap. In 2019, while in her mid60s, she started having heart palpitations. She consulted five different doctors and went so far as to go on heart medication before her issue was correctly diagnosed perimenopause. We looked for the most dire explanation instead of the most likely, Oprah wrote in O magazine. The fact that heart palpitations are now recognized to be a symptom of menopause along with dry eyes, urinary tract infections and brain fog, to name just a few should indicate that menopause is finally getting some respect. Wolfman says that discoveries in the last years have helped. Now we know that every time a woman has a hot flash, its a huge vascular event, she says. That alone has lent medical validation to a symptom that, to most women, is just a pain in the ass. The workplace is where the rebranding of menopause could have serious economic benefits, given that five million women over 40 are part of Canadas 19millionperson labour force. As it stands, menopausal women in Canada are unsupported by their employers and often feel discriminated against based on age, which makes normalizing menopause a health equity issue, too. Maybe technology will help. Thats where investors are focusing their interests in the menopause marketplace. Alexis Ohanian, 39, who cofounded the social media platform Reddit and is married to tennis star Serena Williams, 41, raised seed funding for Elektra Health, a new womens health tech company working in partnership with worldrenowned physicians. Its mission is to smash the menopause taboo and bring it into the 21st century. The51, a womenfocused Canadian venture capital firm, is also setting its sights on digital platforms in the femtech space, including menopause. Cofounder Shelley Kuipers offers two examples of such startups Khyria, the first allinone health toolkit for women in midlife and menopause, and Herstasis Health, a platform for women in the menopausal transition to manage debilitating symptoms and improve their quality of life.|1

Je venais de me mettre au lit, lgrement ivre aprs avoir ft mon 31e anniversaire avec des copains, dans lappartement que joccupais au soussol de la maison de ma sur. Je vivais Sinzing, au sud de Bonn, en Allemagne, environ 500 m de la rivire Ahr. Il avait plu verse toute la semaine les autorits avaient mis un avertissement de crue et ordonn des vacuations, mais pas dans mon quartier. Par prcaution, javais empil des sacs de sable devant la porte qui donnait sur le jardin, et plac les vtements et les appareils lectroniques sur les tables et le canap, au cas o leau sinfiltrerait. Mes amis staient moqus de moi durant la soire, mais je ne voulais rien risquer. Je sombrais dans le sommeil quand jai t brusquement rveill par un bruit deau tumultueuse. En sortant du lit, jai atterri dans leau froide jusquaux genoux. Et elle montait vite Jai pens quune canalisation avait sans doute saut dans la salle de bain. Tremblant de froid, jai attrap mon tlphone et allum la lampe de poche. Il faisait nuit noire. Ce ntait pas la canalisation. Leau entrait par la porte du jardin. Les sacs de sable avaient vraisemblablement cd. Des tas dobjets flottaient dans le salon, des chaises, des tagres, une partie de ma batterie. Je commenais paniquer. La rivire Ahr, ce cours deau tranquille, au dbit habituellement si lent, tait violemment sortie de son lit. Il fallait que je sorte et vite Les effets de lalcool staient dissips la peur dgrise. Sous la pression de leau, la porte du jardin faisait un bruit de craquement dallumettes. a ne ressemblait rien que je connaissais, un mlange de crissements, de sifflements et de collisions. Implacable. Avec de leau qui me montait dsormais la taille, les pieds nus, le boxer coll la peau, jai avanc pniblement vers la seule sortie accessible la porte de lescalier qui conduisait au rezdechausse de la maison. Tout se brisait autour de moi les lampes volaient en clats, le frigo et les placards taient renverss. Jai pu tant bien que mal gagner la porte qui menait ltage, mais leau la tenait sous pression. Quand jarrivais lentrouvrir, la masse liquide la refermait aussitt. Jai cherch autour de moi un objet qui maurait permis de la caler et de la maintenir ouverte. Dans un coin, jai repr un balai, une pe trs lourde dniche dans une foire mdivale et un portemanteau. Je les ai mis en tas entre le cadre et la porte pour la maintenir suffisamment entrebille. Lpe ma sauv la mise. Je me suis gliss par les 30 cm douverture et jai pu enfin gagner lentre. La noirceur tait totale. Jai gravi lescalier jusquau deuxime o habitait ma sur. Mort dinquitude, jai tambourin sa porte et cri son nom avant de me rappeler quelle ne dormait pas la maison ce soirl. Revenu au rezdechausse mon autre sur y louait un bureau , je suis sorti. Immobile dans le noir, tremp et essouffl, je contemplais le paysage aquatique o flottaient des branches et des arbres. La rivire avait inond le quartier. Me calmant peu peu, jai pris conscience que, si javais tard de quelques minutes me rveiller, jy aurais laiss ma peau. On nous a assur que de tels vnements ne se produisent quune fois tous les 100 ans. Je lespre. Plus de 180 personnes sont mortes dans ces inondations, et certains villages de la rgion ont t balays.

Le hangar tait 40 minutes en voiture de chez moi. la priphrie de Suffolk, dans le sudouest de la Virginie, il y avait tout lespace arien et les terres non habites dont on pouvait rver. Je suis mont bord de lavion avec 15 autres parachutistes pour un premier saut 13h30. Le temps tait superbe. Javais repass avec mon instructrice toutes les consignes de scurit un rituel reprendre avant chaque saut, quelle que soit lexprience du parachutiste. Il faut notamment pointer depuis la porte de lavion la zone de saut lendroit o vous prvoyez atterrir 4100 m, pour diriger le saut. Nous avons saut, moi dabord, puis mon instructrice, plongeant en chute libre quelque 200 km lheure, soit 300 m en 5 secondes. Cest une sensation exaltante et terrifiante la fois, avec le monde qui souvre sous nos yeux. Jtais port par le vent et, environ 1200 m du sol, jai dploy lextracteur un petit parachute utilis pour lextraction de la voile principale. Une fois libr, le grand parachute sest gonfl dair, et je disposais denviron une minute pour profiter de la quitude en me balanant doucement vers lherbe du sol. Je me sentais invincible. Nous sommes vite repartis pour un deuxime saut. Le groupe de parachutistes discutait et plaisantait dans lavion. Ctait gnial. Jai rpt la mme scne avec linstructrice, puis nous avons saut. Aprs 30 secondes, environ 1680 m, nous nous sommes loigns lun de lautre pour que nos parachutes puissent se dployer sans obstacle. Jai jet un coup dil sur laltimtre et me je suis rendu compte que jtais plus bas que je ne croyais. Le sol arrivait une vitesse vertigineuse Je savais quil fallait librer lextracteur environ 1200 m, comme la dernire fois, mais, pris au dpourvu et press, je nai pas pris le temps de stabiliser ma position. Quand jai tir lextracteur, au lieu quil se relche dans la colonne dair pour se gonfler, il sest enroul autour de ma jambe droite en la tirant vers le haut je ressemblais une ballerine. Le parachute principal restait dans son sac. Il suffit que je me dgage, aije song calmement. Jai perdu 7 secondes essayer de me dmler, en vain. Jaurais mieux fait de dployer immdiatement le parachute de rserve. Je distinguais de plus en plus nettement le sol et me prparais au choc. tonnamment, je ne mattendais pas un impact catastrophique. Je men tirerais avec une fracture de la jambe, tout au plus. Jai toujours t optimiste. Soudain, le parachute de rserve automatique qui se dploie quand le principal ne fonctionne pas sest ouvert. Jai regagn une certaine matrise avant de viser les herbes en esprant que latterrissage y serait plus doux. Mon soulagement a t de courte dure. Quelques secondes plus tard, le parachute principal sortait enfin de son sac et se gonflait. Entres en concurrence, les deux voiles se sont mises tirer chacune de son ct, ce qui a violemment prcipit ma chute au sol, non loin de la zone de saut. En mcrasant, jai senti une brlure vive sur tout le corps. Jai essay de me relever cest ce quil faut faire quand on natterrit pas sur ses pieds pour montrer que a allait. Jen tais incapable. Mes membres infrieurs taient figs. Le visage dans lherbe, les bras en croix, jai hurl laide Au secours Entre chaque appel, je priais haute voix Piti, mon Dieu. Faites que je ne sois pas paralys Je suis rest ainsi 5 minutes, le visage enfoui dans lherbe. Puis les gens du club de parachutisme sont arrivs. Ils mont entour, dsireux daider, mais ne pouvaient rien faire. Me bouger aurait t trop risqu, ce que je nai pas compris tout de suite. Je les ai donc accabls dinjures et dappels laide mesure que ltat de choc se dissipait et que la douleur sinstallait. Lambulance est arrive une demiheure plus tard la douleur tait telle quil a t impossible de me mettre sur une civire pour le transport. Je hurlais. Puis jai entendu lhlicoptre. son arrive, lquipe mdicale de lambulance arienne ma administr de la ktamine qui ma envoy au pays des rves, puis jai t transport au centre de trauma le plus proche. Les blessures se sont rvles assez graves une cheville clate, une fracture du tibia et une lsion de la colonne vertbrale responsable dune fuite de liquide rachidien. Personne ne pouvait assurer que je marcherais de nouveau un jour, mais jtais dtermin et, en fvrier 2022, trois mois aprs laccident, je faisais mes premiers pas. Jai entrepris un programme de physiothrapie soutenu qui se poursuit encore aujourdhui. En novembre 2022, alors que jtais incapable de soulever les jambes aprs laccident, je grimpais jusquau camp de base de lEverest. Je prvois reprendre le saut en parachute mais je nai encore rien dit mes parents. Cette histoire datterrissage haut risque, o un pilote davion sest vanoui, laissant au passager lobligation de diriger lavion, est toute aussi terrifiante Kagan McLeod Jai survcu une tornade de neige , coince dans ma voiture Shannon St. Onge, 38 ans La tempte devait dbuter en soire, le lundi 31 janvier 2022. Je travaillais la maison, mais javais prvu me rendre au bureau luniversit canadienne des Premires Nations, Regina, pour signer le chque dune bourse durgence accorde un tudiant. tant directrice des finances, je souhaitais lui faire parvenir cet argent le plus vite possible, tempte ou pas. Je ntais pas inquite. Javais amplement le temps de faire lallerretour. Jai roul 30 minutes sur la Transcanadienne vers lest. Ds mon arrive, mon collgue sest point pour signer lui aussi le chque et il a aussitt quitt luniversit. Jallais partir mon tour quand jai remarqu le sac dordinateur quil avait oubli dans mon bureau. Zut, je suis dj la maison, atil soupir quand je lai appel. Je te lapporte si tu veux. Il tait un peu pass 16h30. La neige ntait pas prvue avant le dbut de la soire, mais par mesure de prudence, jai prfr prendre les petites routes plutt que lautoroute qui risquait de se transformer rapidement en patinoire. Avant darriver chez lui, jai fait un plein et achet deux pizzas en prvision du souper, comme je my tais engage auprs de ma fille de 15 ans et de mon fils de 10 ans. Le trajet jusque chez mon collgue a pris une quinzaine de minutes. Je lui ai laiss le sac et jai repris la route aussitt. Il a commenc neiger et les flocons tombaient, abondants. En quelques minutes, tout tait blanc. Jtais au milieu dune tornade de neige, ou ce que les mtorologues la tl appellent un hurleur de la Saskatchewan, une tempte qui sabat vite avec des vents si violents quelle hurle. Ctait terrifiant Engage sur une route de gravier, jtais force de ralentir. Jai baiss la vitre pour suivre le bord de la chausse afin de ne pas dvier. En ralit, je ne savais pas de quel ct je roulais. Craignant de me retrouver dans le champ, le foss ou quoi encore, jai fini par marrter, sans couper le contact pour rester au chaud, et appeler les secours. On ma recommand de ne pas bouger et dattendre le lendemain personne ne viendrait me chercher avant le matin, au plus tt. Les quelques secondes qui ont suivi ont t les pires de mon existence. Il tait exclu de sortir dans cet univers de blanc o tout est invisible, avec des vents puissants et une temprature frlant les 10C. Et puis je ne savais pas o jtais et javais peur que les automobilistes, faute de me voir, ne foncent dans ma voiture. Ou que la neige ne bouche le pot dchappement et que je meure intoxique par le monoxyde de carbone. Et si la tempte durait plus longtemps que prvu et quon me retrouvait trop tard Respire, inutile de paniquer, me suisje dit. Mes enfants Ils passeraient une premire nuit la maison sans moi. Jai appel pour les prvenir, me forant garder un ton calme. Je ne leur ai pas dit que jtais terrifie. Il tait prs de 18h et il faisait nuit. Comment les secours arriveraientils trouver mon VUS Ford Edge noir dans toute cette neige Verraientils seulement une ombre Un camion est pass, vitant de peu la voiture. Je lavais chapp belle. Jai dabord eu peur, puis je me suis dit que jtais sauve. Jai embray pour le suivre, dsespre, rou lant lentement, nayant aucune ide o il allait. Quand le camion a bifurqu un carrefour, je suis reste dsempare. Je vais la plage, atil cri par la vitre baisse, les paroles emportes par le vent. Ma maison ne se trouvait pas dans la direction de la plage, mais je ne savais pas du tout o jtais. Jai arrt la voi ture pour envoyer un texto au collgue qui javais rapport le sac. Jai plaisant sur cette bonne action se terminant par une catastrophe. Il a eu une ide. Dtermine ta position sur Google Maps et envoiemoi le rsultat. Je me suis excute et quelques minutes plus tard, il me renvoyait une capture dcran de la vue satellite du lieu o je me trouvais. Il sagissait vraisemblablement de Bouvier Lane, une petite route qui reliait deux fermes. Il tait 18h30. Jai post cette information sur mon compte Facebook en priant que quelquun connaisse au moins une personne qui pourrait venir mon secours. Il ny avait plus qu attendre sagement dans la voiture en tchant de rester au chaud. Jtais contente davoir fait le plein. Javais pris les bonnes dcisions et, quoi quil arrive, je ne pouvais pas men vouloir. Mais mme si on savait o je me trouvais, comment avancer dans cette neige tourbillonnante souffle par des vents hurlants Les ractions ma publication sur Facebook ont t rapides. Des gens connaissaient une famille qui vivait par l Jai reu le message dune personne qui allait me mettre en relation avec elle. 20h, mon tlphone a sonn. Ctait le fils du fermier propritaire de la terre qui longeait la route o je mtais arrte. Son pre viendrait me chercher Quarantecinq minutes plus tard, jai vu un homme assez grand vtu dun impermable jaune avanant dans ma direction dans le noir, une lampe torche la main. Quel soulagement Andr Bouvier avait parcouru 500 m dans le blizzard pour venir mon secours, luttant pas pas contre le vent et la neige, se protgeant les yeux de la morsure des flocons de sa main recouverte dune mitaine. Vous prenez le volant aije demand dune voix chevrotante travers la vitre. Je suis trop nerveuse. Malgr sa dmarche puissante, le voyant maintenant de prs, jai compris quil sagissait dun vieil homme. Non, atil rpondu dune voix calme. Vous me suivrez en voiture. Tout ira bien. Il a commenc avancer pniblement dans la neige, sr de sa direction. Je roulais lentement derrire lui, les mains cramponnes au volant, sentant les battements de mon cur sapaiser. Nous sommes arrivs chez lui en quelques minutes. En sortant de la voiture, jai clat en sanglots, la peur cdant au soulagement et la gratitude. Pendant que sa femme me servait une boisson chaude et une compote de pommes, Andr je venais dapprendre quil avait 80 ans est ressorti dans la tempte. Il avait vu deux autres voitures bloques et allait les aider leur tour un pre et ses deux enfants et un couple avec leur fille. Nous avons pass la nuit raconter des histoires, les enfants ont mang les pizzas que javais achetes et nous avons dormi dans la maison, qui sur les canaps, qui dans les fauteuils bascule. 5h30, le lendemain, Andr avait dgag la neige devant chez lui pour nous permettre de reprendre la route et de rentrer la maison. Jtais finalement 5 minutes en voiture, mais je ne men tais pas rendu compte la veille. Mme si je lavais su, jaurais risqu ma vie en poursuivant ma route. Cette exprience a transform ma vision de lexistence. Elle ma appris accueillir plus calmement les dfis et les retournements de situation. Elle a aussi renforc ce sentiment quil faut, quand cest possible, tendre la main vers les autres et les aider, les amis comme les trangers. Je suis toujours en relation avec Andr.

Rainfall warnings across Vancouver Island and the inner South Coast have lifted for the most part, but flood watches posted by the B.C. River Forecast Centre across western Vancouver Island and for the Englishman River near Parksville warn of levels seen only once every 10 years on some waterways. High streamflow advisories and the risk of local flooding cover the rest of Vancouver Island, most of the inner south coast north of Vancouver, and the Interior regions of the Upper Columbia, North and South Thompson. Environment Canada says the mild, subtropical surge of moisture that created B.C.s latest atmospheric river Tuesday and Wednesday has mostly passed, with rain still falling throughout Thursday. According to the agency, the storm had dumped 233 millimetres of rain at the Kennedy Lake forestry station east of Ucluelet by late Wednesday and at least 172 millimetres at the Tofino airport, while parts of Metro Vancouver received up to 100 millimetres. The accumulations mark the heaviest downpours across the South Coast in almost a year. Environment Canada records show the greatest deluge before that was during the atmospheric river in November 2021, which caused devastating flooding, washouts, and landslides from Metro Vancouver to the southern Interior. Drought levels drop in some areas Meanwhile, the rain has also helped add some muchneeded moisture to some areas of the province. The West Vancouver Island Basin has now dropped to Drought Level 1 the second lowest on the sixlevel scale where adverse impacts are rare. The east island basin is now at Drought Level 2, which the province says means adverse impacts are unlikely. The Lower Mainland, meanwhile, has also dropped to Drought Level 2. While there have been some improvements in parts of B.C., the northeast continues to see dry conditions, with a number of areas still classified as Drought Level 4 or 5, meaning adverse impacts are likely or almost certain. Those levels are the highest on the scale.|1

The Fed has raised interest rates to a 22year high as it looks to tame high inflation, which remains stuck above its longterm target of two percent. Nevertheless, price increases have slowed sharply since last year, while the economy has remained resilient, raising hopes of a socalled soft landing, in which inflation is quashed through rate hikes without causing a damaging recession.

The study region includes widespread mud volcanoes and other mud upwellings.|view of Hydraotes Chaos white outline, including the location of the proposed mud lake black arrow PSI A landmark discovery by a collaborative team led by the Planetary Science Institutes Alexis Rodriguez has unveiled evidence of sedimentary plains created by aquifer drainage within Martian collapse formations termed chaotic terrains. Our research focuses on a sedimentary unit within Hydraotes Chaos, which we interpret to be the remnants of a mud lake formed by discharges from gascharged mudstone stratigraphy dating back to nearly 4 billion years ago, a time when the surface of Mars was likely habitable. These sediments might harbor evidence of life from that or subsequent periods. It is important to remember that the subsurface of Mars might have included habitability lasting the duration of lifes history on Earth, said Rodriguez, lead author of the paper Exploring the evidence of middle Amazonian aquifer sedimentary outburst residues in a Martian chaotic terrain that appears in Nature Scientific Reports. PSI scientists Bryan Travis, Jeffrey S. Kargel and Daniel C. Berman are coauthors on the paper. Scientists from NASA Ames Research Center, the University of Arizona, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, and the University of Florida are also coauthors on the paper. Figurea Map of Hydraotes Chaos showing how the interpreted mud volcanoes orange dots and diapirs white dots are widespread. Both feature types result from sedimentary volcanism instead of magma upwells and eruptions, wet sediments, and salts reach and breach the surface, forming mounds and flows. Interestingly, these mounds only occur over the chaotic terrain floor materials and not on the mesas redshaded areas they embay. This suggests a material composition link rather than a genesis by regional extensional forces generated by magmatic rises. Figure b shows a possible mud volcano.

The extensive study of Martian aquifer drainage has revealed enormous flood channels that stretch thousands of kilometers into the planets northern lowlands. The prodigious erosion caused by these channels, combined with the subsurface sediments released from the aquifers, blankets extensive portions of the northern lowlands. This complex landscape presents a formidable challenge for the investigation of the nature of the Martian aquifers. Venturing into the northern plains for sampling could prove precarious, as distinguishing between materials sourced from the aquifers and those eroded and transported during channel formation could become an intricate task. The plains, situated within Hydraotes Chaos, offer a unique glimpse into ancient aquifer materials. These plains, which we think formed from mud extruding into a basin directly above their source aquifer, provide a more targeted exploration opportunity, Rodriguez said. Unlike vast flood channels with their complex erosion patterns, this finding simplifies the examination of Martian aquifers, reducing the risk of overland sedimentary acquisition, and opens a new window into Mars geological past. Our numerical models reveal a fascinating story. The lakes source aquifer likely originated from ice, water and mineral separation within the mudstone, forming vast waterfilled chambers, several kilometers wide and hundreds of meters deep. This process was likely triggered by intrusive igneous activity. Moreover, the observed segmented subsidence across the chaotic terrain suggests an interconnected network of chambers, depicting stable waterfilled giant caverns, some reaching kilometers in widths and lengths, way larger than any known Earth counterparts, coauthor Travis said. Initially biomolecules could have been dispersed throughout the volume of large groundwater filled cavities. As the water was released to the surface and ponded, the water went away leaving behind layers of sediments and potentially high concentrations of biomolecules, Rodriguez said. Therefore, the residue of this ancient mud lake could provide unprecedented access to aquifer materials enriched in biomolecules that have remained hidden within Mars subsurface for most of its existence. NASA Ames is considering the plains as a possible landing site for a mission to search for evidence of biomarkers, specifically lipids. These biomolecules are extremely resistant and could have endured billions of years on Mars, coauthor Mary Beth Wilhelm, an astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center, said. The study region includes widespread mud volcanoes and other mud upwellings. The mud could provide new windows into subsurface environments, which once were moist and maybe even habitable. Signatures of life and its habitats could include freezedried remnants of microbes in the upwelled mud, and the mud would contain minerals indicative of the temperature and composition of subsurface water. A small rover, if directed to that potential landing site, could detect these clues in the erupted mud., coauthor Kargel said. Our crater counts indicate that the plains are relatively recent, returning an age of 1 billion years. This age is good news for our search for life. This age is way younger than the ages of most aquifer releases on Mars, dating back to approximately 3.4 billion years ago. So, the materials spent a huge amount of time in the subsurface, coauthor Berman said. lobate margin forming part of a constant elevation contact, which we interpret as the lakes inundation periphery.

A publicsafety warning about high water continues on the Puntledge River, which flows through Courtenay, after B.C. Hydro released water from the Comox dam. The warning will be in effect until Tuesday, said Hydro spokesperson Stephen Watson. The release of water is being done to lower the level of the reservoir behind the dam and keep it from overflowing due to recent rainy conditions, he said. When we increase the water flows from our spillway gates, we issue an advisory. The Comox dam is one of four systems that Hydro operates on the Island to produce power, Watson said, with the other power stations on the Campbell River system, the Ash River system in the Alberni Valley and the Jordan River system. He said the recent rain has been good for waterways like Campbell River. Watson said that system received the equivalent of an Olympicsized swimming pool every five seconds during the height of the stormy weather. So its good for power generation, its good for salmon. The weather office says the storm had dumped 233 millimetres of rain at the Kennedy Lake forestry station east of Ucluelet by late Wednesday and at least 172 millimetres at the Tofino airport, while parts of Metro Vancouver received up to 100 millimetres. The accumulations mark the heaviest downpours across the south coast in almost a year. Environment Canada records show the greatest deluge before that was during the atmospheric river in November 2021 that caused devastating flooding, washouts and landslides. jbelltimescolonist.com To comment on this article, write a letter to the editor letterstimescolonist.com|1

The U.K.s weather forecaster, the Met Office, issued a rare red alert the highest level of weather warning for parts of Scotland, predicting exceptional rainfall Thursday and Friday that is expected to cause extensive flooding and danger to life from fastflowing or deep flood water. The last red alert in the U.K. was issued in 2020. Forecasters say the storm, named Babet by U.K. officials, could bring more than a months worth of rain in the worstaffected regions in Scotland. Babet already brought floods and swollen rivers that swamped several towns and villages in Ireland, with some areas remaining under water and without power Thursday. Soldiers helped with evacuation measures in the town of Midleton in County Cork, where more than 100 properties were flooded. Cork County Council said mor In the town of Brechin, near Scotlands eastern coast, officials told residents of about 400 houses to evacuate to local rest centers. Schools, recreation centers and vaccination hubs in the area were closed and will remain shut on Friday. In Denmark, residents scrambled to place sandbags along exposed areas. In Assens on the central island of Funen, emergency services deployed huge rubber tubes in the harbour to counter rising water levels, broadcaster TV2 reported. Southern Denmark police urged people along the east coast to leave exposed areas if the weather predictions remain, saying cottages, harbours and other places could be flooded. TV2 reported that the region would likely see the worst flooding in 110 years, and the Danish Meteorological Institute said waves could reach 4 meters 13 feet along eastfacing coasts. The southeastern Danish town of Koege wrote on its Facebook page that emergency workers were busy filling sandbags and urged citizens to avoid unnecessary baths, dishes, laundry and other waterintensive activities, saying the municipalitys treatment plant was at risk of being overloaded. Police in the area warned that roads may be blocked, urged people to secure valuables and advised against sleeping on their boats in the harbours, saying that if something happens, emergency services cannot get to them, police spokesperson Brian BangRasmussen said. Copenhagens airport and the Danish national rail company warned of cancellations and delays Friday because of bad weather. Several ferry lines between Danish islands were suspended, as were ferries to Rostock in northern Germany and to Oslo. Swedish meteorologists also issued a warning for the south coast from Friday evening and Saturday. They said that the water level in southern parts of Sweden may reach its highest level since the 1990s. In Germany, authorities warned of high water in bays in SchleswigHolstein, south of the Denmark border, until Saturday. Authorities also warned of high water in the next two days on the Baltic Sea coast of SchleswigHolstein, Germanys northernmost state, with water levels of up to 2 meters 6.6 feet above average possible in the inlet where the city of Flensburg is located. Some ferries to the North Sea islands of Foehr and Amrum were delayed or cancelled, German news agency dpa reported. Norwegian meteorologists said a strong lowpressure area over Great Britain combined with high pressure over northern Scandinavia was creating strong winds, with very strong gusts expected to hit southern Norway from the east. Parts of southern Europe were also affected by heavy rains. Stormy weather battered much of Spain, leading to ferry cancellations from the southwestern ports of Algeciras and Tarifa to Tangier in Morocco and the closure of public parks in several cities, including Madrid. The stormy weather, expected to worsen Friday in several regions, comes after the hottest and driest first two weeks of October on record. Spain had been experiencing a severe drought for nearly two years. Liam Quaide, a local politician in Cork, Ireland, said authorities need to focus more resources on preparing for climate change. The scenes of devastation in Midleton are an ominous sign of what is ahead of us as a nation if we dont double down on climate mitigation and adaptation, he said.|1

One of the topics was a Disaster Financial Assistance DFA claim from 2022 for damage along Border Road. There was a considerable amount of damage to the southern slope of the Border Road thats east of Gretna, explained Wiebe. The damage to this road was approved as a flood claim, and so at the last meeting, council passed the resolution granting the tender for road damages to Diamond Construction and Gravel. This work involves removing some of the dirt and replacing it with the rubble. The rubble will protect the road from high flood waters, and the nice part of this is the dirt will be deposited at the shooting range, and will be used to enhance their berms. But just a reminder, because of the existing international agreements, the level of the road will not be raised. The conversation also included an invitation for all area residents to join the Municipality, in conjunction with the Town of Altona, at its annual Remembrance Day service, Saturday, November 11th at Gretna School beginning at 1030am. We believe its important to take a moment to recognize those who gave their lives, and the veterans who fought to preserve our way of life. You can listen to todays Reeve on the Radio, below.

It comes after a summer of historic natural disasters and flash flooding in July which claimed four lives in West Hants. Leader Zach Churchill introduced proposed legislation to expand cell coverage in every region of the province and improve emergency preparedness. Weve seen this year, more than ever, how important it is to be prepared for emergency situations, said Churchill. Hard, but important, lessons must be learned from the many natural disasters our province has experienced. The bills provide practical solutions to many of the biggest challenges that were identified during some of the darkest days our province has ever experienced. It is being called The Highway Cellular Coverage Act and would mirror a similar initiative done in British Columbia to ensure there is cell coverage on all highways in the province. Many pockets of Nova Scotia lack cell service and it drops in and out depending on where you are driving.

Three deaths in the U.K. were blamed on the bad weather. The winds are expected to hit hardest in the eastern part of Denmarks Jutland peninsula and the Danish islands in the Baltic Sea. But the northern part of the British Isles, southern Sweden and Norway, and northern Germany are also in the path of the storm, named Babet by U.K.s weather forecaster, the Met Office. Eastern Scotland continued to bear the brunt of the stormy weather. On Friday, the Met Office issued a new red warning, its highest, for parts of the region through Saturday. This is not usual autumn weather, said Andy Page, the Mets chief meteorologist. This is an exceptional event, and we are likely to continue to see significant impacts with the potential for further flooding and damage to properties, said Andy Page, the Mets chief meteorologist. On Friday, police reported that a man in his 60s died after getting caught in fastflowing flood water in the central England county of Shropshire. In Scotland, a 57yearold woman died Thursday after being swept into a river in the region of Angus, where hundreds of homes were also evacuated. Also on Thursday, a 56yearold man died after his van hit a falling tree in the same area. Though forecasters said the worst of the heavy rain in Scotland had passed, they warned that conditions will remain difficult, with river levels still on the rise and flood defences breached. Some parts of the town of Brechin are only accessible by boat after its flood defences were overwhelmed by the heavy rainfall, raising concerns about further loss of life. I cannot stress how dangerous conditions are in Brechin in particular, said Scotlands first minister, Humza Yousaf. Wind gusts in excess of 100 kmh were likely on Friday. Several major road sections and rail routes were closed in Scotland, while air passengers were facing flight cancellations. The storm has already brought more than a months worth of rain in the worstaffected regions in Scotland and was pummelling many parts of England on Friday. At Leeds Bradford Airport, a flight arriving from the Greek island of Corfu skidded off the runway while landing in windy conditions. There were no reported injuries and ensuing arrivals were diverted to other airports. We are working with the airline, relevant operations teams and emergency authorities to address this situation and remove passengers from the aircraft safely, a spokesperson for the airport said. In northeastern England, a lighthouse at the mouth of the River Tyne lost its distinctive red and white dome. Port of Tyne officials said it was not yet safe to assess the damage to the South Shields lighthouse while weather conditions remained dangerous. The swirling weather system was also hitting other parts of Northern Europe, particularly Denmark. The Danish Meteorological Institute wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it expects water levels to exceed the 100year event in several places. Police in southern Denmark the Danish region expected to be the worst hit said a number of sections of road in lowlying areas were flooded and some trees had fallen. Police said a dike was breached and urged people to immediately leave Sandersvig Strand on the Jutland peninsula. Danish meteorologists issued their highest warning for very dangerous weather and said levels of some inland waters were expected to rise up to 240 centimetres above normal. In neighbouring Sweden, meteorologists warned of the risk of extensive flooding which may cause limited access on roads and railways along the southern coasts of the Scandinavian country. Water levels were expected to begin dropping again on Saturday morning, Swedish meteorologists said. A bridge near Norways secondlargest city was protectively closed, the Bergens Tidende newspaper said. Ferries across the region were cancelled and air traffic was hampered, with delays and a few cancellations. The Swedish Transportation Authority suspended service of several train and bus lines in southern Sweden, because of the weather, prompting Skanetrafiken, the operator of the local transit system, to recommend avoiding travel on public transport. Some regional bus routes will be cancelled and there is a risk that both regional and replacement buses in service may also be cancelled at short notice, Skanetrafiken said on its website. In Germany, some streets and squares were flooded in the cities of Flensburg, Kiel and Wismar on the Baltic coast. Fallen trees caused some disruption, including a railway line. Ferry operator Scandlines suspended services on its RoedbyPuttgarden and GedserRostock routes between Denmark and Germany. On Germanys North Sea coast, the high winds had the opposite effect to the flooding on the Baltic coast, pushing the water further out and leading to very low water levels. Ferries to some North Sea islands were cancelled.|1

A muchloved Vancouver restaurant has been fined 7,000 after being caught serving a minor in a Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch sting. Popular West Broadway sushi restaurant The Excellent Eatery was visited at random by two branch agents March 26. With them was a minor agent under 19. The minor entered the Eatery first and was seated at a table. The inspectors followed and were given their choice of tables, selecting the one next to the minor. The inspectors had a clear line of sight of the minor agent at all times. A server gave the minor cutlery and took their order for a beer. When the beer was delivered, the minor left followed by the inspectors, case adjudicator Dianne Flood said in the newly release Sept. 18 decision. At no time was the minor agent asked to produce identification, nor could she have provided any as her own identification was being held by the inspectors, Flood said. An inspector then informed a staff member of the alleged contravention and took a photo of the beer. The licensee does not dispute that the server did not ask for identification and sold liquor to a minor but claims a defence of due diligence, Flood said. Flood said the Eaterys policy is to request identification from anyone ordering liquor who appears to be under 30. She said the restaurant comanagers hold staff meetings about every three or four months and topics always include liquor service. The server was told not to come in for two weeks after the incident. The branch noted the restaurant had training deficiencies, including a lack of a written policy manual to be provided to staff, a written checklist and tests. The lack of an incident log was also called a failure. The eatery told Flood training includes information about the harms to minors of the consumption of liquor, and that new servers are given very clear instructions to identify anyone who looks to be under 30. It said a manual, while not provided to staff, is used as guide in the training. The eatery said they ensure new servers have read and understood the Serving it Right guide and that the guide is pinned on the operations Slack for easy access. Flood found The Excellent Eatery had gaps in its policy system and that an outdated policy manual was not given to employees. She said testing of employees would assist in employee training. I have identified a number of areas where I find the licensees training and systems in relation to prohibiting the sale of liquor to minors are not adequate, Flood said. On that basis, I conclude the licensee has failed to establish the defence of due diligence at the time of the contravention of the sale of liquor to a minor and find imposition of a penalty is warranted. Flood said the licensee has a long history without branch or police warnings.|1

Ontarians once again experienced a summer of severe storms and floods that damaged or destroyed homes, vehicles and businesses, said Amanda Dean, interim vicepresident, Ontario, Insurance Bureau of Canada IBC. While much of Southern Ontario was affected, the Ottawa region was hardest hit by these summer storms, with intense flash flooding, torrential downpours and violent wind gusts. Our member insurers have been on the ground since day one and continue to work with the large number of policyholders whose property was damaged by these events, she continued. Flooding and severe storms can be costly, stressful and difficult for people who have been affected, added Dean. As rebuilding and recovery continue, those who have been impacted can continue to work with their insurance representative. Residents who want to check that they have the coverage they need should contact their insurance representative to ensure they have the right coverage to protect their property or business from the impacts of the frequent and severe storms we are experiencing. Of the storms that hit Southern Ontario over the summer, some resulted in more insured losses than others. Specifically, the highest costing storms, according to CatIQ, included the Southern Ontario torrential downpours on August 3, 2023, which resulted in over 100 million in damages, and the Ottawa flash flooding on August 10, 2023, which resulted in over 110 million in damages. With the increase in unpredictable weather patterns, CatIQ reminds to be aware of shifting weather conditions and to prepare accordingly to prevent potential damages as best as possible.|1

The swirling weather system was also hitting other parts of northern Europe, particularly Denmark. The Danish Meteorological Institute wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it expects water levels to exceed the 100year event in several places. Police in southern Denmark the Danish region expected to be the worst hit said a number of sections of road in lowlying areas were flooded and some trees had fallen. Police said a dike was breached and urged people to immediately leave Sandersvig Strand on the Jutland peninsula. Danish meteorologists issued their highest warning for very dangerous weather and said levels of some inland waters were expected to rise up to 240 centimetres nearly eight feet above normal. In neighbouring Sweden, meteorologists warned of the risk of extensive flooding which may cause limited access on roads and railways along the southern coasts of the Scandinavian country. Water levels were expected to begin dropping again on Saturday morning, Swedish meteorologists said. A bridge near Norways secondlargest city was protectively closed, the Bergens Tidende newspaper said. Ferries across the region were cancelled and air traffic was hampered, with delays and a few cancellations. The Swedish Transportation Authority suspended service of several train and bus lines in southern Sweden, because of the weather, prompting Skanetrafiken, the operator of the local transit system, to recommend avoiding travel on public transport. Some regional bus routes will be cancelled and there is a risk that both regional and replacement buses in service may also be cancelled at short notice, Skanetrafiken said on its website. In Germany, some streets and squares were flooded in the cities of Flensburg, Kiel and Wismar on the Baltic coast. Fallen trees caused some disruption, including a railway line. Ferry operator Scandlines suspended services on its RoedbyPuttgarden and GedserRostock routes between Denmark and Germany. On Germanys North Sea coast, the high winds had the opposite effect to the flooding on the Baltic coast, pushing the water further out and leading to very low water levels. Ferries to some North Sea islands were cancelled. Pylas reported from London. Associated Press writer Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.|1

In fall, larger and widely distributed rainfall systems are more common and have the potential to increase flood risk from rivers and streams, said CVC in a press release. The Greater Toronto Area can be subject to remnant hurricane systems. In most cases hurricanes have weakened substantially and are downgraded by the time they reach the Credit River watershed, however, they can bring heavy and significant rainfall amounts. The local conservation authority notes that hurricane season occurs from June 1 to November 30 in the North Atlantic, but often the most powerful hurricanes happen during late summer and early fall months. While less common, CVC says its possible for the watershed to receive rainfall from Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones systems. Residents living next to watercourses are reminded to secure loose objects this fall, such as lawn furniture and watercrafts that are in the floodplain in preparation for the spring snow melt and rains that can increase the risk of flooding.

Norma had weakened and was downgraded to Category 1 on the hurricane wind scale. It was located 25 miles west of Cabo San Lucas storm with winds of 85 mph 140 kmh and expected to make landfall on Saturday, according to the U.S. AP PhotoFernando Llano Original Publication Date October 20, 2023 916 PM CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico AP Hurricane Norma came ashore near the resorts of Los Cabos at the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula on Saturday afternoon, and hours later Hurricane Tammy made landfall on the Caribbean island of Barbuda. Both storms were Category 1 hurricanes when they hit. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Norma, once a Category 4 hurricane, moved ashore with winds of 80 mph 130 kph near el Pozo de Cota, westnorthwest of Cabo San Lucas. Norma later weakened to a tropical storm with 70 mph 110 kph winds as it crossed the Baja California Peninsula and by late Saturday it was nearing the Sea of Cortez, also known as the Gulf of California. Businesses in Cabo San Lucas had nailed plywood over their windows, and government personnel hung banners warning people not to try to cross gullies and stream beds after Norma regained strength and again became a major storm Friday. Norma was centered about 45 miles 70 kilometers northnortheast of Cabo San Lucas late Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving northnortheast at 6 mph 9 kph, but was expected to take a harder turn toward the east Sunday. President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador said via the platform X that there had so been no reported loss of life from the storm. Hurricane Norma already passed Los Cabos and there are only torrential rains in La Paz, but without loss of life. In Cabo San Lucas, curious tourists began to pick their way along debrisstrewn beaches after the storm passed. The effects of the storm were still being felt after night fell, and authorities urged people to stay at home. There were still families in shelters in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, though officials did not say how many. Around 200 people were in shelters in La Paz. Its languid pace raised the possibility of severe flooding. Norma was expected to dump six to 12 inches of rain, with a maximum of 18 inches in places across southern Baja California and much of Sinaloa state. John Cangialosi, a senior specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said the area is vulnerable to rain because it is a dry region generally. Six to 12 inches of rain is what is generally forecast, but there could be pockets of up to 18 inches of rain and we do think that will be the most significant impact that could result in flash and urban flooding and mudslides, he said. Baja California Sur Gov. Victor Castro said via the platform X that because its moving slowly, greater damages are anticipated. But little damage was initially reported. Some trees and power poles were down, but there were no reports of injuries. Police in San Jose del Cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early Saturday. Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. Some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations. By late morning, the areas streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about threequarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. The local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. Airports were closed. San Jose del Cabo airport director Francisco Villaseor said he expected flights to resume by midday Sunday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tammy came ashore Saturday night with 85 mph 140 kph winds. The hurricane was moving northnorthwest at 10 mph 17 kph and by late Saturday was centered 15 miles 25 kilometers northnorthwest of Barbuda. Hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelmy. The warning was lifted for Antigua. The hurricane center said that heavy rainfall and flooding are likely over much of the Lesser Antilles. Tammy hit two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe swept by Antigua and Barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. The slowmoving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation, where the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Philippes recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. This means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said in a nationwide broadcast Friday. He urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. Government offices, banks and most nonretail businesses closed early on Friday to allow staff to prepare. Residents rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout St Johns and near popular shopping centers and supermarkets. Local disaster management officials announced plans to open about 40 shelters in communities throughout the country.

Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. Some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations. By late morning, the areas streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about threequarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. The local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. Airports were closed. San Jose del Cabo airport director Francisco Villaseor said he expected flights to resume by midday Sunday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tammy came ashore Saturday night with 85 mph 140 kph winds. The hurricane was moving northnorthwest at 10 mph 17 kph and by late Saturday was centered 15 miles 25 kilometers northnorthwest of Barbuda. Hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelmy. The warning was lifted for Antigua. The hurricane center said that heavy rainfall and flooding are likely over much of the Lesser Antilles. Tammy hit two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe swept by Antigua and Barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. The slowmoving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation, where the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Philippes recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. This means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said in a nationwide broadcast Friday. He urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. Government offices, banks and most nonretail businesses closed early on Friday to allow staff to prepare. Residents rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout St Johns and near popular shopping centers and supermarkets. Local disaster management officials announced plans to open about 40 shelters in communities throughout the country.

APs earlier story follows below. CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico AP Residents of Mexicos Los Cabos resorts rushed to prepare as Hurricane Norma headed toward the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula for an expected landfall Saturday, while in the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy threatened to batter the islands of the Lesser Antilles. Businesses in Cabo San Lucas nailed up sheets of plywood over their windows, and government personnel hung up banners warning people not to try to cross gullies and stream beds after Norma regained strength and once again became a major storm Friday. By early Saturday, Norma had weakened and was downgraded to Category 1 on the hurricane wind scale. It was located just offshore 25 miles west of Cabo San Lucas storm with winds of 85 mph 140 kmh and moving north at 8 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The hurricane was expected to continue on that path through the evening before turning to the northeast and slowing down through Monday. The forecast track would take a weakened Norma toward the mainland of Mexicos western Pacific coast as a tropical storm. Its languid pace raised the possibility of severe flooding. Norma was expected to dump six to 12 inches of rain with a maximum of 18 inches in places across southern Baja California and much of Sinaloa state. According to the state civil protection agency, shelters in Baja California Sur housed some 1,500 people by Saturday morning. The Los Cabos Civil Defense agency urged residents to stay indoors all day as winds and rain increased. Emergency workers rushed around the area evacuating people from lowlying areas and moving them to shelters. Police in San Jose del Cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early Saturday. Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were already isolated by rising water. Some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. By late morning, the areas streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said hurricane conditions were already occurring over southern parts of the peninsula. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about threequarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, Baja California Sur state tourism secretary Maribel Collins said. There was no way out anyway Airports were closed Saturday, according to the local civil defense office. The local hotel association estimated there were about 40,000 tourists still in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. At the marina in Cabo San Lucas, Jos Cesea was hauling out of the water the boat he usually uses to ferry tourists around on tours. With the port closed to navigation and a hurricane coming, he said it wasnt worth risking his craft. Homero Blanco, the state commander of the National Guard, said beaches at the resort had been ordered closed and Guard troops were sent to clear people from the seashore. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations, and municipal officials said as many as 39 emergency shelters could be opened, if needed. In the Atlantic, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Tammy had winds of 85 mph 140 kph, and hurricane warnings were issued for the islands of Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Tammy was moving northwest at 8 mph 13 kmh. In the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy was about 25 miles 40 kilometers northnortheast of Guadeloupe and 50 miles 80 kilometers southeast of the Caribbean island of Antigua. Tammy was expected to remain at hurricane strength and even strengthen slightly as it moved toward the Lesser Antilles through Saturday passing by Guadeloupe, Antigua and Barbuda. Both Martinique and Guadeloupe are French overseas departments. The hurricane center said in a report that heavy rainfall and flooding are likely over much of the Lesser Antilles. Two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe rolled through Antigua and Barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness, residents of the islands braced for Tammys arrival. The slowmoving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation where the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 and recent wind damage and flooding from Philippe are still fresh memories.

The council has put together disaster kits that will be distributed to 73 museums and archives throughout the province over the next couple of weeks. Sharon Murray, the councils archives advisor, said the kits were created with water in mind, whether thats from rain storms, leaky pipes or firefighters hosing down the building in case of a fire. These are kits that contain supplies that will help heritage organizations protect their collections and to salvage them, so to rescue them, get them out of harms way, Murray told CBC Radios Information Morning Halifax. Which, as Im sure everyone can imagine, is a big concern for folks because the reason that archives and museums have the things they have is because theyre oneofakind and they cant be replaced. Disaster kit totes include personal protective equipment, a small toolbox, a tarp, towels, large plastic bags, plastic sheeting and plastic storage boxes, among other items. Erin MacInnisCBC The kits include personal protective equipment, waterproof lighting, a small toolbox, a tarp, various forms of tape, towels, absorbent material, large plastic bags, plastic sheeting and plastic storage boxes, among other items for patching holes, cleaning up and storing artifacts safely. Murray said the idea for the disaster kits came after posttropical storm Fiona hit the province last September, bringing strong winds and heavy rain that cut power and washed out roads for days. She said the council had implemented disaster supply depots in Yarmouth, Halifax and Sydney about 10 years ago, but during Fiona, archive members couldnt access them due to the road closures and travel restrictions. That was a problem, Murray said, so the council secured a grant from the Department of Communities, Culture, Tourism to create the individual kits that can be kept at archives around the province. Information Morning NS 818 Council of Nova Scotia Archives preparing disaster kits amid fires, floods Featured Video In the age of increasingly violent storms, fires, and floods, the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is working to protect some of the provinces most vulnerable artifacts and documents from natural disasters. CBCs Erin MacInnis spoke to the archives advisor at the council, Sharon Murray. She said these severe weather events werent top of mind during archival training 10 to 20 years ago, but how to prevent damage is becoming necessary for archives and museums amid the climate crisis. Murray said that became more apparent in the spring when wildfires raged throughout the province, and in the early summer when historical flooding swamped the central region. Im sure theres lots thats been lost to all of the natural disasters weve had before. Fires, floods, you name it. Its a lot of responsibility in some ways, being a steward of cultural heritage, but its incredibly meaningful work, Murray said. And I think for a lot of our members, they do feel that they are doing a service to their community by preserving and promoting the heritage of their people in that region and at times like this, its really scary. Volunteers with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives were busy putting the disaster kits together last week. Erin MacInnisCBC Angie MacIsaac, the executive director of the Port Hastings Historical Society Museum and Archives, can attest to that. She said heavy rainfall last fall caused a leak in their facility, but there were no materials on site to fix it. We went scrambling, trying to save the collection. It wasnt much of a leak, but it still made it difficult, MacIsaac said. If it would have happened on a weekend we do operate in a small community so things may not have been open on a Sunday to be able to go get the supplies we needed. She said luckily none of their archival items or artifacts were damaged, but a disaster kit could have taken away some of the stress at the time. Most of the buildings that house archives are older facilities and hardertomaintain facilities. We work on a limited budget. Our finances are always to the penny and tight, so the kit makes everything there at our fingertips ready to go in case something happens, she said. Murray said thats one of the goals of these kits to take some worry away from smaller rural institutions that hold valuable documents and artifacts. Part of what both archives and museums offer to people whether they live here or are visiting is an opportunity to connect with history in a really tangible way, and that tangibility of it is what is at the biggest risk here, she said. And so being able to see artifacts on display or to actually flip through a book that has your grandmothers name in it that kind of experience cannot be replicated digitally, and that is what were at risk losing.

Police in southern Denmark, the Danish region expected to be the most affected, said that a number of road sections in lowlying areas were flooded and some trees had fallen. Police said the dam had been breached and urged people to leave Saundersveig Strand immediately on the Jutland Peninsula. Danish meteorologists issued their highest warning of extremely dangerous weather and said some inland water levels were expected to rise to nearly eight feet above normal. In neighboring Sweden, meteorologists warned of the risk of widespread flooding that could lead to limited access to roads and railways along the southern coast of the Scandinavian country. Swedish meteorologists said water levels were expected to start falling again on Saturday morning. Bergens Tidende newspaper said that a bridge near the second largest city in Norway was closed for preventive reasons. Ferries were canceled across the region and air traffic was disrupted, with a few delays and cancellations. The Swedish Transport Authority has suspended service on several train and bus lines in southern Sweden due to the weather, prompting Skanetrafiken, the operator of the local transport system, to recommend avoiding travel by public transport. Some regional bus routes will be cancelled, and there is a risk that existing regional and alternative buses may be canceled in service in a short time, Skanetrafiken said on its website. In Germany, some streets and squares were flooded in the cities of Flensburg, Kiel and Wismar on the Baltic coast. Fallen trees caused some disruption, including to the railway line. Ferry operator Scandlines has suspended services on the RoedbyPuttgarden and GedserRostock routes between Denmark and Germany. On Germanys North Sea coast, strong winds had the opposite effect of flooding on the Baltic Sea coast, pushing water farther and causing water levels to fall significantly. Ferries to some North Sea islands have been cancelled.

Parodying 37 of Shakespeares plays in a comically shortened format, Timothy Murphy, Marc Beaudette, and AJ Brisson will take on 150 characters from the playwrights most famous comedies, histories, and tragedies. If you love Shakespeare, youll love the show if you hate Shakespeare, youll love the show, Beaudette told SooToday. It really is for everybody and its a laugh a minute for two hours. All the histories are done like a sporting event, they lump all of his comedies together in five minutes, and they do one of his obscure plays as a cooking show, he adds. Directed by Sandra Forsell, the play was last performed by Sault Theatre Workshop in 2006 according to Beaudette, but he says some of the content has since changed to keep up with changing times. They keep revising it to keep it more topical, so a lot has been added to it since the 2006 show, he explains. Some of the jokes and references are updated to the current times as well. No night is the same as the next either, he adds. Theres a lot of improvisation and audience participation in the show. There will be different things each night based on audience reaction and things that we as actors will find on different nights as well. The Algoma Repertory Theatre team is hoping the Shakespearean show can carry over the dinner theatre momentum from their successful production of Tony n Tinas Wedding last April. With hundreds of shows combined between the experienced cast of three, Beaudette says this production is unlike any other theyve ever rehearsed for. Its the funniest show Ive ever rehearsed, he says. The process has been so much fun, and the three of us are working so well together. Each one of us brings a different skillset to the table, and weve gelled together to make this a really tight show. While evoking laughter is his top priority, Beaudette says he also hopes the play serves as an opportunity to help keep Shakespeares works alive. This is definitely a great springboard into Shakespeare or getting back into Shakespeare, he says. For people who have been interested in his shows in the past, their memories will be triggered by this. There are moments where the language can get a little complex, he adds. Several times the actors kind of just look at the audience and go I dont know what it means either. So, they do make light of it. Performances run from Nov. 811 at the Quattro Hotel and Conference Centre. Dinner will be family style with roast chicken, Italian seasoned potatoes, penne, and homemade red sauce, along with mixed greens, green beans and fresh bread. Its such a great venue the ballroom is such a great space, Beaudette says. Were going to be limiting tickets to 200 a night, but there really isnt a bad seat in the house. Its such a good setup for dinner theatre. Doors open at 6 p.m., dinner will be served at 630 p.m., and the show begins at 8 p.m. Tickets are available by calling Marc Beaudette at 705 9439519 or by clicking here.

The first has to do with the little blue civic address signs at the end of rural driveways. Our Public Works Department is advising us that a number of civic address signs are either missing, bent or knocked over, making them very difficult to read, explained Wiebe. He is asking property owners to make sure their signs are clearly visible. This civic address number, or yard number, are really quite critical. These numbers inform police, ambulances and the fire department where an emergency is located. Additionally, Wiebe says the Public Works Department is asking those whove placed bales near municipal roadways to clean them up by the end of October. Meantime, damage sustained to the Border Road, located east of Gretna along the CanadaU.S. boundary, in Spring 2022 is finally getting repaired. Wiebe says the Municipalitys flood claim has finally been processed. And so, at our last meeting, Council passed a resolution granting the tender for road damages to Diamond Construction and Gravel. This work involved removing some of the dirt and replacing it with rubble. The rubble will protect the road from high flood waters. He noted however, that due to existing international agreements, the height of the road will not be altered.

Since Thursday, at least four people have died in the storm, named Babet by the U.K. Meteorological Office. The latest victim was a 33yearold woman who was killed when a tree fell on her car on the Baltic Sea island of Fehmarn on Friday afternoon, German news agency dpa reported. Three stormrelated deaths were reported in England and Scotland on Thursday and Friday.

In Flensburg, a German city just south of the border with Denmark, water levels rose more than 2 meters to the highest level recorded in a century, dpa said. Power was cut to flooded parts of the city for safety reasons. Ferry lines and railway service were temporarily suspended in affected areas in Germany, Denmark and southern Sweden. Copenhagens airport cancelled 142 flights due to the storm on Friday but resumed operations on Saturday morning. People were evacuated from homes and campgrounds in severely hit areas in Denmark and dozens of people were without power. The municipality of Haderslev in southern Denmark decided to evacuate the entire coastline. The situation on the coast is now so serious that it is too dangerous to stay there. All affected areas are evacuated and the emergency response is pulling out its crews, the municipality said in a Facebook post late Friday. It wasnt immediately clear how many people were affected. The Danish Meteorological Institute warned of strong winds and elevated water levels throughout the weekend. In Scotland, as much as 4 inches 100 mm of rain was forecast Saturday, and several towns remained under a red weather alert, the highest level, which means there is a danger to life. Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said parts of eastern and northern Scotland had already had a month and a halfs worth of rain during the storm, with more downpours coming that could push those areas close towards two months of rain in the span of three days. In the worsthit town of Brechin, residents of more than 300 homes were told to leave before the River South Esk breached its banks Friday, surging almost 4 meters 13 feet above its usual level and sending water pouring into the streets.

With the week ahead remaining rather unsettled, therell be further rain at times, he said, adding the risk of flooding remained high in parts of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire. Experts say climate change makes extreme flooding events more likely because a warming atmosphere increases the chance of intense rainfall. However, many factors contribute to flooding and it takes time for scientists to calculate how much impact climate change has had on particular weather events if any. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

Darren TaylorSooToday Sault Ste. Marie Tim Hortons franchisees, along with ARCH and Twinkie Foundation representatives, gathered at the McNabb and Pine Street Tim Hortons location where Tim Hortons presented over 32,000 to each of those organizations in support of their community efforts, funds raised through Smile Cookie sales, Oct. 28, 2021. Darren TaylorSooToday Advertisement One of the Saults largest nonprofits is organizing a public information session in an effort to remind the community of the services they offer for young families. Created in 2017, the Twinkie Foundation helps support local families with travel costs when their child requires medical care out of town. The funding helps families with additional costs that a ministryprovided travel grant wouldnt cover, including hotel accommodations, rental car and transit rates, and food. Since cofounding the organization, Karen Lefave and her husband Greg have assisted hundreds of families with sick children receive the financial assistance they need to make those difficult trips including 80 families in 2023 alone. Although theyre nearing their seventh anniversary as a registered charity, Lefave says there are many eligible families who still arent aware they exist. What we need is exposure, she told SooToday. We need families to know were here. We cant help them if they have no idea. I had two applications in the last two weeks, and both of them brought up the fact that they found out about our foundation either after the fact, or they found out about us through hospitals in Toronto or London but not locally. Lefave said one local family mentioned theyve been going to Sick Kids every two months for the last three years and werent aware of the Twinkie Foundation and the travel costs they cover. Comments like those can admittedly be disappointing to hear according to the cofounder, which is why shes looking forward to hosting an information session over Zoom for community organizations and agencies who work with kids daily. I want to tell as many people as possible who work with these families, both in the medical environment and people who see these cases come up, she explains. I just want to tell people this is who we are, this is who we help, and this is how we can help. That way, they can have as much information at their fingertips as they need. I will answer any questions that anyone has on the Zoom call, she adds. Im happy so far with the requests Ive gotten so far which is great. The more exposure on this info session we can get, the better. Im excited. Among the invited organizations includes Sault Area Hospital medical staff, THRIVE Child Development Centre, Group Health Centre, local Ornge services, Midwives of Algoma, Algoma Nurse PractitionerLed Clinic, Child Care Algoma, and several daycare services. I want the Twinkie Foundation to be something families think of automatically when their child gets sick, Lefave says. The last thing they should have to do is worry about going to Toronto because they cant afford it. Our main goal is to decrease as much stress as possible for families, she adds. We obviously cant make a child better or cure a sickness or disease, but we can help in other areas like financial assistance and guidance. We want everyone to know were here. While the Twinkie Foundation receives zero government funding, the nonprofit has been given many generous donations from a number of community groups and fundraisers since their inception. From vendor shows and hockey tournaments to comedy nights and the Smile Cookie campaign, Lefave says she couldnt be more appreciative for the Saults generosity in helping families receive the care their sick children so desperately need. Weve been wildly fortunate in this city for the donations we get, she says. We dont have a lot of exposure for the families that need us, but on the flip side, we do have a lot of people who donate. To apply for Twinkie Foundation funding, the sick child must be under the age of 18 be a resident of Sault Ste. Marie or live within 100 kilometres of town have a confirmed appointment at any medical facility 200 kilometres or further outside of Sault Ste. Marie For more information on how to get involved with the Twinkie Foundation, or to join the upcoming Zoom information session on Oct. 30 at noon, contact can be made by visiting the foundations website or social media page.|1

Nadine Alaloul, 26, says the situation in Gaza is dire and fears have also made their way to the West Bank. She says her dad and aunt fled their homes and is calling on politicians to demand a ceasefire. I dont know how much longer people in Gaza can hold on.|For the second week in a row, thousands of Londoners gathered on Sunday to demand government action in calling for a ceasefire as the IsraelHamas war enters its third week, chanting in unity as they marched through the downtown. The protest started with several community leaders speaking at Victoria Park about the worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza describing dwindling medical supplies and a lack of food, water, and electricity. They also spoke about the panic and fear their families living in the West Bank are feeling as tensions rise there and people consider fleeing their homes. With all the unrest happening you really dont know whats going to happen, Nadine Alaloul said, explaining that her father and aunt have evacuated their homes on the West Bank. Its very unpredictable right now so its just safer to leave even though we obviously dont want to. The Gaza Health Ministry says more than 4,300 people have been killed in Gaza. More than 1,400 in Israel have been killed, most of them slain in the surprise Oct. 7 attacks, according to the Israeli government. Nadine Alaloul, 26, says the situation in Gaza is dire and fears have also made their way to the West Bank. She says her dad and aunt fled their homes and is calling on politicians to demand a ceasefire. Isha BhargavaCBC Alaloul said she is very disappointed in government responses to the situation and believes politicians need to do more in calling for a ceasefire and increase the number of humanitarian aid trucks getting to Gaza. Its absolute heartbreak and shock, but its not even the shock that this is happening, but its more of the shock that we have governments debating what to do, she said. Twenty trucks carrying humanitarian aid were allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt on Saturday. The Canadian government announced later the same day, it would provide an additional 50 million for humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip as the regions border crossing with Egypt opened to let in a trickle of desperately needed aid. Londoner Nidal Abdalhaq who grew up in Jerusalem says watching buildings in Gaza turned to rubble has been very heartbreaking and hes never seen anything like this before. Isha BhargavaCBC International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen issued a statement from Cairo, Egypt, saying the federal government will ensure none of the money goes to Hamas. Hussen said the money will be used to provide the Palestinian population with food, water, medical assistance, protection services and other lifesaving aid. Twenty trucks is not enough to address the needs of desperate civilians who are struggling to get by, said Londoner Nidal Abdalhaq. Seeing buildings in Gaza turned to rubble has felt unreal and like the scene of a movie, he added. This is not the first time Ive seen something like that but its never happened to this extent that Im witnessing right now. Its been chaos everywhere and nowhere is safe, Abdalhaq said. Abdalhaq said hes thankful he is still able to connect with most of his family living in the West Bank, but keeping in touch with loved ones in Gaza has been a challenge since theres little to no network and many people are using car batteries to charge their phones. I dont know how much longer people in Gaza can hold on. Theyre very strong and patient with whats going on and thats why were marching here today because I want people to hear our voices and know that were not okay with this violence.|1

The Met Office is promising a drier and brighter day for many. But the travel disruption caused by the storm is set to continue through Sunday, with warnings not to travel on parts of the rail network. Simon Calder, Travel Correspondent of The Independent, has been checking the transport system on Sunday morning. Network Rail says the routes linking Edinburgh with Inverness and Aberdeen will be badly affected by severe weather all day, and that speed restrictions will apply on other lines. Major disruption to services in Scotland is expected until the end of the day, is the message. Anyone who makes it to Edinburgh may find their problems are only just be beginning, because the East Coast main line is heavily disrupted. Saturday was chaotic on the line linking Scotland, northeast England and Yorkshire to London, with Kings Cross station closed for a time because of the sheer number of passengers trying to make journeys, and many of those people will be back to try again on Sunday only to find delays and cancellations, including a number caused by staff shortage. LNER tickets for today are valid until Friday. The main line from Sheffield to London is closed north of Derby because of flooding, and the lines from Derby to both Matlock and Sheffield. Elsewhere, Skegness is cut off from Nottingham and Norwich is cut off from London due to flooding on the line north from Ipswich. In Wales, Transport for Wales is warning of flooding on some lines, and is urging passengers not to travel south from Llandudno on the line to Snowdonia. On the seas the overnight Northland ferry from Aberdeen, Orkney and Shetland, which normally sails at 5pm, left 11 hours late and wont reach Lerwick until 6pm tonight. This evenings overnight sailing will be at least four hours late. in the Western Isles, the main problem is residual disruption from Friday and Saturday on Caledonian MacBrayne ferries. The company had planned an additional pair of sailings between Ullapool and Stornaway to clear traffic from previous cancellations, but this has now been cancelled due to a technical issue with the vessels sewage system. And the first sailing from Tarbert to Uig is cancelled. On the Channel, DFDS Ferries says all services are currently operating with delays due to strong winds in the Channel. The advice is to checkin as normal and you will be put on the first available sailing to Calais and Dunkirk. Leeds Bradford airport was closed for 24 hours on Friday and Saturday, and knockon disruption is continuing. Some planes overnight arrived at Leeds Bradford many hours late, and consequently there are further delays for departures today.

However the public has been warned that dangers from floodwater and damaged infrastructure remains. Sepas flood duty manager, Vincent Fitzsimons, said While the weather is an improving picture today, and rivers will continue to fall throughout the day, its important to remember that there are still hazards caused by floodwaters and its important not to put yourself at risk. Sepa are removing the majority of local flood warnings but regional flood alerts remain in force in areas like Tayside and Aberdeenshire. This reflects not only the dangers which still exist from standing floodwater, and fastflowing river water, but also that there are important recovery activities under way.|1

Gavin Nicol said the full extent of the damage in the Angus town of Brechin had yet to be established. The red warnings covering parts of Scotland have expired and conditions improved throughout Sunday. But a yellow ice warning for most of the country will be in place from 2100 to 0900 on Monday. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency Sepa said river levels across the north and north east remain high. A number of flood alerts have been issued but no rain is forecast for the next two days. And the A90 remains closed between Dundee and Stonehaven as experts inspect the road and bridge structures. A boy rests after emergency services assisted in the evacuation of a family from their home in Brechin on Friday Mr Nicol, who represents the Brechin and Edzell Ward, said parts of the town were still coated in contaminated sludge and silt. Asked when some people would be get back into their homes he told BBC Scotlands The Sunday Show It will be an extensive period. It will take a fair bit of sorting. These houses wont be ready by Christmas. Mr Nicol admitted the towns flood defences, which were upgraded in 2016, now need to be reviewed. He said The weather conditions are changing. Probably the goalposts have shifted now and they are going to have to look at new measures now and ways of doing it. The councillor said one possible option would be to plant more trees in the surrounding glens to restrict the flow of water. Mr Nicol added I am hoping the first minister will take pity on us and give us more money for Angus Council. Humza Yousaf is expected to visit the area on Monday to thank those involved in the flood response, including the emergency services and local volunteers. Two people died during the storm in Scotland and searches continue for a man reported missing to police on Friday, who is said to have been trapped in a vehicle in floodwater in Marykirk, Aberdeenshire. Story continues A car pictured on a bridge washed away near Dundee following Saturdays torrential rain A 57yearold woman died on Thursday after being swept into the Water of Lee, Glen Esk, and a 56yearold man was killed the same day after a falling tree hit a van near Forfar in Angus. Two people have also died in England, including a woman in her 80s in Chesterfield. Sepas flood duty manager Vincent Fitzsimons said The last week has been very challenging for people in Scottish communities, who have experienced another severe weather event. While the weather is an improving picture today, and rivers will continue to fall throughout the day, its important to remember that there are still hazards caused by flood waters and its important not to put yourself at risk. Energy firm SSEN said it restored power to 37,000 customers during the storm and fixed more than 450 faults across its network. It also confirmed households impacted by power cuts for more than 12 hours were entitled to 30 per person, for every day without power, to cover food and drink costs. SSEN urged customers to keep hold of receipts and claim costs back via its website. ScotRail said most services would be back to normal on Monday but some may start later in the morning in Fife. It added the Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh line will remain closed until at least Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Aberdeen Elgin route has reopened but the Aberdeen Dundee line remains closed. Customers are advised to check the ScotRail website before they travel. Scott Prentice, interim commercial director, said Unfortunately, we are still seeing some extremely challenging conditions on the rail network in Fife, the northeast, and the far north caused by the most rainfall experienced in Scotland since 1891. Our first priority is always the safety of customers and staff, and we wont run services until we are absolutely sure the lines are safe. Meanwhile, the operators of a North Sea drilling platform said it was secure despite losing four of its eights anchors during Storm Babet. Elsewhere, residents in the Aberdeen suburb of Peterculter were advised to leave their homes on Saturday in case of flooding. Serious damage has been caused in the Marykirk area, where a man was reported missing The Scottish governments resilience room met on Saturday to discuss the exceptional levels of rain that had fallen in parts of the country. The meeting, chaired by Justice Secretary Angela Constance, heard several areas were still dealing with severe flooding while some rivers remain at hazardous levels. Ms Constance said The storm has caused significant damage and, while flooding is still occurring, it is not expected to be as serious as over the last 24 hours. The impact, however, will be felt in communities for some time to come. She added that while many local authorities were still responding to the immediate impacts of the storm, thoughts were now turning to recovery. Ms Constance said Over the coming days and weeks, we will stay in close contact with local authorities to support the people and businesses affected.|1

Once a Category 4 hurricane, Norma came ashore Saturday as a Category 1 near the Pacific resort of Los Cabos at the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula. Tens of thousands were left without power. Normas gusts continued to cause damage as the storm moved northeast, crossing the Gulf of California toward the Mexico mainlands Sinaloa state, where schools were ordered closed Monday. Shelters were set up in Sinaloa and neighboring Sonora with capacity for nearly 13,000 people. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Sunday evening that Norma was about 120 miles 195 kilometers west of Culiacan, and about 65 miles 105 kilometers southsouthwest of Los Mochis. The storm regained a bit of strength as it moved northeastward across the Gulf of California with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 kph. Up to 18 inches 45 centimeters of rain could fall in some areas Monday, forecasters warned. These rains will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, the hurricane center said. In Los Cabos, fallen trees blocked some streets. But with no major damage, tourists began to emerge, some with the intention of leaving. They told us that the air terminal is now open and we want to return to San Diego, since the danger of the hurricane is over, said Henry Brown, a U.S. citizen waiting for a cab to take him and his wife to the San Jose del Cabo airport, which resumed operations in the morning. Brown acknowledged the wind was very strong Saturday but said they had no major problems because they stayed sheltered in the hotel. Others, like American Noah Johnson and his family, went for a walk to see how the beach had been left but were willing to continue their vacation, which ends on Tuesday, even though they regretted that many restaurants and other businesses remained closed. But to the north, there was no flying out of La Paz, the capital of Baja California Sur. It was hit with so much rain that the airport remained closed. Streams of water with logs, dirt and garbage crossed many of the highways so many entrances to the city were blocked. Elements of the security forces made rounds looking for people in need of help. In the citys bay, 400 people remained on a ferry that was transporting them from Sinaloa to Baja California Sur and was caught in the storm. They have not been able to get off the ferry because the port is still closed, said Santiago Jorge Morgado, commander of the Fourth Naval Region in La Paz. Baja California Sur authorities had not reported any fatalities, but said an Argentine tourist was injured. The main damage was to boats, three of which sank, Morgado said. The Mexican navy said it has 5.000 marines deployed to attend the states affected by Norma with ships, helicopters, trucks, food, water and first aid. Meanwhile, Antigua and Barbuda escaped with no reported injuries from Hurricane Tammy. A late and sudden shift spared the Antigua from a direct hit, but left the sister island in line for the systems full force during the late night hours Saturday. To the best of my knowledge, there has been no significant damage. At least we got some rain. It may not be a lot but much needed rain, a relieved Prime Minister Gaston Browne told The Associated Press. The hurricane made landfall on the 62squaremile Barbuda at approximately 915 p.m. Saturday, bringing heavy rain and winds as high as 92 mph. The storm knocked down some power lines, triggered an island wideblackout and caused minor damage to a few homes. However, no major infrastructural damage was reported. At least two families had to be evacuated by a local rescue team, Barbudas disaster coordinator, Tessa Webber, told AP. Tammy hit as the memory and trauma of Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 storm that razed the island in 2017, remained foremost in the minds of Barbudans. Antigua fared much better, with only a few broken branches and broken utility lines reported. Acting electricity manager for the countrys lone utility company, Lyndon Francis, could not yet put a timeline on restoration work in Barbuda and the few communities in Antigua that lost power during the storm. Crews were out assessing the damage, he said. Tropical Storm Otis formed over the Pacific far from Mexicos coast, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was about 500 miles 800 km southsoutheast of Acapulco. It was moving at 5 mph 7 kph northnorthwest, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph 65 kph. The NHC estimated that Otis would remain a tropical storm while moving closer to Mexico, before weakening to a tropical depression by Friday. But it said heavy rainfall may impact coastal areas of southern Mexico from Oaxaca to Guerrero later this week.

Hours later, Hurricane Tammy made landfall on the Caribbean island of Barbuda. The storms were each Category 1 hurricanes when they hit. There was a threat of heavy rainfall and flash flooding as Norma moved into mainland Mexico early Sunday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami reported at 3 a.m. ET. Norma was centred about 145 miles 235 kilometres west of Culiacan, Mexico, and about 105 miles 165 kilometres southsouthwest of Los Mochis, Mexico, moving northnortheast at 7 mph 11 kph with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph 95 kmh. The Mexican government extended a tropical storm warning along the coast northward to Huatabampito, the centre said. Tammy came ashore Saturday night with 85 mph 140 kph winds. In an update at 5 a.m. ET Sunday, the hurricane centre said the storm was centred about 70 miles 115 kilometres northnorthwest of Barbuda and about 55 miles 90 kilometres eastnortheast of Anguilla. Tammy was moving northnorthwest around 10 mph 17 kmh and hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelmy, while a tropical storm warning was discontinued for Saba and St. Eustatius. Norma, once a Category 4 hurricane, moved ashore with winds of 80 mph 130 kph near el Pozo de Cota, westnorthwest of Cabo San Lucas. The system later weakened to a tropical storm with 70 mph 110 kph winds as it crossed the Baja California Peninsula, the centre said. Businesses in Cabo San Lucas had nailed plywood over their windows, and government personnel hung banners warning people not to try to cross gullies and stream beds after Norma regained strength and again became a major storm Friday. President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador said via X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that there had been no reported loss of life from the storm by Saturday night. In Cabo San Lucas, curious tourists began to pick their way along debrisstrewn beaches after the storm passed. Authorities urged people to stay at home Saturday night. There were still families in shelters in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, though officials did not say how many. Around 200 people were in shelters in La Paz. Its languid pace raised the possibility of severe flooding. Norma was expected to dump six to 12 inches of rain, with a maximum of 18 inches in places across southern Baja California and much of Sinaloa state. John Cangialosi, a senior specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said the area is vulnerable to rain because it is a dry region generally. Six to 12 inches of rain is what is generally forecast, but there could be pockets of up to 18 inches of rain and we do think that will be the most significant impact that could result in flash and urban flooding and mudslides, he said. Baja California Sur Gov. Victor Castro said on X that because its moving slowly, greater damages are anticipated. But little damage was initially reported. Some trees and power poles were down, but there were no reports of injuries. Police in San Jose del Cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early Saturday. Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. Some neighbourhoods lost electricity and internet service. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort area to help with storm preparations. By late morning, the areas streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about threequarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. The local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. Airports were closed but San Jose del Cabo airport director Francisco Villaseor said he expected flights to resume by midday Sunday. Tammy hit two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe swept by Antigua and Barbuda dumping 6 to 8 inches 15 to 20 centimetres of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. The slowmoving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches 30.4 centimetres over a twin island nation, where the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Philippes recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. This means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said in a nationwide broadcast Friday. He urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. Government offices, banks and most nonretail businesses closed early on Friday to allow staff to prepare. Residents rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout St Johns and near popular shopping centres and supermarkets. Local disaster management officials announced plans to open about 40 shelters in communities throughout the country.

The stop was part of a whirlwind tour of cities and communities to reach out to residents, local governments and businesses to gauge what is important to their communities and see progress in ontheground projects, said Eby. While the province is working with city staff and councillors on several fronts, including housing and rural healthcare, Eby explained water is a priority after the drought and fires of the past summer. They are looking at not just flood mitigation, but water use by residents, agriculture and industry. The visit began with a walk along the dike wall between the Rotary spray park and the Kettle River and a demonstration of one of the emergency pumping, which Ben Stevens, the citys project manager for flood mitigation said was pumping about 680 litres a second. The purpose of it is to pump water out of the downtown storm sewer system in the event of another flooding event. Even at its maximum capacity, it can handle the water levels seen during the 2018 flood, plus another 10 per cent calculated for climate change, said Stevens. Afterward, Eby and an entourage of security, staff and city councillors walked to BoundarySimilkameen MLA Roly Russells office, stopping at some local businesses to meet owners and chat with residents. At Russells office, a roundtable of stakeholders, which included Regional District of Kootenay Boundary and provincial government representatives was waiting to talk water management, flood mitigation and protecting wells and aquifers. Among some of the key concerns was protecting the aquifer as longer dry periods and more people tap into the water supply. While the aquifer supplying Grand Forks is one of the biggest in the southern half of the province, many were concerned with it not being recharged over longer drought periods. As well, the rivers that run through the area, namely the Kettle and Granby, are running lower for longer and as RDKB Area C Director Grace McGregor pointed out, there is a real chance they could run dry by 2050. On the other end was preserving riparian areas from floodcaused erosion. Brian Thomas, president of the B.C. Cattlemens Association, spoke about more natural protections for those areas, such as invisible fencing for cattle herds to allow wildlife to roam freely, while at the same time keeping livestock out. Such measures would help restore riparian areas, allowing natural moisture retention, he said. Another concern was water quality. The aquifer supplying the area is vulnerable to poisoning from industrial and agricultural accidents, such as oil spills, mine tailings and nitrate contamination, pointed out Kristina Anderson, watershed planner for RDKB. There are few measures in place for people to rest their water quality, unless they do it privately. Eby said its clear the province is on the right track in implementing bringing water use under one ministry to manage this critical resource for all people and stakeholders, but there is more to be done to secure the regions and provinces water supply. We made the right move with creating this ministry to integrate how we manage this precious resource that is so important to families that turn on the tap, as well as business owners and farmers that rely on it. Its also clear to me we have a lot to do to make sure we are managing this resource for the benefit of all British Columbians.|1

The 2015 Master Plan would need to be revised to accommodate a terminal junction in a manner that responds to the objectives of the Master Plan. Given that under grounding of this infrastructure would impact the entire length of the park, Master Plan implementation would largely be paused during this time.|By Pepper Parr October 22nd, 2023 BURLINGTON, ON The Region issued an update on changes that have been made or will be made on the Beachway Waterfront Park. The report covered the ongoing implementation of the Master Plan for the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park, and sought Councils approval of modifications to the Master Plan as well as next stages of implementation. The latest stage of work involved the completion of a comprehensive set of technical feasibility studies to define constraints and opportunities relative to the natural environment that will inform detailed design and construction plans. The Feasibility Study process is now complete and has resulted in nine specific modifications to the Master Plan that are being recommended for approval by Council through this Report. The report also provides includes an update on the status of the 2015 Acquisition Strategy. Of the privately owned lands identified for acquisition to accommodate the Burlington Beach Master Plan, six properties remain in private ownership. The next stage of the project is the design and construction planning phase. Activities will be focused on detailed design of amenities as well as the environmental restoration and this work will be initiated in the Fall of 2023. Background This report provides an update on the implementation of the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park approved Master Plan, and seeks Councils direction on amendments of the Master Plan that have resulted from the Master Plan Feasibility Studies as well as direction on the Hydro Tower relocation. The last update on the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park, commonly referred to as Beachway Park, was provided in October 2020 through Report No. LPS8820 re Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park Update. The Master Plan for the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park was developed in partnership with the City of Burlington and Conservation Halton and was approved by Regional Council in May 2015, which established a plan for securing the necessary lands needed to implement the Master Plan based on a willing buyerwilling seller program. As part of the 2016 Budget and Forecast, Regional Council approved a detailed financial plan to implement the Master Plan and the Acquisition Strategy that budgeted 51.8 million over a 20year period. Through the 2019 Budget and Business Plan, the financial plan was adjusted to 62.0 million to reflect revised market conditions and support an accelerated property acquisition strategy allocated as follows 23.8 million for park development, 12.2 million for hydro tower relocation and 26.0 million for property acquisition. Through the 2021 Budget process, the Hydro Tower component was adjusted to reflect the midlevel cost estimate identified of 23.0 million. The 2015 Master Plan is divided into six distinct park character areas. The specific timing and staging of works was envisioned to focus on implementation of Areas 1 through 4 in the first 510 years, followed by Areas 5 and 6 once property acquisition was completed. Since the Master Plan was approved in 2015, activities to implement the Master Plan have been focused on Haltons efforts to Advance enhancements in the Spencer Smith portion of the park that received Federal funding under the Canada 150 Community Infrastructure Program Complete of a set of feasibility studies for Beachway Park. The next stage of the project is the design and construction planning phase, activities will be focused on design of amenities and will include building resilience of Beachway Park to the impacts of flooding and erosion. The design and construction planning phase will be initiated in the Fall of 2023. Flooding and erosion were subjects that got little in the way of discussion in 2015 today both are top of mind. Technical feasibility studies have been underway over the last several years which were completed in May of 2023, and are now at a point to provide recommendations for updates to the Master Plan. Feasibility Studies The latest stage of work involved the completion of a comprehensive set of technical feasibility studies to define constraints and opportunities relative to the natural environment that will inform detailed design and construction plans. These studies were required to identify and mitigate potential construction and longterm maintenance risks, inform the preparation of detailed design documents, and position the project to obtain relevant permits and approvals for construction. Collectively, the findings of the studies confirmed whether the features of the 2015 Master Plan can feasibly be implemented and provide a road map for how best to restore the natural environment and improve Beachway Park as intended. In coordination with the project steering team, the consultant for the project developed an Indigenous Peoples Engagement Plan. The Indigenous Peoples Engagement Plan identifies relevant Indigenous and First Nations stakeholders and proposes an engagement strategy to involve these communities in the development and implementation of Burlington Beach. The Indigenous Peoples Engagement Plan is meant to remain a living document throughout the project and may need adjustments from time to time as the overall project progresses. Engagement will ensure meaningful engagement with the key Indigenous stakeholders identified. A key finding of the feasibility studies is the susceptibility of Beachway Park to increasing flooding and erosion. The natural beach and dune environment of Beachway Park is a rare ecosystem and without appropriate management approaches, it will remain extremely sensitive to disturbance, and ultimately habitat loss. The Park shoreline occurs along Lake Ontario, known to have large storm events 1972 and extreme water levels 2017, 2019 which have impacted adjacent development periodically. The spatial extent of the Flood Hazard Limit for existing conditions was mapped at Beachway Park. The results of the flooding analysis highlight the flood vulnerability of not only the beach and dune environment at the park, but also Lakeshore Road and the interior lands proposed for the park expansion. The term XXyear flood is used to describe the recurrence interval of floods. The 100year recurrence interval means that a flood of that magnitude has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year. A 100year flood, although less frequent than a 10year flood, is deeper and far more destructive. For this reason, the 100year flood is now more commonly used as a baseline for risk planning. The foundation for the implementation of the Master Plan includes physical works to restore, and protect from future impacts, beach and dune areas as well as restoring vegetation to secure the beach and dune ecosystems. The Beach and Dune Restoration Plan provides the details of a naturebased solution to restore the foredunes at Beachway Park and along with engineered headlands at the north end of the park. Restoring the dune system can build the necessary resiliency of the Park against erosive forces that occur during periods of high lake levels and severe storm events. Dune rehabilitation can also generate multiple cobenefits, including protecting infrastructure from coastal hazards, reducing maintenance costs associated with windblown sand, enhancing the beach for recreation, enhancing the ecosystem and maintaining beach width during periods of high lake levels. The flood risk was reevaluated based on the dune restoration in the beach management plan. The 100year flood is contained on the beach and the interior flood risk is significantly reduced, as seen in Figure 2. Feasibility of the Features of the 2015 Master Plan To assist in advancing elements of the 2015 Master Plan to detailed design, the technical feasibility of planned improvements to Beachway Park have been assessed. There are modifications to the approved Master Plan that are necessary to address feasibility challenges that have been identified as summarized below. The modifications proposed for the Burlington Beach Master Plan are included as Attachment 2. Through this report, staff are seeking Councils approval of the proposed modifications to the Master Plan. Although the proposed modifications alter the positioning of some features, the intent of the 2015 Master Plan in terms of intent and function is maintained. For this reason, staff recommend that the Master Plan be modified as described below Implementation of Master Plan Features Next Steps Similar to other Regional waterfront parks, a phased approach is proposed, where Master Plan Features will be bundled into a number of work packages for detailed design and construction. The work packages will have a spatial focus and align with the five zones within the 2015 Master Plan. The Cobble Beach Feature formerly The Living Shoreline The construction of the armour stone engineered headlands is proposed to be advanced first as this work underpins and supports restoration of the beach and the backdune areas and could take multiple construction seasons to complete. The headlands are a stone feature which are engineered to prevent beach erosion and is consistent with the shoreline to the north including Spencer Smith Park which is almost entirely armoured. Detailed design is expected to begin in 2024. The anticipated construction schedule will be informed by input from the Region and Partners and consider the current use of the Park. The Strand and the Wind Beach Features The construction of Master Plan elements associated with The Strand and Wind Beach are proposed to be advanced together given similarities in the physical works to be advanced and the integrated nature of such works. Detailed design could take place in between 2024 and 2025. A schedule for The Strand and Wind Beach will require further development. The Commons Features The schedule for advancing key Master Plan elements associated with the Commons, in particular a realigned Lakeshore Road, is contingent on acquiring properties to support proposed works. Given that the road realignment will influence how other Master Plan elements in this area are designed and constructed, it is assumed that design of Master Plan elements associated with The Commons, are not advanced until property acquisition is sufficiently complete. The Skyway and Federal Pier Features Advancing the Master Plan key elements associated with the Skyway i.e., pier upgrades and new road from the Skyway to the Canada Centre for Inland Waters CCIW is contingent on the development of an agreement with Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority and acquisition of remaining land needed to build the road. As such, the schedule for implementing The Skyway identifies efforts focused on land acquisition and the development of an agreement with Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority. It is assumed that, pending resolution of access considerations, a schedule for the design and construction of specific Master Plan elements associated with The Skyway, will be developed and the Master Plan Implementation Schedule updated accordingly. A preliminary location of the southern terminal junction has been identified within the Wind Beach character area in the 2015 Master Plan. This area is envisioned to be a passive naturalized area, showcasing the natural dune environment and trails. The 2015 Master Plan would need to be revised to accommodate a terminal junction in a manner that responds to the objectives of the Master Plan. This would result in the loss of 4900 square metres from the park and Master Plan features intended for this area. Further, easements around the structures and underground transmission cables will be required along the entire beach corridor and are still to be determined. In order to pursue this option with these significant easement requirements, the Master Plan would require significant revisions to reflect a potential underground route while competing with planned park amenities. HONI has indicated its willingness to work with the Region to ensure there is due consideration for park activities that can reasonably occur within the easement area, with considerations for safety, operational and maintenance access needs, however the amount of area required for the easements is substantial. The location of the northern terminal junction at the intersection of Elgin Street and Brock Avenue is dependent on the availability of the land owned by the City of Burlington, which is currently used to support public parking and a small park. Should it not be possible to acquire a suitable offsite location, the park would have to further accommodate the second terminal junction with the same space and buffer requirements identified above. Timing Initiatives to support Master Plan Implementation such as the Feasibility Studies, and Acquisition Strategy have advanced to a stage where the detailed design and construction phase of Master Plan features can begin. The first phase of Master Plan implementation will focus on increasing the resilience of Beachway Park to erosion and flooding impacts. In advance of detailed design, gaining closure with respect to the alignment of the HONI transmission corridor becomes critical. Should Regional Council decide to pursue undergrounding the transmission lines the work will be subject to a multiyear approval and construction process. Based on the complexity of this project, the approval and construction process of two and a half to over four years can be expected. Given that under grounding of this infrastructure would impact the entire length of the park, Master Plan implementation would largely be paused during this time. Following extensive work and investigation, the underground option has been identified as the only potentially feasible option available to reduce the visual impact of the HONI towers at Beachway Park. Given the barriers identified through the study completed, staff are recommending that Council no longer pursue the relocation of the hydro towers. Alternatives for Relocating the Hydro Towers in the Longterm Through the review of the Hamilton SubRegion Integrated Regional Resource Plan prepared by the Independent Electricity System Operator IESO dated February 25, 2019, it was identified that as part of the Middleport Area Bulk Transmission Planning Study, replacement options for the Beach Transformer Station autotransformers will be investigated. The Beach Transformer Station autotransformers are located in Hamilton and provide power transfer between the 230kV and 115kV transmission systems. Since the study will be considering the bulk system in the area, including the transmission corridor through Beachway Park, there is a possibility that it could result in a change to the requirements of the existing alignment. The study is intended to be initiated in 2027 as per the 2019 IESO plan and is unlikely to result in the implementation of the alignment options studied to date. However, if an opportunity exists for optimizing a transmission corridor such that it would make this waterfront section redundant this could be pursued at that time. Update on Other Initiatives and Activities at Burlington Beach While the Feasibility Studies and Master Plan Implementation Plan were being developed, there have been other initiatives and activities that have continued to advance at Burlington Beach. This section provides an update on those initiatives and activities. Status of Property Acquisition Strategy As outlined in the Burlington Beach Acquisition Strategy, staff estimated that the original market value estimate for the properties identified by the program would experience year over year market growth. The actual market growth seen in the Burlington area was notably higher than anticipated year over year which has led to acquisition costs being higher than anticipated. The 2015 Acquisition Strategy has led to the successful acquisition of 21 properties in the Burlington Beach area. Federal Pier The City of Burlington is working with the Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority towards an agreement for public access of the pier. Hamilton Oshawa Port Authoritys position is that they will carry out repairs, and the City will assume subsequent repairs, along with all operations. Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority will be undertaking a navigational dredging program at the Burlington Canal adjacent to Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park in 2023. Dredged material will be transported and disposed in the water adjacent to Burlington Beach and will help replenish the eroded beach area. Once the use agreement for public access to the pier between the City and Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority is finalized, the design and construction of pier features can be planned as part of the Skyway work, as mentioned above. Parking A request was made for Halton Region and City of Burlington staff to coordinate to provide additional parking options in the Burlington Beach Waterfront Park area to address historical deficiencies. These discussions were initiated in the Spring of 2023, and identified an option to temporarily assign parking ahead of the design and construction of the park features that are identified for these locations. As this is a short term solution to increase parking, this may result in the need to identify long term options to increase parking at Burlington Beach. Regional and City staff will work in partnership to support an assessment of long term options which can be completed as part of detailed design stages. Any proposed modifications to the Master Plan will be brought forward for Regional Council consideration. Archaeological Field Work One of the key deliverables of the project was to create a Cultural Heritage Assessment and Stage 1 Archaeological Assessment. In accordance with the 2011 Standards and Guidelines for Consultant Archaeologists, the Stage 1 assessment determined that the study area included areas of archaeological potential, areas of no archaeological potential and previously assessed lands of no further concern. All identified areas of archaeological potential proposed to be disturbed as part of park development were subject to a Stage 2 property assessment. Completion of fieldwork to support the Stage 2 Archaeological Assessment began in Fall 2021 and resumed in Spring 2022. As a result of the Stage 2 assessment, one site was identified to be of further cultural heritage value or interest and will require Stage 3 sitespecific assessment. The procurement process to initiate a Stage 3 assessment closed in May of 2023, with field work to commence in 2023 Dune Grass Pilot The beach features a pilot sand dune restoration site where native grass species have been planted to aid in the stabilization of the foredune from erosion. In late May 2023, four concrete base sign holders were installed in front of the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 foredune restoration sites. The beachgrass is surviving as anticipated and sand is accumulating in the foredune as desired to restore the dune structures. Further work on this pilot study will continue into Fall 2023. Where are they now Since the last update report to Regional Council in July of 2022, staff and project partners have been working to finalize the feasibility studies and lay the groundwork for key Council decisions which will direct the next stage of work on the implementation of the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park Master Plan. With technical feasibility studies complete, work will focus on design and construction of the restoration of the natural environment. From there, the design and development of the park features and amenities will begin. Once direction is provided by Council on the hydro tower relocation option, staff will advance the next stages of work on this project. Financialprogram implications Staff will continue to monitor and provide updates on the financial requirements of the implementation of the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park Master Plan. When it comes to land acquisition, staff will continue to secure the necessary lands required to implement the Master Plan as identified through Report No. CA 0923 CS 0923 re Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park Update. As a result of the proposed modifications and changes, including what was budgeted for the removal of the Hydro Tower Relocation, it is proposed that the 2024 Budget and forecast be updated as follows Staff will address and further refine capital and operating impacts related to the Burlington Beach Waterfront Park Master Plan and land securement through the 2024 Budget process and future staff reports if required. This is a project that seems to have lost its way.|1

On Saturday, the German state of SchleswigHolstein was forced to evacuate thousands of residents, and the damage resulting from the disaster is estimated at hundreds of millions of euros. Serious damage was also reported in Denmark. Storm Babbitt, called Victor in Germany, struck on Saturday in the western part of the Baltic Sea, and also caused heavy damage in the British Isles. In some places, water levels rose more than 220 cm above normal from Friday night to Saturday, the worst flood in more than a century. On Sunday morning, the waters receded and damage assessments began in coastal areas. A tragic outcome in Germany The situation was particularly difficult in the federal state of SchleswigHolstein in northern Germany. In the city of Flensburg, where particularly high storm gusts were recorded, the sea submerged the port and surrounding buildings. The port of Schleswig was also damaged by floods. Baltic waves broke through the embankments and destroyed the beach fortifications and buildings. Many boats sank. Its a complete disaster. I dont know how many ships sank. There are masts sticking out everywhere, a port employee told NDR. On Friday evening, media reported that a woman died on the Baltic Sea island of Fehmarn after her car collided with a tree that fell due to a storm. Ralph Kirchhoff, head of emergency services at the Interior Ministry in SchleswigHolstein, also reported on Saturday morning that about two thousand residents of the federal state had been evacuated. He added that the damage caused by the element could reach hundreds of millions of euros. Dangerous in Denmark Babbitt also influenced the people of Denmark. The southern part of the Jutland Peninsula was particularly exposed to the storm. Floods occurred in the town of Haderslev and surrounding towns, and the waters damaged roads along the coast. Strong winds and high waves also threatened residents of the Danish islands, with devastation reported, among other islands, on Zeeland and Lolland. The waves also led to the complete destruction of a historic summer house in Skildekopple, dating back to the 1920s.

Nottinghamshire County Council declared a major incident and told people in Retford they were at risk over high water levels along the River Idle. The river reached record levels on Sunday, with water still rising. More flooding is possible for parts of England until Wednesday due to further rain, the Environment Agency has said. Five severe flood warnings were lifted on Sunday evening two were for the River Idle in the East Midlands and three were for the River Derwent in Derby. But areas along the River Severn, Britains largest river, will be affected in the coming days, and the agency is warning that widespread flooding is probable in parts of the Midlands and the North of England. Retford resident Brendan Hunt was forced to evacuated his home and fears the damage to his property from flooding could be endless. The water is still right up to the threshold of the front door, he told the PA News Agency. He said that he was at home moving as many of his possessions as possible upstairs until the early hours of Sunday, adding that he believes he will have to replace all of his downstairs flooring if the water gets in. Residents in up to 500 homes have been asked to leave their homes there Rain is forecast to ease in the UK on Sunday, but there are still danger to life warnings in place Water levels in the River Idle are expected to peak at 2000 BST on Sunday. A temporary shelter has been set up at Retford Leisure Centre to help residents affected by the unprecedented situation, Nottinghamshire County Council said. There were also recordbreaking water levels in the River Derwent nearby in Derbyshire this weekend, with authorities warning that cleaning up after the floods could take days. Meanwhile, a woman in her 80s, named by her son as Maureen Gilbert, has died in Chesterfield after her home was flooded. Paul Gilbert said emergency services had tried to rescue Mrs Gilbert on Friday but were unable to enter the property. Mr Gilbert found his mother in the water the following morning. Story continues Derbyshire Police said the cause of her death remained uncertain but investigations were continuing. In other developments Flooding is probable on some larger rivers including the Severn, Ouse and Trent through to Tuesday, the Environment Agency says Serious damage has been caused in the Marykirk area, where a man was reported missing The Environment Agency has warned flooding along major rivers in England could continue for days due to further heavy rain. Parts of Yorkshire and the Humber and the East Midlands may see more flooding on Monday, the agency said. Katharine Smith, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said teams are on the ground helping local communities. Temporary defences, including pumps and barriers, have been deployed to minimise the impact of flooding where needed, she said. Flood gates have also been closed in affected areas. We also advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and urge people not to drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car. Emergency services helping people to evacuate their homes in Brechin, Angus, on Saturday Roads and bridges across Scotland have been badly damaged including here near Dundee BBC Weather forecaster Gemma Plumb said There were a number of places in north and east England, and in Scotland, that saw at least a months worth of rain in a few days as a result of Storm Babet, with one or two places seeing closer to twice the average monthly rainfall one of which was Wattisham in Suffolk. But Met Office spokesman Dave Britton said those worst affected by the flooding could see a couple of quieter days. He added there were no Met Office weather warnings in force for the remainder of the week, except for one on ice in Scotland on Sunday night. There is this pulse of rain moving its way north overnight later on Monday and into Tuesday, but the rest of the week does look like it remains rather unsettled with spells of rain at times, Mr Britton continued. Experts say climate change makes extreme flooding events more likely because a warming atmosphere increases the chance of intense rainfall. However, many factors contribute to flooding and it takes time for scientists to calculate how much impact climate change has had on particular weather events if any. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

An example of this living arrangement is seen in the Central New Brunswick Woodmens Museum. Museum vicepresident Greg Munn said community members showed up and helped to clear out the water and save artifacts during the flood. In 2021, water rushed down the hill behind the museum and into the building, damaging artifacts and archives. Theres no better place to experience the history of a place than to be in that place, she said.|Lumber camps were once a way of life for many New Brunswickers during the long winter months. They would crowd into small shacks, sleep sidebyside and eat meals on long wooden benches before beginning the days logging. The lumbermen would work other jobs as well, such as farming and acting as fishing guides on the Miramichi River. Original pieces of this history are still kept in the province to this day in Boiestown on the 15acre property of the Central New Brunswick Woodmens Museum. Lumbermen would crowd into small shacks and sleep sidebyside on the same beds. An example of this living arrangement is seen in the Central New Brunswick Woodmens Museum. Michael HeenanCBC The collection of axes, canoes, tree bark and replicas, along with cabins and Quonset huts, tells the story of the men who worked in the camps. But two years ago, that history was put at risk of disappearing because of a flood that destroyed artifacts and paper archives in the museums main building. Now, with the help of government funding and community members, vicepresident Greg Munn said the museum is finally getting its chin above water. The lumbering industry was important to New Brunswick in general, and it plays a big part in the history of where weve come from and the hard work thats been put into settling these small towns and villages, said Munn. Museum vicepresident Greg Munn said community members showed up and helped to clear out the water and save artifacts during the flood. Hannah RudderhamCBC And I think its important that we can look back and appreciate the work thats been done to see where we are today. In April 2021, Munn got a call during the early hours of the morning after just getting off a night shift. The museum director at the time told him the main building was filling with water. Munn rushed to the property, about a 20minute drive, and even though the door had been opened to let water flow out, he said it was still knee deep. Within the hour, the fire department was there and community members came to help. In 2021, water rushed down the hill behind the museum and into the building, damaging artifacts and archives. Submitted by Christine Jean We had volunteers show up and we were filling sandbags and pushing out water and trying to save artifacts and putting them up to the second floor. So it was a hectic day, Munn recalled. Christine Jean, the current director of the museum, said she was made aware of the flood during her interview for the job last year. She said she was told that some artifacts and archives were damaged during a flood, but it wasnt until she began in her new role that she realized the extent of the problem . Today, piles of archival material still sit in freezers at the museum awaiting digitization, in an attempt to stop the waterdamaged papers from becoming mouldy. Museum director Christine Jean stands next to a large berm that was built on the property to stop and absorb any water flowing downhill. Michael HeenanCBC The flooding caused damage to the main buildings foundation and all the carpets needed to be replaced, said Jean. A large berm was built on the property to stop and absorb any water flowing downhill. and additional culverts were added to the stream for better water flow. The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and the Regional Development Corporation contributed just over 208,000 for the repairs, while the remaining 10 per cent will be paid for by the museum. Water damaged archives still sit in the freezer at the museum to prevent the growth of mould. Michael HeenanCBC Still, Jean said for the nonprofit, 10 per cent is a lot when referring to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Along with that, at the time of the flood, the museum incurred high costs in the form of hydro bills as dehumidifiers were running constantly and the heat had to be cranked to dry out the building. Despite the mountain of costs, Jean said preserving the history is important. Theres no better place to experience the history of a place than to be in that place, she said. So this is a place where lumbering is really important. It has contributed to the lives of almost everybody who lives here and to be able to understand and explore that history, theres no better place than here.|1

Translation is another thorny area, with some industry players feeling artificial intelligence would miss the nuances and subtleties needed to render complex literature into other languages. Efforts are being made to make it clearer when AI has been involved in producing a book.|Book industry grapples with AI FRANKFURT From lowquality computerwritten books flooding the market to potential copyright violations, publishing is the latest industry to feel the threat from rapid developments in artificial intelligence. Since the launch last year of ChatGPT, an easytouse AI chatbot that can deliver an essay upon request within seconds, there have been growing worries about the impact of generative AI on a range of sectors. Among book industry players there is a deep sense of insecurity, said Juergen Boos, director of the Frankfurt Book Fair, the worlds biggest, where the topic was in focus last week. They are asking what happens to authors intellectual property Who does new content actually belong to How do we bring this into value chains he said. The threat is plain to see AI writing programs allow budding authors to produce in a matter of day novels that could in the past have taken months or years to write. A flood of titles that list ChatGPT as a coauthor have been offered for sale through Amazons ebook selfpublishing unit. Still, critics say the works are of low quality and sense little threat from AI for now. British author Salman Rushdie told a press conference at the fair that recently someone asked an AI writing tool to produce 300 words in his style. And what came out was pure garbage, said the Midnights Children writer, to laughter from the audience. Anybody who has ever read 300 words of mine would immediately recognize that it could not possibly be by me. So far Im not that alarmed, he added, during a rare public appearance since a nearfatal stabbing attack last year in the United States. HH Still not great Jennifer Becker, a German author and academic, echoed his sentiments, telling a panel discussion that the results when it comes to AI writing fiction are still not that great. There is a lot of potential to use it to use it collaboratively. But I still dont see the point where we really hand over the writing work to AI completely autonomously. That wouldnt make for an interesting book. Industry players stress however that in some areas there is more openness to dealing with artificial intelligence. It depends a bit on the genre, said Susanne Barwick, deputy legal adviser of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association, who has been in discussion about AI with publishers. The field of science and specialist books is already further along and has already dealt with it more. These areas were easier than the field of fiction, where I think at the moment people still tend to look a bit more at the risks, she added. Artificial intelligences relationship with publishing threatens to throw up a host of legal problems, with one major grey area being who owns copyright of AIgenerated content, said fair director Boos. Then you get into a real mess, and it is a huge theme. There is also really a lot of money involved, he said. There are already AIrelated legal clashes involving top writers. Last month, Game of Thrones author George RR Martin, John Grisham and Jodi Picoult were among several writers who filed a classaction lawsuit against ChatGPT creator OpenAI over alleged violation of copyrights. Along with the Authors Guild, an organization representing writers, they accused the Californiabased company of using their books without permission to train ChatGPTs large language models, algorithms capable of producing humansounding text responses based on simple queries, according to the lawsuit. Translation is another thorny area, with some industry players feeling artificial intelligence would miss the nuances and subtleties needed to render complex literature into other languages. Efforts are being made to make it clearer when AI has been involved in producing a book. Amazon recently released new guidelines that require authors who want to sell books through its selfpublishing unit to tell the company in advance if their work includes material generated using artificial intelligence. And some recognize the opportunities when it comes to AI and writing for example, in producing stereotypical romance novels. This, Boos joked, could bring some relief that people dont have to deal with that kind of content anymore, and it can simply be generated at home on the computer.|1

Great Wall Motor plans to build a plant in Europe and Germany was one of the candidates for the site, the German publication Automobilwoche said in May. Brussels began the investigation this month to decide whether to set up tariff barriers against what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called a flood of cheaper Chinese EV imports benefiting from state subsidies. It is examining EVs made both by Chinese manufacturers and foreign firms, such as Tesla NASDAQ , BMW and Renault EPA , in China. China has complained about the very short time the EU set for consultations on the inquiry, saying it lacked adequate evidence and did not conform to the rules of the World Trade Organization WTO. European car makers are racing to catch up with China in turning out lowercost EVs, especially as the likes of Chinese manufacturers BYD, Xpeng NYSE and Nio look to expand overseas.

Ms. Rowling has been denounced as transphobic as part of a flood of social media abuse, some of it from high profile celebrities, making headlines around the globe. Ms. Hamm was quoted in a CBC article about the billboard, saying, Womens rights are important and we need to stand up for them and its not transphobic to do so. The sign was only up for 30 hours before the billboard company, Pattison Outdoor, covered it up and then took it down. By then, the sign had already been vandalized with paint. After complaints were made to the College, an Inquiry Committee launched an investigation in November 2020 and subsequently compiled a 332page report, mostly composed of social media posts and statements by Ms. Hamm. Three years later, the hearings are far from concluded. The next hearings are, as before, in front of a panel of British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives and will run for 10 nonconsecutive days.

Ms. Hamm is accused of being discriminatory and derogatory toward transgender people in the course of her offduty advocacy for womens sexbased rights. Professional regulators are created by statute and are essentially an arm of the state, to which the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies. Nonetheless, many regulators are increasingly attempting to control what professionals are permitted to say or believe on the social and political issues of our time. This will put a chill on debate and discussion outside of only a narrow range of permissible views. An enforced consensus, where professionals who disagree keep silent for fear of losing their livelihoods, cannot be in the public interest. This is especially so in matters of science and public policy, where stifling debate prevents both science and democracy from functioning as intended. The colleges of nurses, colleges of doctors, colleges of psychologists, law societies and other regulators need to stop policing speech and stop abusing their authority by forcing woke ideology on good people like Amy Hamm, stated John Carpay, President of the Justice Centre.|1

Acknowledging the acceleration of these projects as a step in the right direction, Mayor Matthew Shoemaker says its imperative the city receives access to increased power and energy amid other ongoing energy projects like the PUCs communitywide smart grid.|Hydro One and First Nations have been collaborating on early planning of three new transmission lines, with First Nations having chance to invest in a 50 per cent equity stake The provinces Minister of Energy paid a visit to Sault Ste. Marie this morning to announce the acceleration on a trio of transmission line projects two of which have local implications. Ontario says the projects, which will be developed by Hydro One, will help power Algoma Steels conversion to its future electric arc furnace, as well as support new homes, critical mineral development, and a number of job creators. More and more people are moving to our province, and we need a plan for Ontarios clean energy future, Energy Minister Todd Smith told a group of dignitaries on Monday. No plan can be successful without a transmission buildout to get that electricity to the homes and businesses that are eventually going to need that. Minister Smith said the two lines that will run between the Sault and Sudbury are critical to supplying Algoma Steels transition to electric arc furnaces and that they will support additional load connections in the Sault Ste. Marie area and increase transfer capacity into northwestern Ontario. According to the province, the transmission lines are promised to be operational in 2029 the same year Algoma Steel intends to fully transition to electric arc steelmaking. This forwardthinking investment paves the way for regional economic prosperity and positions Algoma Steel at the forefront of green steel production in Canada, Algoma Steel CEO Michael Garcia said in a news release. Minister Smith continued by saying he has directed the Ontario Energy Board to declare each of the three new transmission lines as priority projects so they can be in service sooner. The projects include The Mississagi to Third Line an approximately 75 km, 230kilovolt transmission line between Mississagi Transformer Station west of Sudbury and Third Line Transformer Station Sault Ste. Marie an approximately 75 km, 230kilovolt transmission line between Mississagi Transformer Station west of Sudbury and Third Line Transformer Station Sault Ste.

Marie on Monday, Hydro One CEO David Lebeter said these projects are a significant step towards both decarbonizing our local industries and making future jobcreating investments in our region possible. The province also announced that First Nations will have the chance to invest in a 50 per cent equity stake in the transmission line component to the projects once complete, through Hydro Ones Equity Partnership model. Joined by Batchewana First Nation Chief Mark McCoy, Garden River First Nation Chief Karen Bell, and Chief Craig Nootchai of Atikameksheng Anishnawbek First Nation, Minister Smith noted the projects will create significant economic and partnership opportunities for Indigenous communities and can help advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Ontario. We want to thank Todd Smith and his team for taking the time to meet with us and hearing our concerns about these projects, Chief Craig Nootchai said.

Marie this morning to announce the acceleration on a trio of transmission line projects two of which have local implications. Ontario says the projects, which will be developed by Hydro One, will help power Algoma Steels conversion to its future electric arc furnace, as well as support new homes, critical mineral development, and a number of job creators. More and more people are moving to our province, and we need a plan for Ontarios clean energy future, Energy Minister Todd Smith told a group of dignitaries on Monday. No plan can be successful without a transmission buildout to get that electricity to the homes and businesses that are eventually going to need that. Minister Smith said the two lines that will run between the Sault and Sudbury are critical to supplying Algoma Steels transition to electric arc furnaces and that they will support additional load connections in the Sault Ste. Marie area and increase transfer capacity into northwestern Ontario. According to the province, the transmission lines are promised to be operational in 2029 the same year Algoma Steel intends to fully transition to electric arc steelmaking. This forwardthinking investment paves the way for regional economic prosperity and positions Algoma Steel at the forefront of green steel production in Canada, Algoma Steel CEO Michael Garcia said in a news release. Minister Smith continued by saying he has directed the Ontario Energy Board to declare each of the three new transmission lines as priority projects so they can be in service sooner. The projects include The Mississagi to Third Line an approximately 75 km, 230kilovolt transmission line between Mississagi Transformer Station west of Sudbury and Third Line Transformer Station Sault Ste. Marie an approximately 75 km, 230kilovolt transmission line between Mississagi Transformer Station west of Sudbury and Third Line Transformer Station Sault Ste.

Marie on Monday, Hydro One CEO David Lebeter said these projects are a significant step towards both decarbonizing our local industries and making future jobcreating investments in our region possible. The province also announced that First Nations will have the chance to invest in a 50 per cent equity stake in the transmission line component to the projects once complete, through Hydro Ones Equity Partnership model. Joined by Batchewana First Nation Chief Mark McCoy, Garden River First Nation Chief Karen Bell, and Chief Craig Nootchai of Atikameksheng Anishnawbek First Nation, Minister Smith noted the projects will create significant economic and partnership opportunities for Indigenous communities and can help advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Ontario. We want to thank Todd Smith and his team for taking the time to meet with us and hearing our concerns about these projects, Chief Craig Nootchai said.

The Environment Agency has estimated around 1,250 properties in England were impacted last week, although a further 30,000 were allegedly protected from any flood damage. At least four people have died since Babet reached the UK. The environment secretary went to see affected residents in Retford, a market town in Nottinghamshire, on Monday, after she was invited by Conservative MP Brendan ClarkeSmith. But, Coffeys encounters with the local population didnt seem to go down very well as Sky News caught on camera. When Coffey approached her for a chat, local Lucy Rose, told the cabinet minister If youre asking me what I think, please dont... The minister acknowledged that it is very upsetting, adding that she has personal experience of this kind of disaster. Rose replied, I dont know what day it is, before explaining how she had struggled to find any accommodation when her home was flooded. Its not a home anymore, its just a shell of water... the resident explained. She also noted that she is going to have to fork out and redo her home, and that she wants it all to be on the government, adding We cant deal with it anymore. Another resident chimed in, saying To be honest, we dont want to be here anymore. Rose also said once her home was flooded, she didnt know what to do. She said I sat for an hour and a half in the pub car park, in the dark, because we didnt know where to go. Rose continued Because everybody we contacted didnt help, nobody replied, I phoned the police, they couldnt do anything, I phoned the fire brigade, they couldnt do anything. They came, 10 minutes later the police moved my car, reversed it into next door neighbours car, and left that, then told us they could get us out. Story continues She added she had to get her 17yearold daughter of the house in her bare feet. Another person said that it flooded exactly the same as it before and we were just left again. The neighbour continued This is again this has happened... we were just left to our own devices. To that, Coffey just said Ive come today, Brendan invited me to come up, understanding the impact, particularly because of the timeliness of the warnings. The Environment Agency has predicted that some places could remain flooded until Wednesday, especially as more rain is on its way. We were left to our own devices again.

There was no real reason for her to be here, just to show her face that shes been. Thats it really. She said the whole of the street is struggling, but that people have been pulling together, even after not receiving a lot of help. When questioned by journalists, Coffey explained that the UK has invested 2.6 million in flood defences across the UK between 2015 and 2021 and is looking to spend 5.2 million more over a sixyear time period. Im conscious that doesnt matter to them, Coffey said, referring to the disgruntled residents she was visiting, but claimed she felt it was still important to see people whose lives have been affected. Im conscious of that with my own constituency, and of course the people who have lost their lives, Coffey added, saying she was looking for practical responses to the flooding. Asked by Sky News why it had taken her so long to come up and visit, Coffey said she had been meeting people, and that it was important politicians dont get caught up in operational responses.

Although airport fence was built to prevent wild animals from using runway as a pathway to somewhere else, it served another purpose in the story about to unfold. The December 31, 1959, RecordGazette reported Somewhat bleak prospects for nine passengers bound for Yellowknife on regular PWA airliner on Christmas Eve came when the plane lost traction on a patch of ice, skidded down the runway, crashed through a wire fence, and landed in the ditch at the southwestern end of the airport. But fears of failing to reach their destination in time for Christmas were soon allayed as word came that a second plane would arrive in midafternoon to transport passengers and cargo on to Yellowknife. In addition to the passengers, the ditched plane carried huge quantities of express, including dozens of boxes of fresh cut flowers to brighten a town where Christmas trees are virtually nonobtainable, and a couple of cartons of live and chipper canaries and budgie birds. Pilot of the plane, thoroughly experienced and familiar with the local airport, had taken off in the same manner many times in the past with no suggestion of impending mishap on this occasion the plane simply failed to make the turn after taxiing to the far end of the runway. Comparatively little damage was done, and no one was injured. Within approximately an hour Cats and winches were busily extricating the craft from its undignified position. Although type of aircraft was not indicated, research suggests it could have been either a Curtiss C46, or a Douglas DC4 both propdriven and flown by PWA.

Article content According to Department of Transportation Air Services Civil Aviation Branch accident report, the aircraft, owned by Associated Airways, operated by PWA, stalled, and crashed on takeoff from Peace River Airport. Experienced pilot Norman W. Skogmo, lone occupant of the plane, emerged relatively unscathed. However, his aircraft, unceremoniously met runway 19 of YPE, Latitude 56 14 N Longitude 117 26W, and 4,000 feet long by 200 feet wide, and 1,860 feet above sea level, was not spared. The accident report documents pilot interview After leaving the ground on takeoff at 65 mph, under recommended speed, when about 10 feet over the runway, the left wing dropped, he was unable to correct for this with aileron and rudder then he added power to left engine, but it did not respond, and both the turn and bank increased he throttled back and landed. Report conclusion The pilot failed to maintain flying speed and was unable to control his aircraft on takeoff.

Article content Soon after the New Years Eve mishap, the 1938manufactured BarkleyGrow CFBLV No. 3 T8P1 aircraft off the line of 11, met disaster January 12, 1960. The former Yukon Queen, one of three BarkleyGrow, owned, and operated by Grant McConachie and his company Yukon Southern Transport YSAT before PWA took ownership. The three aircraft were twinengine, all metal craft with fixed undercarriage to allow for equipping with wheels, skis, or floats as required. The Yukon Queen was the first twinengine, all metal aircraft to operate in Canadas North Country. In her misadventure, she suffered severe damage undercarriage torn off belly of airplane badly buckled and torn and one wing bent. PWA decided it was damaged beyond economical repair. One contemporary source reported it was scrapped on site. However, further research, although that may have been the original intention, revealed a much more interesting story.

Article content By late July, three years after the crash, the remains of the BarkleyGrow CFBLV, stripped of all moveable and useful parts and left to the elements piled near end of runway, was considered by the Peace River Recreation Board as part of a local playground. The Department of Transport wanted PWA to remove the once glorious aircraft described in a May 1939 Canadian Aviation article Through storm and sunshine heat and cold, over field and forest, swamp and mountain, the Yukon Queen rode with a regal serenity befitting her name. The aircraft itself, he describes as a lady shapely, responsive, and mannerly. The August 1, 1963, RecordGazette, noted, as of its publication date, PWA had not responded to Recreation Board offer to move scrapped plane if PWA would donate it. Nevertheless, later in the year, PWA gave the 25yearold incapacitated BarkleyGrow to the Board.

Article content As a result of Recreation Board plan and PWA donation, the big plane spent about 10 years serving the playful needs of the towns children at Water SprayPlay Park, on northeast side of Heart River Bridge, until it was no longer appropriate. Its journey, however, was not over. Twentytwo years after crash, the newly formed Aerospace Museum of Calgary heard in 1982, rumours BLV had not been scrapped in 1960, but had become an interesting piece of equipment for children of all ages to enjoy. Well, as we learned, initially, the remains of CFBLV had been left to the elements at the airport, until Canada Transport asked PWA to remove it. Three years later, it found its new landing in Peace River. The Aerospace Museum found out through a Town administrator, indeed, the aircraft still existed, albeit in a nonfunctioning condition. The Museum was interested, and arrangements were made for CFBLV to make its way to Calgary, where it sat in storage for 14 years.

The Coulson Group of Companies of Port Alberni, B.C. airlifted remains of another crashed BarkleyGrow CFBTX, from Kakwa Lake, B.C. to its headquarters on Vancouver Island with the intention, along with the Aerospace Museum, to restore one of the planes. In 1994, discussions and negotiations began. It was decided, given the history and condition of BLV, its airframe should be restored, rather than that of BTX. To do that, Coulson bought BLV from the Aerospace Museum and contracted with the museum to carry out restorations. BTX was trucked to Calgary and stripped of its parts and used to restore the Yukon Queen. More Yukon Queen insights in next Ponderings.

Understanding the local property tax rates is essential when calculating your overall homeownership costs. The trademarks Realtor, Realtors and the Realtor logo are controlled by the Canadian Real Estate Association CREA and identify real estate professionals who are members of CREA.|Written by David Ahrens, REMAX KAWARTHA LAKESWith the cooler weather being ushered in, many people dream of a sunnier, warmer escape. Buying a property is a significant milestone in anyones life, and when youre considering a move or a second home in the Sunshine State of Florida, there are some unique factors to keep in mind. Florida offers a wide range of real estate options, from beachfront condos to suburban homes with crazynice amenities and everything in between. To ensure a successful and enjoyable househunting experience, here are the top 10 tips for buying a house in Florida. Understand the Florida Market The Florida real estate market is diverse and dynamic. Its essential to familiarize yourself with the states real estate landscape, which varies from city to city and region to region. Factors such as climate, proximity to the beach, local regulations and state laws, and local amenities can significantly influence property values. And remember, as a foreign buyer you may need to pay a foreign withholding tax upon the future disposition sale of any property you purchase up to a rate of 15 of the sale price though, there are exceptions. Factor that in from the beginning and be sure get educated on this topic by consulting your real estate agent, lawyer as well as specialty firms who handle FIRPTA withholdings. Determine Your Budget Financing Before you start searching for a house, its crucial to determine your budget. Consider your current financial situation, your ability to secure financing, and your longterm financial goals. Ensure that you can comfortably afford the monthly mortgage payments, property taxes, and homeowners insurance. Whether youre paying cash or seeking a mortgage, its essential to have your financing in order, including preapproval and proof of funds which often accompany any offer made to a Seller to show you can pay. Mortgage rates, down payment requirements, paying down with points, closing costs and lender regulations can vary, so research your options and choose a financing solution that works best for your situation. If you have a relationship with a Canadian bank with a U.S. subsidiary, thats a good place to start, or alternatively you can look for private lenders, but that will also mean higher mortgage rates. Choose the Right Location Florida is known for its variety of climates and lifestyles. Whether you prefer the bustling city life of Miami, the tranquility of a Gulf Coast beach town or cities like the burgeoning Sarasota area, or the suburban charm of places like Orlando, its important to select the location that suits your lifestyle and preferences. And always research neighbourhoods thoroughly to examine demographic information, crime statistics, and proximity to amenities important to you. Work with a Local Realtor Local real estate agents have valuable knowledge about the Florida market, neighborhoods, and real estate intricacies. They can guide you through the entire homebuying or selling process, from finding the right property to negotiating the deal and handling paperwork. And did you know that Title companies handle the majority of closings in Florida not lawyers But, you always have the choice to use a real estate lawyer to close your transaction, which may be more familiar to you. You can always consult a lawyer about legal issues in a contract should you choose. Be Mindful of Hurricanes and Flooding Florida is susceptible to hurricanes, especially during the hurricane season from June to November. Consider the propertys hurricane readiness, flood risk know your flood zone designation for any target property, and insurance requirements when purchasing a home. Ensure that the house has stormresistant features windows, doors, block construction, etc. and consider investing in a hurricaneproof roof. And be prepared to deal with damage despite all your precautions. Conduct a Thorough Home Inspection and Home Maintenance Due to Floridas unique climate, its crucial to perform a comprehensive home inspection. This includes checking for potential issues like mold, termite infestations, and flood damage. A professional inspection will help you avoid unexpected repair costs. Home inspection options are different in Florida than in Ontario, so ask your real estate agent for referrals. Before you are in a contract to purchase, be sure to pay attention to the myriad of maintenance costs you will be faced with, including grasscutting, fertilizing, pool service, pressure washing service, roof maintenance, pest control termites WDO and other pests, insurance, property taxes, home watch services, property management fees should you rent out your property, and unexpected issues like AC breakdowns, water intrusion, or lanai screen repairs after a storm to name a few. Add all these items to your budget. Consider Homeowner Associations and Condominium Corporations Benefits Restrictions Many Florida communities are governed by homeowner associations HOAs andor Condominium Corporations. These associations have specific rules, fees, and restrictions including on Short Term Rentals that can affect your lifestyle and budget. Make sure you fully understand the HOAs requirements, fees and reserves before making an offer. Factor in Property Taxes Florida is known for having no state income tax, making it an attractive destination for retirees, but this doesnt apply to foreign buyers. Furthermore, property taxes vary from county to county, so be prepared for fluctuating tax rates. Understanding the local property tax rates is essential when calculating your overall homeownership costs. Keep in mind that foreign buyers will have a higher property tax rate than a Florida resident with homestead status. Timing Matters Floridas real estate market experiences seasonal fluctuations. Consider timing your purchase to take advantage of lower prices where possible, which often occur during the summer months when the heat can deter some buyers. However, keep in mind that interest rates and market conditions can change rapidly, so consult your realtor for the best timing strategy. In the relative sense, Floridas market is still fairly hot, so being able to make quick decisions is key to getting what you want. Short Term Rentals Should you decide to purchase an investment property in Florida, its imperative to understand any local and state regulations on STRs as well as restrictions within communities governed by a Homeowners Association HOA or Condominium Corporation. Its not unusual for STRs to have minimum rental period requirements 1 month or more, and maximum number of rentals per year. Know before you buy. Conclusion Buying a house in Florida can be a dream come true, but it requires careful planning and consideration. By following these top 10 tips, you can navigate the Florida real estate market with confidence, ensuring that you find the perfect home in the Sunshine State that fits your budget and lifestyle.

Will the proposed Emergency and Disaster Management Act help progress?|tag:google.com,2013:googlealerts/feed:17935221457105122152|https://thenarwhal.ca/bc-emergency-diaster-management-act/|The proposed Emergency and Disaster Management Act will define how citizens and communities across B.C.

Consultation and coordination will, undoubtedly lead to stronger emergency management and disaster risk management. There certainly is a need for clarity on the disaster and emergency management response.|The Brooks home will never be like it was before the 2021 floods in British Columbia. Two years ago, extreme rain filled the Similkameen and Tulameen rivers. Water burst over the banks through a dike and flooded siblings Dian and Danies property just outside of Princeton. The two rushed to save their animals and waited for two days in the second level of their home before a rescue boat came. As Dian watched their homemade furniture bob in the deluge, she remembers thinking, There goes our house. There goes everything that we have worked for our lives. We have just lost everything. With help from volunteers, some funding from government and insurance they have since repaired some of the damage and are back inside. But the two pensioners are still waiting on the provincial government to respond to their appeals for more help. We have no money. As it is, were broke. We will be paying for this for the rest of our lives, Dian told The Narwhal. Southern B.C. was hit by its first atmospheric river of the season last week, a fitting backdrop as the province debates how to address emergencies and disasters. The proposed Emergency and Disaster Management Act will define how citizens and communities across B.C. are or are not supported by the government when disaster strikes, Chad Pacholik, a disaster risk manager told The Narwhal. The bill has seen years of engagement and delays and getting to the vote stage to implement the law could still take weeks, or longer. The provinces ombudsperson is also calling for urgent action to improve support for longterm evacuees after another summer of recordbreaking wildfires. The hope is this bill will help address decades of government inaction as climate change increases the number and severity of disasters faced by people across the province. But some experts in emergency management say key elements are missing that would ensure the legislation is clear, easy to implement, properly acknowledges First Nations and supports enough capacity within communities to implement changes. Quite literally, lives could depend on the framework and the law thats being discussed here today. Communities depend on us, as well, to get this right, Shirley Bond, BC United MLA for Prince GeorgeValemount, said last week in the legislature, as the proposal saw days of debate. Time is of the essence. Dian and Danie Brooks are still working on repairs after their home just outside of Princeton, B.C., was hit by floodwaters in November 2021. Photo Jen Osborne Bowinn Ma, minister of emergency management and climate readiness, introduced the act on Oct. 3. The 122page draft is a significant update from the previous 12page Emergency Program Act, which was last updated in the 1990s. It recognizes First Nations inherent rights, aims to address modern risks like COVID19 and climate change and acknowledges the importance of risk reduction, mitigation and preparedness along with response and recovery. There is also a clause that sets the act to be reviewed within five years. This legislation formally recognizes the rights of First Nations as decisionmakers in emergency management, Ma said as the bill was introduced. The Emergency and Disaster Management Act moves towards a holistic fourphase approach of mitigation, preparation, response and recovery. It requires climate risk assessments and updates the concept of what an emergency is, to reflect modern realities. Changes will hopefully prove to be a step in the right direction, Robert Phillips, First Nations Summit political executive said in a press release. The First Nationsled group supports nations in treaty negotiations. It will be imperative that this new legislation results in strong governmenttogovernment relationships with First Nations in all aspects of emergency management, premised on acknowledgement and respect for First Nations title and jurisdiction within their respective territories. Step in the right direction, but not far enough If done right, new legislation could help improve how displaced people are supported after major disasters, Tyrone McNeil, chair of the Emergency Planning Secretariat, Stl Tribal Council president and Tribal Chief, told The Narwhal. But as it stands, the current draft of the bill is disappointing. McNeil, a member of Seabird Island Band, wants to see evacuee programs modelled after the United Nations Sphere Project, a humanitarian aid program better designed to address longterm disaster displacement. The provinces current program is designed for an apartment building in Vancouver burning and people vacating for a week or two and they are rehomed, McNeil said. Indigenous people in B.C. are more likely to experience evacuations than nonIndigenous people, according to an analysis in The Tyee. In part, this is because colonizers forced First Nations onto reserves, governmentcreated tracts of land that are often in spots prone to risks and hazards and dont have enough protection, such as dikes to minimize flooding. The Indian Act also undermined the ability of First Nations to selfgovern and make decisions for the safety of their communities. Tyrone McNeil, Stl Tribal Council Chief and chair of the First Nations Emergency Planning Secretariat, pushed for more transparent consultation on the draft versions of the emergency preparedness bill before it was presented to legislature. Photo Jesse Winter The Narwhal The stress of evacuation, the stress of multiple evacuations by certain people is going to significantly impact their health over time, McNeil said. A humanitarian approach would also encompass spirituality, how to take care of Elders and dietary needs. Lets be proactive and lets invest early on. While the draft recognizes First Nations inherent right of selfgovernment and lawmaking in relation to emergency management, McNeil isnt satisfied. Its a prescriptive piece of legislation that doesnt fully incorporate our rightful place in emergency management, McNeil said. In particular, McNeil is concerned about clause 162 which says that, in cases of conflict, the Emergency and Disaster Management Act prevails over all other provincial acts and regulations. McNeil worries this clause could be interpreted to mean this act supersedes B.C.s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. Our rights and title are not properly placed and recognized and respected, in the current draft McNeil said. Community capacity is an issue Capacity is crucial as communities grapple with the growing frequency and intensity of disasters. That means having enough paid, trained professionals to handle everything from mitigation to recovery, providing access to standardized emergency management training, ensuring smaller municipalities and regional districts have enough funding and arent overly reliant on volunteers. Frontline delivery of emergency evacuee support is done overwhelmingly by volunteers, B.C.s ombudsperson Jay Chalke said at a press conference. His office reviewed the provinces response to the 2021 wildfires and atmospheric rivers. We heard about people who were working 15, 16, 17 hours a day, seven days a week for months on end as volunteers this model cannot be sustained. Most local governments are already having trouble meeting current requirements, disaster risk manager Pacholik told The Narwhal. The new legislation adds a lot more things to the plate, and we dont have a lot more trained, experienced people to be able to take on those tasks. Pacholik worked with local governments and Emergency Management B.C. when the legislation was still being developed and currently consults with First Nations and local governments to help them navigate disaster preparation, response and recovery. He said the new proposed act puts a lot more on local governments and First Nations, Pacholik said. I think theres going to be some struggles to try and keep up. Skwlx te Secwepemculecw lost a third of its structures in the Bush Creek East fire this summer. People in the area were forced out of their communities for weeks as wildland firefighters tried to get the wildfire under control. Photo Mike Graeme The Narwhal While its a positive step that the act puts a greater emphasis on consultation and coordination, some First Nations already lacking capacity will now have multiple entities approaching them to maintain this requirement, Pacholik said. Consultation and coordination will, undoubtedly lead to stronger emergency management and disaster risk management. But all takes time. The bill needs to enable First Nations to build capacity in a sustainable fashion, McNeil said. Hes called for government funding to be dispersed faster, more community access to professional support and incentives for people to take on advanced degrees and training. Pacholik said the act does strengthen some opportunities for collaboration it makes it easier for two or more local authorities or Indigenous government bodies to work together on certain requirements like preparing a risk assessment or emergency management plans. And overall, he thinks the bill is more inclusive and comprehensive than past legislation, Pacholik said. But while it has a stronger legal lens, he feels that many might struggle with the application of the bill if it becomes legislation in its current state. Its very aspirational language, that envisions a world where disaster riskreduction is prioritized and wellresourced and good relationships exist between all parties that need to work together. That is going to take some work in some areas of the province to get there. Language matters The draft is too complicated and should be put into plain language, emergency management professional Tarina Colledge said, so that it can be understood and applied by people who arent academics or policy experts. Reading through it sends you in circles as you follow various references to different sections and pages. In her 17 years of experience working on public safety with local government, Colledge has worked in British Columbia and Alberta and has been deployed to disasters in New Brunswick, Texas and Washington. Words matter and terminology needs to be consistent, Colledge told The Narwhal. The act, for example, doesnt define what a disaster is, instead referring to the old act for a definition. How can you have an emergency disaster management act that doesnt have disasters Colledge asked, adding that a clear definition is fundamentally necessary to ensure a clear understanding of what actions need to be taken when. Clear alerting systems are important to ensure people know when to prepare for a possible evacuation. Many alerting systems across the province require residents to optin to receive messages by text. Photo Mike Graeme The Narwhal Its a confusing oversight as there already is common terminology established by Public Safety Canada, Colledge said. The federal department defines an emergency as a present or imminent event that requires prompt coordination like a neighbourhood fire that is growing out of control. A disaster is when a phenomenon exceeds or overwhelms the communitys ability to cope such as a major wildfire requiring evacuation. Shes also concerned that the terms critical incident, incident, emergency and disaster are used interchangeably. Unclear definitions can lead to public safety issues down the road, Colledge said, because in a disaster, people on the frontlines need a common understanding to reduce miscommunication. It would be like changing the names of the tools in an operating room. Your gurney is not a gurney, your scalpel is not a scalpel. Opposition parties respond to proposed Emergency and Disaster Management Act During debate about the proposal, official opposition members from BC United said they were encouraged the government is acknowledging past issues but expressed concerns that this legislation falls short. There certainly is a need for clarity on the disaster and emergency management response. Im not convinced that this bill provides that clarity, MLA for West VancouverSea to Sky Jordan Sturdy said. The next step for the bill is a committee hearing where MLAs will ask questions, suggest changes and present a revised version for a vote. The House will then vote on the updated version and either send it back to committee for further changes or have further debate. A final vote by the members of the legislative assembly is needed before the bill is made into law. Bowinn Ma, minister of emergency management and climate readiness centre, met with emergency volunteers, fire chief, crews and evacuees this summer as wildfires hit Central Okanagan. Six firefighters were killed in the provinces recordbreaking wildfire season. Photo Province of British Columbia Flickr We have to really think about how do we get these big government machines to be more humanscaled, more oriented towards community and able to operate in a more effective and nimble way when there are real disasters that strike, Sonia Furstenau, leader of the B.C. Green Party, told The Narwhal. Furstenau said she is looking forward to discussing the bill further and finding out if local authorities and First Nations have enough capacity, resources and authority to drive significant change. McNeil is hopeful more changes will be made in the committee phase. He wants to see clear acknowledgement of Indigenous Rights, mechanisms for funding and language that encourages greater innovation and resilience. We really need to enable and support innovation, McNeil said. Particularly when it speaks to climate resilience and naturebased solutions, because those are the two longterm solutions on any disaster, whether it be floods, fires, tsunami, sealevel rise resilience is the best way forward. Alongside the legislation, the B.C. government is also creating an emergencies task force. This group is made up of 14 experts in emergency and wildfire management and will begin work immediately and provide actionoriented recommendations on enhancing emergency preparedness and response in advance of the 2024 wildfire season. Its past time While politicians debate legislation, flood survivors like Dian Brooks are still living in damaged homes, waiting for answers from government programs meant to help evacuees. After the 2021 atmospheric river events, she and her brother applied for funds through the provinces Disaster Financial Assistance program, which provides financial support to people who suffer sudden, unexpected and uninsurable losses as a result of an extreme weather event. Only disasters listed by the province are eligible. After months of navigating applications, assessments, site visits and paperwork, the Brookses received about 12,000 from their insurance, which the provinces program required them to spend before applying for any other assistance. They eventually received about 51,000 from Disaster Financial Assistance, far from what they say was needed. The siblings have since appealed the amount but still havent received a decision from the government. There is currently no required timeline for appeal decisions as of February 2023, Emergency Management BC received 182 appeal requests for the atmospheric river events and had completed just 12 requests. It upheld the original decision in all appeals. The same day disaster legislation was introduced this month, B.C.s ombudsperson Jay Chalke released a report detailing the failures in government response to the heat dome, wildfires and floods in 2021. It focused on the two main programs designated to help evacuees facing everything from an apartment fire to major wildfires and flooding Disaster Financial Assistance and Emergency Support Services and found that neither program has been adequately adapted as major disasters increase in frequency and intensity. The community of Merritt, B.C., had to evacuate as unprecedented amounts of rainfall triggered landslides and devastating flooding in November 2021. Approximately 7,000 people evacuated and many had to stay in hotels for months. Photo Ian Willms The Narwhal Chalke found the programs are outdated, underresourced, inaccessible and poorly communicated. His team surveyed almost 500 British Columbians affected by floods and fires. Many of them echoed Brooks experience of delays, bureaucracy, long waits and lack of clear communication. Chalke called on the government to take urgent action to better support people who are increasingly being displaced from their homes due to climaterelated disasters. Chalke also raised serious concerns about inequity in support delivery. The current onesizefitsall approach of these programs unfairly creates barriers for people to access the supports they need. The report detailed evacuees long waits for decisions about their aid requests, and described the governments communication as limited and confusing. It also criticized leaders for ignoring years of warnings, going back to 2003, that B.Cs systems were not set up for disasters that force people out of their homes for weeks or months. Successive leaders in government have, so far, failed to respond to clear direction for improvement in the provinces disaster response programs and capacities, reads the ombudspersons report. Brooks agreed the governments delay was unacceptable. Its past time, Brooks told The Narwhal. Past governments havent followed through on their promises because they dont have to. Thats the thing that bothers me. Theres money spent to make these reports and they get shelved. Nothing happens. The ombudsperson made 20 recommendations on how to improve the provinces Disaster Financial Assistance and Emergency Support Services. These include more capacity to handle applications, better recognition for frontline volunteers, accessible reception centres and flexible and responsive support for all evacuees. Chalke also called for a plan to help people facing longterm displacement, greater capacity building and funding for First Nations and a policy to reassess insurance availability across the province. Chalke also called for changes to be implemented over the next two years. At a press conference following the reports release, he acknowledged that new legislation could take years to see changes on the ground. What cant wait is a comprehensive plan to respond to people who are displaced from their homes for long periods, he said. Dian Brooks is grateful she and her brother, and all their animals, made it out of the 2021 floods alive. But there is still frustration with government inaction to protect their home from flooding, the slow response and ongoing recovery. Photo Jen Osborne Minister Ma told The Narwhal the province wasnt surprised by the recommendations and has accepted all of them. Weve already done a lot of work over the last few years to try to address or progress on addressing these concerns, Ma said. And there will still be work to do moving forward as well. The province is transitioning to an online registration system in an attempt to provide assistance faster it will send evacuees relief through etransfers, instead of requiring them to stand in line, fill out paperwork and wait for vouchers. There have also been changes to the Disaster Financial Assistance program to expand farm owner and small business eligibility. The new legislation speaks to our desire to no longer focus solely on response to emergencies, Ma told The Narwhal. We need to get ahead and be better at preparing for mitigating the impacts of disasters before they happen. The draft will evolve over the next few weeks as it makes its way through the legislative process. When implemented, it will still take years for related regulations to be developed. Brooks says she refuses to be defeated and is grateful that her brother and her as well as their animals made it out safely. But the todo list of repairs feels relentless from the roof, fencing, field repairs, front deck and walkway. We are not beggars at the gate. This is taxpayers money, Brooks said. She estimates they still have about 150,000 of work to go. Im angry at our government because I think that they have a very large part in this Theres stuff they can do about this. Theyre just not doing it. Editors note The ombudspersons report findings echo those in The Tyees Bracing for Disasters series, reported by Francesca Fionda in collaboration with the Climate Disaster Project. Both found people are being evacuated in B.C. for weeks, not just days, and government support has not adapted to the climate crisis.

AP A decade after they were first envisioned in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy s destruction, two of the largest flood control projects designed to protect the densely populated cities of New Jersey that lie just outside New York City finally got underway Wednesday. The projects will cost nearly 298 million and are designed to protect some of the regions most vulnerable communities. It calls for building 9,000 linear feet about 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers of flood walls, installation of flood gates and construction of berms and levees. Most of the work will be done in Hoboken, but parts will extend to protect areas of Jersey City and Weehawken, which also sit along the Hudson Riverfront across from Manhattan. And as big as they are, the two projects starting Wednesday pale in comparison to huge flood control efforts being contemplated by the federal government.|HOBOKEN, N.J. AP A decade after they were first envisioned in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy s destruction, two of the largest flood control projects designed to protect the densely populated cities of New Jersey that lie just outside New York City finally got underway Wednesday. A project in Hoboken, which was inundated by flooding during the 2012 storm, and another in the densely populated Meadowlands region, which also saw catastrophic flooding, kicked off. The projects will cost nearly 298 million and are designed to protect some of the regions most vulnerable communities. Both projects were formulated by the group Rebuild By Design, which was initiated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2013, and New Jersey environmental officials. Rebuild By Design looked at ways to reduce flood risk and increase resiliency in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, and it launched a series of projects that are in various phases of planning or construction. Eleven years ago, Superstorm Sandy pounded this community, said Shawn LaTourette, New Jerseys environmental protection commissioner. He noted that properties were under water for prolonged periods and there were deaths in the region attributable to the storm. That experience was a wakeup call in New Jersey that we need to invest more deeply to build our resilience to these risks, he said. Former Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, who was in office when Sandy hit on Oct. 29, 2012, said we realize how lucky we are that we have not had a major storm surge event in 11 years. Its not a matter of whether the next storm will hit, she said. Its a matter of when. RBD Hudson River is by far the larger of the two undertakings, costing 215 million. It calls for building 9,000 linear feet about 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers of flood walls, installation of flood gates and construction of berms and levees. Most of the work will be done in Hoboken, but parts will extend to protect areas of Jersey City and Weehawken, which also sit along the Hudson Riverfront across from Manhattan. Ravi Bhalla, the current Hoboken mayor, said that when the current project is completed in a few years, nearly 80 of the city will be protected by some form of storm barrier. The RBD Meadowlands project will add a highpower pumping station capable of moving 50 cubic feet 1.4 cubic meters of water per second in Little Ferry, a floodprone community along the Hackensack River. It also will add another new pumping station capable of moving 10 times that much water on a waterway in Carlstadt and Moonachie. Channel improvements also will be made there. Sandy hit the nations most populous metro area on Oct. 29, 2012. It swamped coastline communities, knocking out power, flooding transit systems and setting neighborhoods ablaze. Its blamed for 182 deaths, including 12 in New Jersey and 48 in New York, and caused tens of billions of dollars worth of damage, including 36.8 billion in New Jersey and 32.8 billion in New York. Chester cited numerous projects already completed in Hoboken as part of the postSandy floodproofing efforts. They include planting more grass, trees and vegetation in urban areas to absorb rainfall and allow less runoff to flood streets and storm sewers. Hoboken has already built three socalled resiliency parks in which green space is designed to absorb water, while runoff is collected in underground storage tanks and slowly released after a storm has passed. Amy Chester, managing director of Rebuild By Design, said recent heavy rains that caused massive flooding in New York City did not cause similar chaos in Hoboken, due in part to the resiliency work. And as big as they are, the two projects starting Wednesday pale in comparison to huge flood control efforts being contemplated by the federal government. They include a 52 billion plan to build movable barriers and gates across bays, rivers and other waterways in New York and New Jersey, and a 16 billion plan to address backbay flooding in New Jersey by building movable storm gates at inlets and across bays. Theres also discussion of elevating 19,000 buildings near waterways in many parts of the state. Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly known as Twitter, at httpstwitter.comWayneParryAC.

AP The debris and mud slide near the base of the road to the Okemo ski resort have long been cleared away, and open flags now hang outside shops and restaurants in a small Vermont ski town hit by severe flooding this summer. As winter approaches and the fall tourism season lingers, Ludlow businesses that lost out on summer tourism want to get the word out that they are open, even though some are still in the throes of rebuilding. As far as our businesses, Id say 90 plus have reopened, Ludlow Town Manager Brendan McNamara said. Some are still just coming down that final stretch to open, especially for the fallwinter season, but weve come a long way and town is ready for the winter season. Waiting with open arms. Ludlow was one of the Vermont communities hit hardest by the July flooding that not only inundated businesses and homes with floodwaters but heavily damaged the town post office and wastewater treatment plant. The post office reopened two weeks ago, though the towns flooddamaged grocery store remains closed. Businesses that were not physically damaged by the flooding suffered economic losses from the lack of visitors. Were open for business and ready to go, Mark Verespy, owner of The Killarney pub, said of the town. As far as the infrastructure goes, its there and were just kind of filling in a few small gaps, but they should be done for winter. Some think there wont be enough restaurants in town to meet winter demand, particularly if the grocery store doesnt reopen soon. The Shaws grocery store said in a statement that it plans to reopen as soon as possible but didnt say when that would be. For now, customers can shop online and pick up their orders in the store parking lot. The town hopes it reopens by December, McNamara said. Troy Caruso, who owns five restaurants and a golf course in town, lost Sams Steakhouse to flooding and is seeking a government buyout. He isnt sure yet what he will do with the flooddamaged Mr. Darcys Bar Burger next door, but if he rebuilds, it wont be ready for the winter season. His other three restaurants will definitely be open full tilt, he said, though business is down about 35. Its a little slow. I mean all the numbers are down. The restaurant numbers are down. The golf numbers are down. Everythings down, Caruso said. After the flooding, Okemo, which sits on higher ground, was able to reopen its bike park, summer camp and scenic lift rides in late July. Now its preparing for the winter season and plans to start snowmaking next month. Guests can feel confident that they will get the great ski and ride experience they have come to expect at Okemo, and we look forward to welcoming skiers and riders back this winter, Courtney DiFiore, a spokesman for Okemo, which is owned by Vail Resorts, said by email. After the floodwaters receded, community members showed up to help clean out Eight Oh Brew, a bar on the lower level of an old mill building. Even when it all happened, youd come down here, its dark, youre feet are in mud, were all working with headlamps, and really the community was great. Not even asking, theyd show up, said David Del Tufo, owner of the family business. People who come to the bar just came to help. He said the business has been caught up in red tape, waiting for a permit and guidelines for rebuilding. Its received some funding from the state and community as well as individual donations through a GoFundMe campaign whose donors his wife, Lisa Del Tufo, described as amazing. If they can find an electrician a challenge in a state that has a shortage of licensed electricians and plumbers exacerbated by the flood recovery David Del Tufo said they hope to reopen by midDecember. The drive from the community, they really want us back, he said. Were listening to them and were not going to give up just yet.|1

Residents of the northern Ontario city of Sault Ste. The citys mayor, Matthew Shoemaker, said Sault Ste. The Algoma District School Board said it was mourning the loss of three students in Sault Ste. Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste.|Residents of the northern Ontario city of Sault Ste. Residents of the northern Ontario city of Sault Ste. Marie were in shock Tuesday after what the mayor called an inexplicable outburst of violence that left five people including three children and a shooter dead and police investigating a case of intimate partner violence. Police said a shooter went to two homes on Monday night, gunning down multiple victims, before dying of a selfinflicted gunshot. The citys mayor, Matthew Shoemaker, said Sault Ste. Marie was trying to make sense of something that there is no making sense of. It is inexplicable that anybody could do this to loved ones, he told The Canadian Press in a phone interview. It is much more difficult to process and comprehend when it involves children. Police Chief Hugh Stevenson called what happened a tragic and unnecessary loss of life. The grief the families, friends and loved ones of the victims are facing is unimaginable, he wrote in a statement. As our community grieves this tragedy, I urge everyone to please watch out for each other. Police said the shootings were not random acts of violence and there was no ongoing risk to public safety. They also said they would not be releasing the names of the victims or the accused because it was an intimate partner violence case. Police were alerted to the shootings late Monday night, they said. Officers first discovered the body of a 41yearold, dead from a gunshot wound, around 1020 p.m. after someone called to report a breakandenter at a home, police said. The shooter appeared to have fled and about 10 minutes later, police received another call for someone with a weapon at a home about three kilometres north from the previous residence. Police said they found three children aged six, seven and 12 shot dead in that second home and a 45yearold who was injured with a gunshot wound. They said officers also found the 44yearold shooter, who appeared to have died after a selfinflicted gunshot wound. Tyson Jikinosky, who works at an auto repair shop in the neighbourhood, said there was still a visible police presence in the area on Tuesday morning. He said he learned of what happened by reading the news and that it came as a shock. Its a really, really, really ugly, ugly scenario, he said. I live a few blocks away. Its a pretty small town, so were all pretty close. The Algoma District School Board said it was mourning the loss of three students in Sault Ste. Marie. The entire Algoma District School Board community is heartbroken, the boards director of education, Lucia Reece, wrote in a statement. Counsellors and support staff have been put in place at schools impacted by this tragedy ... Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been affected. Shoemaker, the mayor, voiced hope that the community would support those suffering in the aftermath of the tragedy, especially relatives of the victims. We want the family of the victims to know that they can lean on their neighbours, they can lean on their community members, he said. I trust there will be results from this investigation that will likely spur change in our community and hopefully beyond, the mayor said. Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste. Marie was gutwrenching. This senseless loss of life has left family, friends and an entire community grieving, he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. All of Ontario mourns this tragedy. Police spokesman Lincoln Louttit said investigators had learned more about the shooter through witnesses who came forward. Its crucial to the community that we let them know that this tragic event had taken place. But we also need to make sure that the investigation can continue and as well protect other victims that are involved, Louttit said. Were not going to be providing any other details with the investigation at this point. Officers were at both homes on Tuesday, police said, and the investigation continues. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 24, 2023. Fakiha Baig, The Canadian Press|1

In a written report, The U.K.based Internet Watch Foundation urges governments and technology providers to act quickly before a flood of AIgenerated images of child sexual abuse overwhelms law enforcement investigators and vastly expands the pool of potential victims. Were not talking about the harm it might do, said Dan Sexton, the watchdog groups chief technology officer. This is happening right now and it needs to be addressed right now. In a firstofitskind case in South Korea, a man was sentenced in September to 2 12 years in prison for using artificial intelligence to create 360 virtual child abuse images, according to the Busan District Court in the countrys southeast. Story continues below advertisement In some cases, kids are using these tools on each other. At a school in southwestern Spain, police have been investigating teens alleged use of a phone app to make their fully dressed schoolmates appear nude in photos. The report exposes a dark side of the race to build generative AI systems that enable users to describe in words what they want to produce from emails to novel artwork or videos and have the system spit it out. If it isnt stopped, the flood of deepfake child sexual abuse images could bog investigators down trying to rescue children who turn out to be virtual characters. Perpetrators could also use the images to groom and coerce new victims. 200 Elon Musk says its important to have AI regulator as referee in tech space Sexton said IWF analysts discovered faces of famous children online as well as a massive demand for the creation of more images of children whove already been abused, possibly years ago. Story continues below advertisement Theyre taking existing real content and using that to create new content of these victims, he said. That is just incredibly shocking. Sexton said his charity organization, which is focused on combating online child sexual abuse, first began fielding reports about abusive AIgenerated imagery earlier this year. That led to an investigation into forums on the socalled dark web, a part of the internet hosted within an encrypted network and accessible only through tools that provide anonymity. What IWF analysts found were abusers sharing tips and marveling about how easy it was to turn their home computers into factories for generating sexually explicit images of children of all ages. Some are also trading and attempting to profit off such images that appear increasingly lifelike. What were starting to see is this explosion of content, Sexton said. While the IWFs report is meant to flag a growing problem more than offer prescriptions, it urges governments to strengthen laws to make it easier to combat AIgenerated abuse. It particularly targets the European Union, where theres a debate over surveillance measures that could automatically scan messaging apps for suspected images of child sexual abuse even if the images are not previously known to law enforcement. A big focus of the groups work is to prevent previous sex abuse victims from being abused again through the redistribution of their photos. Story continues below advertisement 422 ChatGPT, AI apps changing the way schools are teaching The report says technology providers could do more to make it harder for the products theyve built to be used in this way, though its complicated by the fact that some of the tools are hard to put back in the bottle. A crop of new AI imagegenerators was introduced last year and wowed the public with their ability to conjure up whimsical or photorealistic images on command. But most of them are not favored by producers of child sex abuse material because they contain mechanisms to block it. Technology providers that have closed AI models, with full control over how theyre trained and used for instance, OpenAIs imagegenerator DALLE appear to have been more successful at blocking misuse, Sexton said. By contrast, a tool favored by producers of child sex abuse imagery is the opensource Stable Diffusion, developed by Londonbased startup Stability AI. When Stable Diffusion burst onto the scene in the summer of 2022, a subset of users quickly learned how to use it to generate nudity and pornography. While most of that material depicted adults, it was often nonconsensual, such as when it was used to create celebrityinspired nude pictures. Story continues below advertisement Stability later rolled out new filters that block unsafe and inappropriate content, and a license to use Stabilitys software also comes with a ban on illegal uses. In a statement released Tuesday, the company said it strictly prohibits any misuse for illegal or immoral purposes across its platforms. We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes, the statement reads. Users can still access unfiltered older versions of Stable Diffusion, however, which are overwhelmingly the software of choice for people creating explicit content involving children, said David Thiel, chief technologist of the Stanford Internet Observatory, another watchdog group studying the problem. 221 Whats on your mind Singapore researchers use AI to scan brains You cant regulate what people are doing on their computers, in their bedrooms. Its not possible, Sexton added. So how do you get to the point where they cant use openly available software to create harmful content like this Story continues below advertisement Multiple countries, including the U.S. and U.K., have laws banning the production and possession of such images, but it remains to be seen how they will enforce them. The IWFs report is timed ahead of a global AI safety gathering next week hosted by the British government that will include highprofile attendees including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and tech leaders. While this report paints a bleak picture, I am optimistic, IWF CEO Susie Hargreaves said in a prepared written statement. She said it is important to communicate the realities of the problem to a wide audience because we need to have discussions about the darker side of this amazing technology.|1

Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste.|Residents of the northern Ontario city of Sault Ste. Residents of the northern Ontario city of Sault Ste. Marie were in shock Tuesday after what the mayor called an inexplicable outburst of violence that left five people including three children and a shooter dead and police investigating a case of intimate partner violence. Police said a shooter went to two homes on Monday night, gunning down multiple victims, before dying of a selfinflicted gunshot. The citys mayor, Matthew Shoemaker, said Sault Ste. Marie was trying to make sense of something that there is no making sense of. It is inexplicable that anybody could do this to loved ones, he told The Canadian Press in a phone interview. It is much more difficult to process and comprehend when it involves children. Police Chief Hugh Stevenson called what happened a tragic and unnecessary loss of life. The grief the families, friends and loved ones of the victims are facing is unimaginable, he wrote in a statement. As our community grieves this tragedy, I urge everyone to please watch out for each other. Police said the shootings were not random acts of violence and there was no ongoing risk to public safety. They also said they would not be releasing the names of the victims or the accused because it was an intimate partner violence case. Police were alerted to the shootings late Monday night, they said. Officers first discovered the body of a 41yearold, dead from a gunshot wound, around 1020 p.m. after someone called to report a breakandenter at a home, police said. The shooter appeared to have fled and about 10 minutes later, police received another call for someone with a weapon at a home about three kilometres north from the previous residence. Police said they found three children aged six, seven and 12 shot dead in that second home and a 45yearold who was injured with a gunshot wound. They said officers also found the 44yearold shooter, who appeared to have died after a selfinflicted gunshot wound. Tyson Jikinosky, who works at an auto repair shop in the neighbourhood, said there was still a visible police presence in the area on Tuesday morning. He said he learned of what happened by reading the news and that it came as a shock. Its a really, really, really ugly, ugly scenario, he said. I live a few blocks away. Its a pretty small town, so were all pretty close. The Algoma District School Board said it was mourning the loss of three students in Sault Ste. Marie. The entire Algoma District School Board community is heartbroken, the boards director of education, Lucia Reece, wrote in a statement. Counsellors and support staff have been put in place at schools impacted by this tragedy ... Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been affected. Shoemaker, the mayor, voiced hope that the community would support those suffering in the aftermath of the tragedy, especially relatives of the victims. We want the family of the victims to know that they can lean on their neighbours, they can lean on their community members, he said. I trust there will be results from this investigation that will likely spur change in our community and hopefully beyond, the mayor said. Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste. Marie was gutwrenching. This senseless loss of life has left family, friends and an entire community grieving, he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. All of Ontario mourns this tragedy. Police spokesman Lincoln Louttit said investigators had learned more about the shooter through witnesses who came forward. Its crucial to the community that we let them know that this tragic event had taken place. But we also need to make sure that the investigation can continue and as well protect other victims that are involved, Louttit said. Were not going to be providing any other details with the investigation at this point. Officers were at both homes on Tuesday, police said, and the investigation continues.

I was surprised by this news, said Joanna Kyriazis, the director of public affairs for the think tank Clean Energy Canada. The company went public in 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company SPAC, a brief trend during a midpandemic investment boom for cleantech and other sectors. That method is largely meant to give LiCycle a competitive advantage through convenient offtake arrangements with suppliers of used battery materials close to its many sites. However, while many spokes are already in place, the Rochester site is supposed to be the first hub.|Open this photo in gallery A worker sorts rechargeable batteries by hand during a tour of the LiCycle battery recycling facility in Kingston, Ont., on May 26.Lars HagbergThe Globe and Mail Sudden news of turmoil at a leading batteryrecycling company has rattled a Canadian cleantech sector that has hailed it as one of this countrys biggest recent success stories. LiCycle Corp. LICYN has grown from its roots in Kingston to open recycling facilities across the United States and in Europe, and seemingly positioned itself as a dominant force in the race to be ready for a flood of used lithiumion batteries from electric vehicles. But on Monday, citing escalating construction costs, LiCycle announced that it has paused work on a massive new plant in Rochester, N.Y., pending a comprehensive review of the goforward strategy for the project. The newly uncertain future of the Rochester facility which LiCycle chief executive officer Ajay Kochhar has previously described as pivotal to proving its business model and had said was on track to be operational by the end of this year had immediate repercussions. LiCycles share price on the New York Stock Exchange dropped by more than 45 per cent on Monday, to US1.23. On Tuesday it slid even further, closing at US1.07. Meanwhile, the situation was quickly seized upon by American media as a potential headache for President Joe Bidens administration, which has committed a US375million loan through the Department of Energy for the Rochester project. Capital costs for the project as a whole were initially projected to be approximately US475million. That has raised concerns about the situation being invoked by critics of Mr. Bidens broader programs to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build lowcarbon sectors. A spokesperson for LiCycle declined to offer further explanation for the change in plans or what comes next, promising that the company will provide an update when it reports its secondquarter financial results on Nov. 13. As industry insiders struggled to wrap their heads around the abrupt turn of events, a common initial take was that it broadly reflects supply chain challenges and a shifting financial landscape that have affected the viability of major lowcarbon investments as the world has emerged from the COVID19 pandemic. I was surprised by this news, said Joanna Kyriazis, the director of public affairs for the think tank Clean Energy Canada. But weve been hearing consistently from the cleanenergy sector that this highinflation, highinterestrate environment is pushing projects off course. LiCycle may be particularly vulnerable to those circumstances, during a highly ambitious and aggressive scaleup. The company went public in 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company SPAC, a brief trend during a midpandemic investment boom for cleantech and other sectors. An SPAC is a sort of shell company set up for the sole purpose of taking an existing company public, through a process that has subsequently been widely criticized for involving less accountability than an initial public offering, and in this case LiCycle was able to raise more than US600million through a 1.7billion valuation. That funding was used to advance a unique strategy to gain a large share of the nascent batteryrecycling market, which to this point has appeared to be successful. Whereas most other companies in that space are attempting to open a small number of large facilities which perform all facets of their recycling operations, LiCycle has gone with what it calls a hubandspoke approach. The premise is that a relatively large number of spokes facilities that break down used batteries into black mass, a substance which contains key component minerals lithium, nickel and cobalt are widely dispersed geographically. Those facilities are then supposed to send the black mass to a central hub, which would process it into batterygrade materials, which can be sold back into the battery supply chain. That method is largely meant to give LiCycle a competitive advantage through convenient offtake arrangements with suppliers of used battery materials close to its many sites. And so far that has seemed to pan out, with the company having beaten many competitors to establish relationships with an array of automakers and battery makers. However, while many spokes are already in place, the Rochester site is supposed to be the first hub. That side of the equation is needed for the company to eventually turn a profit by selling the valuable batterygrade materials rather than the black mass at a relatively low price to overseas recyclers as it mostly does now. And its supposed to be the model for other hubs, including one in Europe that LiCycle is jointly pursuing with the commodities giant Glencore PLC. Now, the uncertainty around commissioning that first hub has some experts questioning the entire sectors trajectory, given the way that LiCycle has thus far staked out its turf, with only the Nevadabased Redwood Materials generally seen as competing on the same level. LiCycle has chosen a highstakes strategy where they have been aiming for what could be described as a monopoly in the market, using the combination of distributed preprocessing and their Rochester plant to build barriers to entry for other players, said Hans Eric Melin, the managing director of the international consulting firm Circular Energy Storage. They have been extremely successful in attracting capital, which was unparalleled in the industry, he added. Whether this means that they have been flying too close to the sun is too early to tell, but escalating costs and a terrible performance for the share is obviously a bad combination.|1

By contrast, a tool favored by producers of child sex abuse imagery is the opensource Stable Diffusion, developed by Londonbased startup Stability AI. When Stable Diffusion burst onto the scene in the summer of 2022, a subset of users quickly learned how to use it to generate nudity and pornography. While most of that material depicted adults, it was often nonconsensual, such as when it was used to create celebrityinspired nude pictures. Stability later rolled out new filters that block unsafe and inappropriate content, and a license to use Stabilitys software comes with a ban on illegal uses. In a statement released Tuesday, the company said it strictly prohibits any misuse for illegal or immoral purposes across its platforms. We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes, the statement reads. Users can still access older versions of Stable Diffusion, however, which are overwhelmingly the software of choice for people creating explicit content involving children, said David Thiel, chief technologist of the Stanford Internet Observatory, another watchdog group studying the problem. The IWF report acknowledges the difficulty of trying to criminalize AI imagegenerating tools themselves, even those finetuned to produce abusive material. You cant regulate what people are doing on their computers, in their bedrooms. Its not possible, Sexton added. So how do you get to the point where they cant use openly available software to create harmful content like this Most AIgenerated child sexual abuse images would be considered illegal under existing laws in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere, but it remains to be seen whether law enforcement has the tools to combat them. A British police official said the report shows the impact already witnessed by officers working to identify victims. We are seeing children groomed, we are seeing perpetrators make their own imagery to their own specifications, we are seeing the production of AI imagery for commercial gain all of which normalizes the rape and abuse of real children, said a statement from Ian Critchley, child protection lead for the National Police Chiefs Council. The IWFs report is timed ahead of a global AI safety gathering next week hosted by the British government that will include highprofile attendees including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and tech leaders. While this report paints a bleak picture, I am optimistic, IWF CEO Susie Hargreaves said in a prepared written statement. She said it is important to communicate the realities of the problem to a wide audience because we need to have discussions about the darker side of this amazing technology.

CN rail trains are shown at a train yard in Vaughan, Ont., on Monday, June 20, 2022. THE CANADIAN PRESSNathan Denette MONTREAL Canadian National Railway Co. reported a drastic drop in profits for the three months ended Sept. 30, citing falling consumer demand, fallout from the B.C. port workers strike and a raft of forest fires and floods. Overstocked inventories and dockworkers 13day job action in July dented its cargo volumes and revenue, as did ravenous wildfires and floods at both ends of the country. Net income in CNs third quarter fell 24 per cent from a year earlier, the company said. It was tough operating out there in quarter three, Ed Harris, CNs chief operating officer, told investors on a conference call Tuesday. We started out by dealing with a twoweek port strike on the West Coast and then faced constant disruptions from forest fires and flooding until September, said Harris, whos set to step down from that role on Nov. 15. The countrys largest railway saw revenues in its biggest category container shipping drop by more than a third, due in part to consumers smaller postpandemic appetite for pricey products. I believe weve seen the bottom on volumes, CEO Tracy Robinson said, referring to container shipments. Nonetheless, she added that consumer activity continues to be murky amid an uncertain economic environment. What remains to be seen is exactly the strength of the economy returning. Container volumes at the B.C. ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert failed to recover in August after the previous months strike, dropping by 23 per cent and 59 per cent, respectively, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Walter Spracklin. That trend lingered into September. The Canadian West Coast port strike this summer prompted vessel operators to divert away from Canadian ports entirely, to other destinations such as Los Angeles and Lzaro Crdenas Mexicos largest seaport Spracklin said in an Oct. 13 note to analysts. In our view, the Canadian West Coast ports are at risk of having lost volumes longer term to U.S. and Mexican alternatives. CN chief marketing officer Doug MacDonald said the company is working to woo container customers back to Canadian ports and tracks following the costly shutdown of the countrys biggest sea trade gateway. We continue to see a hangover effect, he said. Depressed freight rates at trucking companies pose an added competitive challenge, executives said. Robinson sought to reassure analysts despite the sharp decline, noting that domestic container shipments as opposed to those bound for the U.S. enjoyed sustained demand. We think this is a temporary issue, the CEO said, acknowledging that any rampup in international container traffic from B.C. docks may be gradual. Weve lost a little confidence in the West Coast ports, she said. All five of CNs bulk categories, from coal to forest products, saw a revenue decrease except grain, which shot up 16 per cent on the back of a bumper wheat crop. Auto volumes also rose amid persistent demand following the supply chain backlog prompted by the COVID19 pandemic. Executives said CN continues to expect flat to slightly negative adjusted earnings this year, while forecasting growth of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent between 2024 and 2026. On Tuesday, the railroad operator reported net income in its third quarter fell to 1.11 billion from 1.46 billion in the same period a year earlier. Revenues decreased 12 per cent to 3.99 billion from 4.51 billion the year before, the Montrealbased company said. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings were down 21 per cent at 1.69 per share from 2.13 per share last year, slightly below analyst expectations of 1.72 per share, according to financial data firm Refinitiv.

Marie, Ont., on Oct. 24.Soo TodayAlex FloodThe Canadian Press Four people including three children were fatally shot across two locations in the Northern Ontario community of Sault Ste. Marie in an attack that police said was a case of intimate partner violence. The attacker also died of a selfinflicted gunshot wound during the attack late Monday night, while another adult was shot and taken to hospital. The mass killing, the provinces latest homicides believed to be carried out by an intimate partner, shocked the community of about 77,000 people located on the CanadaU.S. border, about a sevenhour drive northwest of Toronto. Police released almost no details about the victims genders or their relationship to the attacker, saying that information would not be shared publicly given the domestic nature of the crime. The Sault Ste. Marie Police Service said in an news release that officers responded at around 1020 p.m. to a call for a breakandenter at a home, then discovered a 41yearold shot and killed. About 10 minutes after that first report, a second 911 call came in for a shooting at another home located roughly a three kilometres drive away. When officers arrived at the second location, they found a 45yearold who had also been shot but was alive. Inside the home, they discovered the bodies of three children at the ages of 6, 7 and 12 as well as the body of the 44yearold shooter, who had suffered a selfinflicted wound. Crime scene tape remained up around the two homes on Tuesday evening. Sault Ste. Marie Police said Tuesday that because the case was the result of intimate partner violence, they were not releasing the names of the victims or suspect. They also did not release the genders of the victims or suspect. Police spokesperson Lincoln Louttit told The Canadian Press that investigators had learned more about the shooter through witnesses who came forward but declined to offer any further details. The police service did not respond to any additional questions about the killings. The grief the families, friends and loved ones of the victims are facing is unimaginable. Our hearts go out to them, police Chief Hugh Stevenson wrote in a statement. Mayor Matthew Shoemaker echoed those sentiments, calling it an unspeakable tragedy. There are no words to adequately address such a tremendous loss, he wrote in a statement. I extend our communitys collective condolences and support to the family and loved ones of the victims. ... We grieve with them as we try to reckon with this inconceivable act of violence. Ontario Premier Doug Ford called the news gutwrenching, and said the entire province mourns this senseless loss of life. Last summer, a jury at an inquest into a triplefemicide in rural Ontario made a series of recommendations to the government to prevent intimate partner violence and femicide. The first on the list was that the province should declare intimate partner violence an epidemic. The province has refused though dozens of municipalities across Ontario have since done so at the local level, and the federal government has also done so in official correspondence. The pervasiveness of intimate partner violence has been welldocumented. On average, a woman is killed by an intimate partner every six days in Canada. With attempted murders included, the figure becomes one almost every other day. According to the Ontario Association of Interval and Transition Houses, which puts out a monthly report tracking femicide cases in the province, there have been at least 46 femicide cases confirmed in Ontario so far this year, as of Sept. 30. Between 2018 and 2022, the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability has tracked 850 killings of women or girls. In 2022 alone, there were 184 a number that has been steadily increasing since before the COVID19 pandemic. Research into child homicides by the Canadian Domestic Homicide Prevention Initiative found that about 30 children are killed by a parent in Canada each year. Over the past decade, mothers have been responsible about 40 per cent of the time, and researchers found postpartum depression or mental illness often played a role. In 60 per cent of cases where fathers are the killers, researchers have usually found a history of domestic violence and retaliation against their partner after separation.|1

As a resident of the Kootenays and Past President of the BC Wildlife Federation BCWF I am supportive of Arrow Reservoir water level stabilization and Columbia salmon returning to BC which from the public commentary seems to be the First Nations and provinces primary ecosystem restoration priority. What the public has not been informed of to date is what is the quid pro quo Are there ecosystem costs elsewhere To achieve Arrow Reservoir level stabilization means foregoing some water storage which means it probably must be foundreplaced elsewhere unless BC Hydro is willing to forego power production which is unlikely. Reduction of water storage on the Arrow and options to replace it are questions I am certain BC Hydro can answer and should answer now, not after the fact. The public needs to know what is being given up to stabilize the Arrow Reservoir Unless a new dam is built water storage lost on the Arrow can only be made up from increased storage on Kinbasket Reservoir Mica Dam or possibly some on Revelstoke Reservoir, Duncan Reservoir or from Kootenay Lake. The answer is likely all of the above and this is concerning for residents of Kootenay Lake and possibly explains why BC Hydro continues to advocate dredging of Grohman Narrows for greater control of Kootenay Lake levels under the false guise of flood control. Recall we were promised in 1964 under the original Treaty that flood control was a certainty with construction of Duncan, Arrow and Libby Dams. A good journalist can dig up those promises of yesteryear. The relevant questions iswhat has changed that requires even further flood control on Kootenay Lake or is this requirement actually in anticipation of greater storage on the lake as part of CRT renegotiations My intention in writing this letter is to have a more fulsome public discussion about what Kathy Eichenberger and team are negotiating about our future waterways. Is Kootenay Lake about be abused yet again and if so how does this fit with socalled ecosystem restoration that is the third pillar of the Columbia Treaty renegotiation strategy Perhaps our local MLAs can inform us since the CRT negotiating team is subject to confidentiality and seemingly provides only selective, positive information.

I trust there will be results from this investigation that will likely spur change in our community and hopefully beyond, the mayor said. Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste. Marie was gutwrenching. This senseless loss of life has left family, friends and an entire community grieving, he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. All of Ontario mourns this tragedy. Police spokesman Lincoln Louttit said investigators had learned more about the shooter through witnesses who came forward. Its crucial to the community that we let them know that this tragic event had taken place. But we also need to make sure that the investigation can continue and as well protect other victims that are involved, Louttit said. Were not going to be providing any other details with the investigation at this point. Officers were at both homes on Tuesday, police said, and the investigation continues.

Nelson Bennett An abundance of natural gas will flood onto the global market in the form of liquefied natural gas LNG, starting in 2025, with Canada being among the countries contributing to a sudden surge, and with Russia being the biggest loser, according to the International Energy Agency IEA. In its newly published 2023 World Energy Outlook, the IEA predicts the demand for all three fossil fuels coal, oil and natural gas will peak in 2030, and then start to decline, with coal experiencing the sharpest declines, based on current stated policy scenarios STEPS. The share of coal, oil and natural gas in global energy supply stuck for decades around 80 per cent starts to edge downwards and reaches 73 per cent in the STEPS by 2030, the outlook forecasts. A sharp decline in coal demand will come from countries switching from coal power to renewables and other lower carbon fuels, including natural gas. But even natural gass days are numbered, the IEA predicts. The Golden Age of Gas, a term coined by the IEA in 2011, is nearing an end, the outlook declares. Global natural gas use has increased by an annual average of almost 2 per cent since 2011, but growth slows in the STEPS to less than 0.4 per year from now until 2030. Demand for coal to drop precipitously. The outlook shows Canada making an entrance on the world stage as sizeable LNG exporter in 2025. But once the first big bolus of Canadian LNG hits the world market mostly from the LNG Canada project in Kitimat future incremental increases of LNG exports from Canada are projected to be relatively small, compared to the U.S. and Qatar, which are expected to account for 60 per cent of the new volumes of LNG. Starting in 2025, an unprecedented surge in new LNG projects is set to tip the balance of markets and concerns about natural gas supply, the outlook states. Projects that have started construction or taken final investment decision are set to add 250 billion cubic metres per year of liquefaction capacity by 2030, equal to almost half of todays global LNG supply. Additions of LNG from countries like the U.S., Qatar, Canada and Australia may come at Russias expense. This additional LNG arrives at an uncertain moment for natural gas demand and creates major difficulties for Russias diversification strategy towards Asia, the outlook predicts. The strong increase in LNG production capacity eases prices and gas supply concerns, but comes to market at a time when global gas demand growth has slowed considerably since its golden age of the 2010s. The glut of LNG means there are very limited opportunities for Russia to secure additional markets. Russias share of internationally traded gas, which stood at 30 per cent in 2021, is halved by 2030 in the STEPS. U.S., Qatar account for 60 of new LNG volumes. IEA Russia is a major oil and natural gas producer. But after it invaded Ukraine, oil and natural gas markets were upended, triggering a major energy crisis, which had in fact been brewing in Europe before the war in Ukraine. Russia lost a massive European market for its natural gas overnight. The energy crisis it exacerbated has accelerated the move to renewables, conservation and various lower carbon forms of energy and transportation. A legacy of the global energy crisis may be to usher in the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era the momentum behind clean energy transitions is now sufficient for global demand for coal, oil and natural gas to all reach a high point before 2030 in the STEPS, the outlook states. In advanced economies, the rebound in natural gas demand seen in 2021 did not last long, and demand in 2022 was below prepandemic levels. This faltering in demand reflects a shift to renewables in electricity generation, the rise of heat pumps, and Europes accelerated move away from gas following the Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine. Just how much the global demand for coal, oil and natural gas will fall depends a great deal on China, which may no longer be the economic juggernaut it once was. If Chinas growth averages under four per cent per year between now and 2030, the IEA projects that Chinas total energy demand will start peaking the middle of this decade. To underscore just how important China is, in terms of global energy consumption, the IEA notes that a single one per cent decline in Chinas annual economic growth would reduce Chinese LNG imports by 20 per cent. If Chinas nearterm growth were to slow by another percentage point, this would reduce 2030 coal demand by an amount almost equal to the volume currently consumed by the whole of Europe, the IEA notes. Oil import volumes would decline by 5 per cent and LNG imports by more than 20 per cent, with major implications for global balances. The David Suzuki Foundation has seized on the IEAs latest forecast to suggest no more LNG projects should be built in B.C. The IEAs authoritative assessment proves, again, that LNG is the wrong choice at the wrong time, John Young, the foundations B.C. Energy Transition Strategist, said in a press release. Any new LNG projects in B.C. brought online or beginning exports after 2025 would likely end up as stranded assets. No new LNG supply is needed in a world rapidly shifting to renewable energy as the climate crisis intensifies. Global demand for gas is slowing down. B.C. missed the golden era of gas and projects that begin construction now are likely to become stranded assets. But despite its projections for fossil fuels peaking, the IEA outlook warns against halting all investment in fossil fuels. Continued investment in fossil fuels is essential in all of our scenarios, the outlook says. It is needed to meet increases in demand over the period to 2030 in the STEPS and to avoid a precipitous decline in supply that would far outstrip even the rapid declines in demand seen in the NZE net zero Scenario. The outlook also warns against overinvestment, however, depending on how rigorous governments are in meeting climate policy targets. Investment in oil and gas today is significantly higher than the amounts needed in the APS announced pledges scenario and almost double what is needed in the NZE Scenario. This creates the clear risk of locking in fossil fuel use and putting the 1.5 C goal out of reach. Nonetheless, simply cutting spending on oil and gas will not get the world on track for the NZE Scenario the key is to scale up investment in all aspects of a clean energy system to meet rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way. Both overinvestment and underinvestment in fossil fuels carry risks for secure and affordable energy transitions. nbennettbiv.com twitter.comnbennettbiv|1

Les pluies torrentielles qui sont tombes sur la province en juillet dernier ont mis mal plusieurs rsidences de Joliette. Alors quils sont parvenus rparer les dgts, plusieurs citoyens font face des factures ou des augmentations dassurance sales. Propritaire dun triplex sur la rue Manseau, Pascale Chouinard a vu son soussol se faire inonder par deux fois en moins dun an. Alors quelle stait remise des pluies qui se sont infiltres chez elle en septembre 2022, voil quelle a galement d faire face celles de juillet 2023. Ce nest pas juste une ou deux maisons, ce sont plusieurs dans tout Joliette , remarquetelle en ajoutant que de multiples voisins prs de son immeuble se sont retrouvs dans la mme situation. Les pluies de cette anne ont t exceptionnelles alors quHydro Mto annonait que plus de 100 mm taient tombs en trs peu de temps le 21 juillet sur Joliette et NotreDamedesPrairies. Leau qui a refoul ne semblait pas provenir des gouts, elle ntait pas sale. Par contre nous avons eu six pouces deau et nous avons d arracher le bas des murs et refaire le pltre , dplore Mme Chouinard. Cette dernire a observ quune part du refoulement provenait dun tuyau qui descendait du toit jusquau sol, dans les drains municipaux. Lizette Castonguay est, quant elle, propritaire dun btiment situ sur la rue du PrcieuxSang. Son soussol a dabord t inond en septembre 2022. a sentait mauvais, mais nous avons vacu leau tout de suite, se rappelle la dame. Le plancher a compltement t refait, comme le pltre et les plinthes. Puis, en juillet 2023, leau a de nouveau envahi le soussol en provenance de la toilette et de la douche. Nous avons nettoy de 14 h 18 h 30, mais les plinthes et le bas du mur venaient dtre changs Le quartier SainteThrse na pas t pargn non plus. Michel Marcotte tait prsent lors des inondations du 21 juillet 2023 et a russi viter le problme. Javais deux pompes qui fournissaient et je suis parvenu vacuer leau dans la rue. Cest parce que jtais l et que javais mes deux appareils que je nai pas t inond. Mes voisins, par contre, lont t , soutientil. Problmes dassurances Les inondations nont pas que laiss des squelles dans les maisons. Plusieurs rsidents se retrouvent maintenant avec des problmes au niveau de leurs assurances, certains ayant vu leur prime augmenter alors que dautres ne sont tout simplement plus couverts pour ce genre de sinistre. Pascale Chouinard a t protge contre les dgts occasionns en septembre 2022, mais lors du renouvellement de ses assurances, la propritaire a remarqu que la clause des inondations ne faisait plus partie de sa couverture. Lassurance a fait cela en disant que a se reproduira toujours tant que la Ville ne fait pas de changements , rapportetelle. Lizette Castonguay a, quant elle, sursaut en voyant le nouveau montant de ses primes dassurances. Mes paiements ont t augments de 500 . Alors, la deuxime inondation, je nai pas fait de dclaration , reconnaitelle. Elle a par la suite fait valuer les dgts et les rnovations compltes de sa tuyauterie sont estimes 40 000 . Pascale Chouinard a aussi t mise au courant des travaux coteux auxquels doivent se conformer certains de ses voisins. Ils ont dailleurs d payer des milliers de dollars en installations de clapets et autres quipements comme recommand par leurs assurances. Mme Chouinard avait ellemme apport des changements qui nont toutefois pas tenu le coup La dernire fois, au mois de juillet, les clapets ont explos Si a se reproduit chaque fois quil y a des pluies torrentielles, a ne marche pas. Michel Marcotte avait lui aussi fait des modifications pour rendre ses drains plus efficaces. Grce son expertise et aux pompes quil avait installes, leau a pu tre contenue, mais les paroles de son plombier sont restes graves dans sa mmoire. Il ma dit que mme si on met nos installations aux normes du code du btiment, a ne servira pas grandchose si le systme de la Ville ne fournit pas , se souvientil. Pour le coup, les rsidents impacts par les inondations avaient la possibilit de remplir un formulaire envoy par la Ville pour linformer des dgts occasionns. Avec des photos comme preuves lappui, la propritaire a envoy la documentation ncessaire Jai contact la Ville et on ma rpondu quelle ne prenait aucune responsabilit . Du ct de Mme Castonguay, elle na reu aucune rponse ce jour aprs avoir envoy son formulaire. Des actions imminentes Le conseil municipal de Joliette a t inform sur de multiples cas similaires concernant les inondations. En entrevue avec LAction, le maire, PierreLuc Bellerose, rappelle que les pluies survenues au cours de lanne taient exceptionnelles, mais il ajoute quil prend cur la problmatique et que des ides seront mijotes pour viter ce genre de situations lavenir. Le conseil veut revoir son plan directeur afin de savoir quels seront les investissements privilgier pour ne pas se retrouver dans une situation comme celles que nous avons vcues durant les dernires annes , indiquetil. Il explique que plusieurs rues du centreville et le chemin de la BasedeRoc ont subi des rnovations dans cette optique. Le quartier SainteThrse serait galement lun des secteurs prioriser. Les lus de Joliette rflchissent aussi la possibilit de mettre en place un programme qui aiderait les rsidents rendre leurs installations adquates Dans plusieurs cas, il ny a pas de clapets ou de drains conformes. Donc nous sommes voir ce qui pourrait tre fait pour accompagner les citoyens. Le maire souligne que la Ville investit chaque anne de 20 30 M pour la rfection de ses infrastructures et il assure que cet effort continuera. Nous allons voir pour le bonifier pour viter de nous retrouver dans une situation instable cause des changements climatiques. Pour nous, cest une priorit et dans le prochain budget, nous allons envoyer un signal clair ce sujet , assure M. Bellerose. Ce dernier informe en outre que lUnion des municipalits du Qubec avait fait une demande auprs du gouvernement pour des subventions de plusieurs milliards afin de contrer les effets des changements climatiques. Toutefois, aucun programme de ddommagements nexiste pour linstant, mis part des programmes de scurit publique, disponibles lorsquun cours deau cause des inondations. En terminant, le maire tenait apporter une nuance aux sujets de certaines rumeurs selon lesquelles la densification des quartiers de Joliette exerait une pression sur les installations. Tous les nouveaux secteurs viennent avec des bassins de rtention et des infrastructures qui font en sorte quon ne se trouvera pas avec cette problmatique , prcise PierreLuc Bellerose. En outre, le conseil municipal planifie la mise en place dune soire dinformation au cours des prochains mois afin dexpliquer les changements dsirs au plan directeur en plus des investissements prvus dans le futur budget.

Entre droit et politique, o en sommesnous Les changements climatiques rduisent des millions de personnes la famine. Ils dtruisent des espoirs, des possibilits de dveloppement, des foyers et des vies. Le futur dystopique est dj l, a dclar rcemment le hautcommissaire des Nations unies aux droits de lhomme. Il alertait alors sur les consquences bien relles de la crise climatique sur les flux migratoires. Confrontes aux rpercussions directes des changements climatiques scheresses, inondations, temptes, incendies, etc., mais aussi indirectes aggravation de la pauvret, inscurit alimentaire, pnuries deau et dautres ressources naturelles, certaines populations nont dautre choix que de quitter leur rgion ou leur pays. Le site Web des Nations unies nous apprend que, au cours de la dernire dcennie, les vnements climatiques extrmes ont entran en moyenne 21,5 millions de dplacements chaque anne, soit plus du double de ceux causs par les conflits et la violence. Ce phnomne actuel et croissant soulve plusieurs questions existetil un encadrement lgal pour ce type de dplacements Quels sont les recours des populations concernes Comment les gouvernements peuventils les aider Comment devrionsnous appeler ces migrations Comment les migrants sontils perus dans lopinion publique Tels sont les enjeux qutudie Sarah Munoz, doctorante au Dpartement de science politique de lUniversit de Montral sous la direction des professeurs Erick Lachapelle et Pascale Dufour. Une ralit mal dfinie Sarah Munoz Crdit Courtoisie lheure actuelle, les personnes forces de se dplacer en raison des perturbations climatiques ne sont pas reconnues comme rfugies, bien quelles migrent pour assurer leur scurit, leur sant, leur bientre et leur subsistance. Lappellation rfugi climatique nexiste pas au sens lgal du terme. Le statut de rfugi est protg dans le droit international et concerne des individus perscuts en raison de leurs opinions politiques, leur appartenance sociale, leur religion ou leur nationalit. Selon Sarah Munoz, si ltiquette rfugis nest pas exacte, les noms migrants ou dplacs sapprochent de la ralit. Mais le terme le plus juste devrait tre mobilits climatiques, puisquil prend davantage en compte la complexit du phnomne. Il existe plusieurs formes de mouvement limmobilit rester sur place malgr la vulnrabilit , la mobilit circulaire partir et revenir , la mobilit interne la plus frquente, soit partir pour une autre rgion et la mobilit internationale, cestdire traverser une frontire, explique la chercheuse. Dans lil du public Le vocabulaire utilis serait important, puisquil influence lopinion publique. Des tudes montrent quon ne serait pas empathique la cause des rfugis climatiques, puisquils ne sont pas oppresss par un rgime politique. En Allemagne, toutefois, la population considre que lEurope serait en partie responsable des changements climatiques, donc quil lui revient daider les pays qui en sont victimes, dcritelle. La chercheuse ajoute que lapprciation des rfugis ou des migrants climatiques varie selon les pays et les opinions politiques prexistantes sur les questions migratoires et les changements climatiques. Et ultimement, lopinion publique dteint sur la volont politique, premier vecteur permettant damliorer les conditions des populations vulnrables et leurs capacits dadaptation. Les politiques au cur des enjeux Pour Sarah Munoz, les mobilits climatiques dpendent largement du contexte politique. Dune part, les populations vulnrables se voient souvent contraintes de rester sur place malgr les risques quand les gouvernements affichent un ngationnisme climatique et ninvestissent que peu ou pas dans des politiques sociales et conomiques visant amliorer la rsilience durable. linverse, la mobilit semble facilite lorsque les tats ont des politiques qui accroissent la capacit des habitants sadapter aux changements climatiques. Par exemple, offrir de laide financire pour reloger les habitants dont les maisons perdent beaucoup de valeur, adapter les installations urbaines pour accueillir les populations dplaces, rflchir sur les questions identitaires concernant les populations autochtones pour qui le territoire est largement associ leur culture et leur mode de vie, indique la doctorante.|1

The Pacific storm had strengthened with shocking swiftness before slamming into the coast early Wednesday, and the Mexican government deployed around 10,000 troops to deal with the aftermath. But equipment to move tons of mud and fallen trees from the streets was slow in arriving. Resentment grew Thursday in impoverished neighborhoods as residents worried that government attention would go to repairing infrastructure for the citys economic engine of tourism rather than helping the neediest. Flora Contreras Santos, a housewife from a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the city, sought help in looking for a 3yearold girl who was swept away from her mother in a mudslide. She went from soldier to soldier trying to interest any one of them in the tragedy that occurred on her street at the height of the storm. The mountain came down on them. The mud took her from the mothers arms, Contreras said. We need help, the mother is in bad shape and we cant find the girl. Even as army bulldozers began clearing kneedeep mud from Acapulcos main boulevards, Contreras pleas did not appear to move any of the soldiers to action. President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador went by road Wednesday after the hurricane hit the iconic city on Mexico s Pacific coast. At least four people remained missing. It was unclear if the 3yearold girl was counted among them. The president said Otis had toppled every powerline pole in the zone where it hit on Wednesday, leaving much of the city of 1 million without electricity. Otis turned from mild to monster in record time, and scientists were struggling to figure out how and why they didnt see it coming. The people sheltered, protected themselves and thats why fortunately there werent more tragedies, loss of human life, Lpez Obrador said. Acapulcos municipal water system was down and around half a million homes lost power. Lpez Obrador said that restoring power was a top priority, but by Thursday evening there were still 300,000 homes and businesses with no electricity. Brown floodwaters extended for miles in some areas. Many residents were taking basic items from stores to survive. Others left with pricier goods, in widespread rampages through the areas stores. As cell phone signals began to return to some parts of the city, residents organized themselves with the help of friends and relatives living in other parts of Mexico and the United States. They joined together by neighborhood using online messaging platforms like WhatsApp. On Thursday there were some 1,000 people in 40 chats, which only continued to grow in number throughout the day. They shared photos of flooded neighborhoods and tips for finding cell phone signals, while asking for information about loved ones that they had not heard from. Others share photos of papers full of names of survivors taking refuge in shelters, some with notes reading Lupita, we are okay. I will call you when we have signal. When someone joins from a neighborhood theyre asked by people outside the city to look for other residents there. Juan Pablo Lpez, 26, had been talking to his wife when their call was cut off early Wednesday as Otis made landfall. She had returned to Acapulco to be with her family and give birth to their son a month ago. Lopez was at home in Cancun. Im very worried for my newborn son, he said. With no information coming in Wednesday, he created an online chat with friends and family from Guerrero state, where Acapulco is the largest city. He also invited friends who had emigrated to the U.S. and asked them to add their local contacts. We started to crossreference information, to share what we found, almost like a WhatApp newspaper, Lopez said. By Thursday afternoon, however, he still had not heard word about his wife and son. The surreal was commonplace in the stormwrecked city, as residents emptied the areas stores of goods. Ricardo Daz, a selfemployed laborer, stood Thursday with two fistfuls of live chickens he clutched by their legs. A chicken company had given him the chickens, Daz said. A woman nearby pushed an office chair loaded with artificial Christmas wreaths and toilet paper through the streets. Daz looked on in dismay as people carried armfuls of goods out of a damaged store. Theyre going to close these stores and that hurts Acapulco, Daz said. Edith Villanueva, holding her daughter, worried about what would happen to Acapulco in the long term. She worked at a cell phone store that had already been cleaned out. They already stole all of the phones, she said. Its one thing to steal food, but people are abusing it. Acapulcos police chief Enrique Vzquez Ramrez said Thursday they could do little to stop people from emptying local stores or speed up traffic caused by mud and fallen trees, which has left much of the city paralyzed. This is a completely extraordinary situation, he said. Some residents said it could take a year for Acapulco to recover with no power, gasoline, little cell coverage and hotels wrecked by the hurricane, the task seemed impossible. Marketing expert Antonio Esparza was one of the few optimistic ones, even as he sat trapped in the snarled traffic of the aftermath. This is going to improve Acapulco, because it will force the government to pay attention, he said. Large stores that had their merchandise taken were not restocking their shelves, meaning finding goods could become harder. But streetproduce vendors were doing a brisk business in some neighborhoods as residents sought fresh food. The oncesleek beachfront hotels in Acapulco looked like toothless, shattered hulks after the Category 5 storm blew out hundreds possibly thousands of windows. Miguel Angel Fong, president of the Mexican Hotel Association told the AP that 80 of the citys hotels were damaged. Hundreds of trucks from the government electricity company arrived in Acapulco on Wednesday but downed electricity lines were in feet of mud and water. It took nearly all day Wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting Acapulco to the state capital Chilpancingo and Mexico City. The vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. Acapulcos commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights, though Lpez Obrador said the plan was to establish an air bridge to move in resources. Acapulco is at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific Ocean. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, the port has in recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving away many international tourists.

While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage Acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late Wednesday experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast. Many of the once sleek beach fronthotels looked like toothless shattered hulks, after Hurricane Otis blew out hundreds and possibly thousands of hotel windows. Choked with mud and debris, with no electricity or internet service, the Pacific coast resort descended into chaos after the storm, as thousands engaged in massive looting. The hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by Wednesday afternoon, but left devastation in its wake. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. We laid down on the floor and some between beds, Sauczuk said. We prayed a lot. One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mess. He complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held, said Navarro. But there were some rooms where the wind blew out the windows and the doors. Navarro said authorities seemed to have been blindsided by the hurricanes rapid intensification. He stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mudchoked streets outside. This is out of control, he said. Acapulcos Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other lessflooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. While much of the city was in the dark and without phone service, some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK. Alicia Galindo, a 28yearold stylist in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potosi, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. Her parents and brother were staying in Acapulcos Hotel Princess for an international mining conference when Otis hit. They told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down ... until everything was gone, she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. However, Galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. Everybody is trying to find something out ... but no one knows anything, she said anxiously. The main highway into Acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of Wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. By late Wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced. Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside Acapulco on Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried shed lose them in the muck. The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay. Campos said. On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Researchers tracking the storm told The Associated Press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time when climate change has exacerbated devastating weather events like this one. Its one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when youre expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when youre not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, said Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been completely lost. Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the citys hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, Acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, Lopez Obrador said. Mexicos Secretary of National Defense told the AP on Wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that over 1,200 more were on their way. Officials also said they were working to restore power and phone service. Lopez Obrador noted that Otis was a stronger hurricane than Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people.

For the past 18 years, Kerri Dool has provided counselling services to residents of all ages. For nearly half that time, she has worked directly with students and young children in the Saults education system. While she recognizes this weeks incidents were incredibly violent, the support tactics her team members offer remains relatively the same. Any time we take a traumainformed approach to any crisis or serious incident, the guidelines are similar, Dool told SooToday. The most important thing to remember is the humanity in this, as well as the compassion and empathy we all need for those people who are struggling. Theres no linear movement through grief, she added. Its a process, and this is going to be a process of grieving that takes a very long time to overcome as a community. Realizing there are likely some parents in the community struggling to help their children cope with the tragedy, Dool says its important to check in with the little ones on a consistent basis. See what they already know about the tragedy, she suggested. Did the school share information Did they send a letter home that parents can reference with their children The grief counsellor noted that its okay to use direct language when talking about what happened this week, especially when the child is likely to hear about the devastating themes at school or in other places outside their household. Dont be afraid to say the children were killed. You dont have to be mysterious about what happened because I think your kids are going to hear that somewhere else anyway, she said. Its better to hear it in a safe environment where parents can provide support. During times of stress, Dool mentioned children may not function in the same capacity they normally do. But taking a trauma informed approach with them by lowering their fears and rationalizing their thoughts can go a long way, according to the experienced social worker. The fear response can become very heightened during a time like this, and you may even feel like theyre becoming paranoid of things that they didnt used to be aware of, she said. Asking them pointed questions like How often has your fear materialized in the past What are some things we can do to stay safe when you get worried about safety Those are ways we can help them switch over from that emotional response. Other tips Dool offered to parents include Have conversations about what intimate partner violence is and what healthy family relationships look like Use your own experience of death so kids know that we understand it Remind your children that its okay to cry and validate their emotions Reassure your kids by reviewing safety protocols your family may have in place at home Be aware of behavioural changes staying in their room, less socialization, not sleeping Model healthy coping as a parent, such as engaging in selfcare Check in with children on how theyre feeling physically butterflies in tummy, chest tightness, shortness of breath Take part in stressrelief exercises like deep breathing and meditation exercises on YouTube, Communicate with your childs support circle school, coaches, doctor, other parents In response to Mondays tragedy, Dool and her wellness team is offering a parent support group called Parenting Through Trauma. We really want to be there for our community right now, she said. We know that resources were stretched to begin with, and its hard for people to have access to services at times. We want to make sure people are resourced and supported. For families interested in the support group, or other options like parentdirect counselling and children and youth counselling, Dools team can be contacted by emailing email protected or by clicking here. Meanwhile, the Supportive Care Team at ARCH Hospice took to social media Wednesday afternoon to remind residents they also offer grief support for all ages. Our community has suffered immense loss within the last few months and this most recent tragedy has hit home for a lot of our community, their post stated. Please know that during this time, whatever you are feeling is okay. Grief is unique and very difficult to navigate. Be gentle with yourself and know that you are not alone. Grief Support at ARCH can be accessed by calling 7059421556 ext. 239 for children and youth Lana and ext. 242 for adults Laura. ARCH also offers online resources, and they are available by clicking here and here. Additionally, the nonprofit has a book titled The ABCs of Death for parents and caregivers on how to talk with children who may have questions about death, dying, or grief. ARCH will be hosting a series of workshops designed in coordination with the ABCs of Death book. The purpose of this workshop is to provide locals with practical tips and tools on how to Reflect on your own comfort with Death, Dying and Grief Talk to Children about Death and Dying Support a Child who is grieving Practice Self Care for the Caregiver The upcoming dates will be posted on ARCHs website for further information. Readers who would like a copy of the book can call Lana, or they can receive an ecopy by clicking here. Counselling services are also available for students attending Boreal French Immersion and Superior Heights, which the Algoma District School Board announced in a statement Wednesday afternoon. The school board has assigned a traumatic events response team at both schools to help classmates of the deceased and any children who are struggling with Mondays tragedy.|1

Each year, beaver wetlands like our Columbia Wetlands store about 470,000 tons of carbon globally.|Every year in the Kootenays we witness more extreme wildfires, floods and drought. It turns out that a brilliant little animal that we nearly hunted to extinction could play an important role in protecting our homes and the environment from these extreme weather events. Thats right not only are beavers brilliant ecosystem engineers that create habitat for countless other species, they also play a key role in adapting to our changing climate. Beavers reduce the impacts of wildfires, floods and drought Beavers rich wetlands are like sponges they store water during drought and make ecosystems less vulnerable to extreme weather changes. They also keep surrounding areas wet throughout so they dont readily burn, and instead act as firebreaks. Not only do beaver ponds resist wildfire, they also mitigate flooding by controlling and releasing water more gradually. They slow the water as it comes down the mountainsides, says ecologist Annette Lutterman, who has spent years researching beavers, particularly around her hometown of Golden. These dams often work in conjunction with one another. Near Kicking Horse Mountain Resort, one beaver complex has seventeen dams in a row along one stream Together, they allow raging spring snowmelt to be absorbed into the soil and surroundings rather than causing flooding. Communities that have suffered extreme flood events over the past few years are concerned about logging in upper parts of the watershed because it also increases flash flooding. Beaver infrastructure helps. Beavers create critical habitat for other species With only their bare paws and incisors, beavers shape freshwater habitat building wetlands and marshes that are incredibly rich in biodiversity. These beaverbuilt ecosystems create invaluable habitat for other species including fish, mammals, waterfowl, songbirds, amphibians and insects. Beavers have incredible foresight, ensuring their ponds have sufficient depth so as not to freeze to the bottom in winter so they can forage underwater for food all winter long. This depth also helps to regulate water temperatures during summer, which benefits other aquatic species, such as salmon, that could overheat in shallower waters. They are also big on excavating. Theyll dig canals going out from their pond so that when they forage for food, they can cut down a shrub and float it back to their lodge, rather than dragging it across the land. They prefer to float the food back because its easier, and theyre less vulnerable to predation. So they dig these canals, which are really important nursery areas for small fish, Annette explains. Beavers create healthier forests Not only is the water table higher in the forests surrounding beaver activity, but the microclimate is more humid which, in times of chronic drought, leads to healthier forests and ecosystems. Active beaver ponds also sequester an impressive amount of carbon. Each year, beaver wetlands like our Columbia Wetlands store about 470,000 tons of carbon globally. Not out of the woods Given how instrumental beavers are in protecting our landscapes and our homes its clear we should be doing our best to keep them around. North Americas beaver population has rebounded since protections were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its still estimated to be about 10 of what it was prior to colonization, and human activities continue to threaten beavers survival. One of the single biggest threats to beavers is trapping. Problem beavers are regularly killed for impacting human infrastructure. When beavers handiwork floods a road or property, a permit will often be issued to dispose of the animal and destroy its habitat. If they compromise industry by burrowing into the railbed within the wetlands or threatening a piece of road, for example CP or the Ministry of Transport will hire a trapper to get rid of them. Annette has tried to inquire as to how many permits are given out annually to kill beavers, but the government has refused to provide any information. Beavers are frequently trapped or killed illegally without permits as well, sometimes just to use the castoreum castor sacks, or their meat as bait for hunting. Hydroelectric dams pose another significant threat. Young beavers stay with their parents for about two years before venturing out to find habitat of their own, usually a few kilometres away. Theyll settle on what they think is a normal water body and try to establish a new lodge. But when water levels change quickly from water being let out of a dam or building up inside it the young beavers are wiped out. How can we help beavers help us Practices can and should be in place to mitigate beaver conflict. Research has shown that relocation can be effective when done properly. There are also beaver deceivers aka pond levellers which only allow beaver ponds to reach a certain depth, preventing flooding upstream. These contraptions trick beavers into thinking that no water is exiting their pond, simply because the flow is silent. They were developed based on an experiment done years ago to better understand where beavers instinctual desire to block water comes from. Scientists recorded the sound of running water on a cassette tape, played it on dry land near the stream overnight, and came back to find that the beavers had packed mud and sticks on top of it. Much is left to be done to protect beavers and their ecosystems here in BC. Weve got all kinds of mountain bike trails and new roads and infrastructure thats being built, and we have to figure out how we can adapt to that so beavers can come back, Annette says. As communities, we can anticipate locations where humanbeaver conflicts may arise and preemptively install levellers that both meet beavers needs and mitigate flood risk. If you happen to hear of a beaver conflict, inform people about positive alternatives to trapping or dam destruction. Suggest pond levellers or point them in the direction of helpful resources. Most importantly, share your knowledge tell your friends and family how invaluable beavers are, and explain how they help preserve landscapes and homes. Now more than ever, it is time we stopped working against beavers and started working with them.|1

While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage Acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late Wednesday experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels looked like toothless shattered hulks, after Hurricane Otis blew out hundreds and possibly thousands of hotel windows. This satellite image provided by NOAA on Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023, shows Hurricane Otis approaching Mexicos Pacific coast near Acapulco. Otis is forecast to make landfall early Wednesday and there is a hurricane warning in effect from Punta Maldonado to Zihuatanejo. NOAA via AP Choked with mud and debris, with no electricity or internet service, the Pacific coast resort descended into chaos after the storm, as thousands engaged in massive looting. The hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by Wednesday afternoon, but left devastation in its wake. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. We laid down on the floor and some between beds, Sauczuk said. We prayed a lot. One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mess. He complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held, said Navarro. But there were some rooms where the wind blew out the windows and the doors. Tourists sit on the beach in Acapulco, Mexico, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023. Hurricane Otis has strengthened from tropical storm to a major hurricane in a matter of hours as it approaches Mexicos southern Pacific coast where it was forecast to make landfall near the resort of Acapulco early Wednesday. AP PhotoBernardino Hernandez Navarro said authorities seemed to have been blindsided by the hurricanes rapid intensification. He stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mudchoked streets outside. This is out of control, he said. Acapulcos Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other lessflooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. While much of the city was in the dark and without phone service, some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK. Alicia Galindo, a 28yearold stylist in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potos, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. Her parents and brother were staying in Acapulcos Hotel Princess for an international mining conference when Otis hit. A tourist rides a horse at a beach in Acapulco, Mexico, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023.

AP PhotoBernardino Hernandez They told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down until everything was gone, she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. However, Galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. Everybody is trying to find something out but no one knows anything, she said anxiously. The main highway into Acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of Wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. By late Wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced. Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside Acapulco on Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried shed lose them in the muck. The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay. Campos said.

AP PhotoMarco Ugarte On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Researchers tracking the storm told The Associated Press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time when climate change has exacerbated devastating weather events like this one. Its one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when youre expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when youre not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, said Mexican President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been completely lost. Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the citys hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, Acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, Lpez Obrador said. Mexicos Secretary of National Defense told the AP on Wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that over 1,200 more were on their way. Officials also said they were working to restore power and phone service.

The 230kilometrelong Arrow Lakes Reservoir made up of Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake was created when the Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in 1968 under the treaty. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver. Speaking to West Kootenay residents with Conroy, Canadian treaty negotiator Stephen Gluck said while an ad hoc regime will give Canada more control over waterflow in theory, it also introduces uncertainty. The key is, Canada and B.C., we entered into this treaty willingly, as partners with the United States, Eichenberger said.|I would say that when it was negotiated in 1961 and entered into force in 1964, it probably was one of the most important if not the most important water treaties in the world, said Nigel Bankes, professor emeritus at the University of Calgarys Faculty of Law, whose expertise includes the Columbia River Treaty. Its significance was really that it provided for the cooperative development of the Columbia River the cooperative development of storage for flood control and power purposes, and for a sharing of the benefits associated with those developments. The treaty was forged after catastrophic flooding of the Columbia River in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, Ore., near Portland. It led to the creation of three dams in B.C. and a fourth in Montana in the Columbias drainage basin, serving both flood control and hydropower generation. But recent extreme weather such as this years severe drought in B.C. has exposed problems in the agreement that residents of the Columbia River Basin say need to be urgently addressed. The 230kilometrelong Arrow Lakes Reservoir made up of Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake was created when the Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in 1968 under the treaty. The reservoirs water level had fallen to 423.7 metres above sea level on Tuesday a low not reached in more than two decades. Nakusp resident Youmans said whats even more concerning is that its only October, and the lakes usually dont reach their lowest annual levels until late winter or early spring. I personally have never seen it this low, and Ive lived here for over 20 years, said Youmans, who is among 3,900 members of a Facebook group that wants to slow the flow of Arrow Lakes to the United States. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver. There are other commercial concerns. Nakusp Mayor Tom Zeleznik said low water levels had rendered parts of the reservoir unnavigable for vessels carrying logs, resulting in the closure of some businesses, and forcing reliance on costlier land transport. Katrine Conroy, the provincial minister on the Columbia River Treaty file and the MLA representing Kootenay West, said the province is legally obligated by the treaty to direct water to the United States for flood protection, powergeneration purposes, as well as for fish. Its really frustrating to be faced with a situation that feels like theres very little that you can do to fix it, Conroy said in an information session held for West Kootenay residents on Oct. 18, saying her position as the minister responsible for the treaty does not give her a seat at the negotiating table. The latest round of negotiations, which were the 19th since talks began in 2018, concluded in Portland on Oct. 13. My position doesnt give me a magic wand, Conroy said. I cant cancel a treaty or change its terms or requirements Often as a government minister, Im confronted by problems and issues that are hundreds of kilometres away, but for me, this one hits very, very close to home. Its in my backyard. Conroy is also B.C.s minister of finance. Federal, provincial and First Nations delegates are represented at the talks with U.S. authorities. If a new floodcontrol agreement isnt reached by September next year, the treaty currently calls for a shift to an ad hoc regime, with U.S. authorities having to rely on their own dams capacity for flood control before being able to call upon Canadian dams to hold back water as necessary. The concern, Bankes said, is that nobody knows exactly what an ad hoc regime will look like because it has never been done before. Currently, as I understand it, the dam operators start thinking about flood control operations in February, Bankes said. So, you need long leadups to be able to achieve target flows down in Washington and Oregon. That, I think, is the biggest issue, and obviously it should be a huge driver for the United States. What amazes me is that they havent got it figured out now, because 11 months is not a long time. The U.S. army Corps of Engineers, which built and operates the American treaty dam in Montana as well as a number of dams downriver in the Columbia River Basin such as the Bonneville Dam, warned Oregon and Washington residents in a September information session that waterflow may become unpredictable if Canada moves to an ad hoc regime. Development has proliferated on historical Columbia River flood plains in the United States since the treaty came into effect, and the Corps of Engineers said an ad hoc regime could lead to flooding and disruptions to transport corridors including the I5 bridge linking Oregon and Washington. At this point, we just simply dont know the actual changes in reservoir operations or potential changes in flooding, because we dont know how Canada will be operating their system, Geoff Van Epps, Commander of the U.S. army Corps of Engineers Northwest Division, told the information session. Speaking to West Kootenay residents with Conroy, Canadian treaty negotiator Stephen Gluck said while an ad hoc regime will give Canada more control over waterflow in theory, it also introduces uncertainty. I will say that even though we continue to negotiate, there is an emerging acceptance that a modernized treaty must include Canadian flexibility, Gluck said. Kathy Eichenberger, B.C.s lead negotiator, told residents the province received roughly 420 million last year in the Canadian entitlement from power generation at U.S. dams based on waterflows from Canada. Typically, the province receives about 150 million to 200 million a year, funding programs such as the Columbia Basin Trust that aids regions affected by the dams. Eichenberger said the dams also helped avert flooding in the B.C. communities of Trail and Castlegar in 2012. The key is, Canada and B.C., we entered into this treaty willingly, as partners with the United States, Eichenberger said. So, we are committed, as the U.S. is committed, to upholding to treaty requirements. For residents such as Youmans, however, it is beyond frustrating to see Washingtons Franklin D Roosevelt Lake downriver from the Canadian dams operating at normal water levels, while Arrow Lakes Reservoir recedes. Unfortunately, theres nothing we can do with whats happened now, Youmans said. All we can do is move forward and be heard on the upcoming and ongoing negotiations.

The center of Otis is expected to move farther inland over southern Mexico through Wednesday night. Otis had strengthened rapidly, going from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 12 hours Tuesday. Otis is stronger than Hurricane Pauline that hit Acapulco in 1997, Lpez said. Otis arrival came just days after Hurricane Norma struck the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula to the north.|Hurricane Otis slammed into Mexicos southern Pacific coast as a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane early Wednesday, bringing dangerous winds and heavy rain to Acapulco and surrounding towns, stirring memories of a 1997 storm that killed dozens of people. A strong Category 2 storm by Wednesday morning, the hurricane was expected to continue to weaken quickly in Guerrero states steep mountains. As dawn broke, authorities had given no preliminary damage assessments as much of the area remained without power. Downed trees, persistent rain and flooding made it difficult to move. The 5 to 10 inches 13 to 25 centimeters of rain forecast, with as much as 15 inches 38 centimeters possible in some areas, raised the threat of landslides and floods. Otis was about 60 miles 100 kilometers northnorthwest of Acapulco with its maximum sustained winds decreasing to 110 mph 175 kph and moving at 10 mph 17 kph. The center of Otis is expected to move farther inland over southern Mexico through Wednesday night. A long convoy of trucks from the national electric company moved through the Guerrero state capital Chilpancingo before dawn Wednesday toward Acapulco. Otis had strengthened rapidly, going from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 12 hours Tuesday. Residents of Guerreros coast scrambled to prepare, but the storms sudden intensity appeared to catch many off guard. Were on maximum alert, Acapulco Mayor Abelina Lpez said Tuesday night as she urged residents to hunker down at home or move to the citys shelters. Videos from hotel guests in Acapulco posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, as the storm came ashore showed blinding horizontal rain and howling winds. In one, white towels danced high above a hotels cavernous courtyard like sheets of paper and bed mattresses trembled on balconies, apparently an effort to blunt the storms winds. Another showed wind and rain howling unimpeded down hotel hallways. While in still another, a family huddled inside a hotel room shower to escape breaking windows and fierce wind. Otis is stronger than Hurricane Pauline that hit Acapulco in 1997, Lpez said. Pauline destroyed swaths of the city and killed more than 200 people. Hundreds of others were injured in flooding and mudslides. Between the internationally known resorts of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo are two dozen small towns and villages perched between the mountains and the ocean. Otis arrival came just days after Hurricane Norma struck the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula to the north. Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the citys hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. The city had opened two dozen shelters in the hours before Otis made landfall. Guerrero is one of Mexicos most impoverished and violent states. Just Monday, a local police chief and 12 police officers were massacred and found on a highway in El Papayo, which is in the Guerrero township of Coyuca de Benitez not far from Otis impact zone. In the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy continued moving northeastward over open water with winds of 100 mph 155 kph after sweeping through the Lesser Antilles over the weekend. Tammy was located about 540 miles 870 kilometers southsoutheast of Bermuda. The storm was expected to become a powerful extratropical cyclone by Thursday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

The goal of preparing for climate change is to achieve greater resilience such that people, neighbourhoods, businesses, and organizations can cope with current climate variability as well as adapt to future climate change, preserving the quality of life achieved through current development and minimizing damages. The climate is already changingPeople in Saskatoon are already experiencing the impacts of climate change.|What are the effects of climate change Over the next 80 years, global climate models project that Saskatoon can expect warmer overall temperatures more hot days changes in precipitation timing increasingly variable seasons more intense storms To learn about projected climate changes for Saskatoon and their possible effects, see the ClimateWest report A Snapshot of the Changing Prairie Climate April 2022. The effects of climate change are largely experienced at the community level and include public health implications, water supply and storm water issues, transportation system disruptions, power disruptions, impacts to public and private properties and landscapes, and increased andor urgent demand for social and emergency services. Consider Canadian disasters like the Calgary, AB flood in 2013, the western north American heat dome in 2021 that caused 11000year record high temperatures and forest fires and led to the destruction of Lytton BC, and multiple forest fires and evacuations across Canada over spring and summer 2023 these kinds of events are likely to occur more often due to climate change. How is the City preparing for climate change The City of Saskatoons Corporate Adaptation Strategy examines the impacts of climate change on our programs and services. A community adaptation strategy is planned for 2024 to address the risks to the whole community of Saskatoon. This table shows the highest corporate risks identified in the 2019 risk analysis The full risk analysis and the citys actions are set out in Local Actions Saskatoons Adaptation Strategy. While taking action to lower our emissions, the City is also proactively preparing itself to face climate impacts and mitigate risks to key infrastructure, programs and services posed by a warming climate and more frequent and intense storms. For instance, we have added a dry pond to the Churchill Park as a way to improve flood control. The goal of preparing for climate change is to achieve greater resilience such that people, neighbourhoods, businesses, and organizations can cope with current climate variability as well as adapt to future climate change, preserving the quality of life achieved through current development and minimizing damages. The climate is already changing People in Saskatoon are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. According to Climate West and the Prairie Climate Centre, the Prairies are warming faster than in the rest of Canada and the rest of the world. As Saskatoons climate continues to change, according to Climate West and Prairie Climate Centre we can expect More severe and more frequent storms Unpredictable rainfall increased drought in the summer and increased flooding as more of our rain falls in heavy storms More days with poor air quality as wildfires increase across Canada Weather whiplash increased sudden changes between hot and cold days, such as a rainy February day followed by extreme cold More very hot days in summer. Saskatoon is projected to move from 14 days above 30C every year historically to 28 days above 30C in the next 20 years and 47 days by 2060 Climate change will affect our daytoday lives and increase costs for people living in Saskatoon. Some of the impacts include Damage to roads and buildings from floods, storms, and temperature swings Increased demand for water and power systems could result in water restrictions or power outages Increased costs to cool homes and businesses in the summer Increased costs of insurance as storm and flood damage become more common Loss of trees from increased pests and droughts Changes to our outdoor recreation. This might mean longer summers for outdoor recreation, but also more days in the summer with extreme heat or poor air quality limiting how we spend time outdoors Increased heatrelated illness, respiratory problems from wildfire smoke, and new diseases moving north as the climate warms There are some potential benefits if we adapt and prepare for climate change, but those benefits could be outweighed by new challenges Longer growing seasons, but the benefits may be outweighed increased drought and storms Longer warm season for outdoor recreation, but the number of summer days with smoke and extreme heat will also increase, so we may have fewer days enjoying the outdoors Fewer winter days below 30, but with an increase in rain on snow, icy conditions, and winter storms The farming sector could see benefits from being able to grow different, potentially more valuable, crops but will also face increased pests and diseases, increased drought, and more frequent and severe storms including high winds and hail References and Resources|1

I would like to thank our Environment Agency teams and first responders, with 62,000 properties already protected thanks to our flood defences. Our Property Flood Resilience Repair Grant Scheme will soon be open to help residents better protect their property in the future, giving some peace of mind as they rebuild and repair. Story continues Ms Coffey was criticised earlier this week during a visit to floodhit Retford in Nottinghamshire, with residents saying she went to polish her halo. Victims said the area floods annually but never as bad as this year and that the Government should have done more to protect people before the storm. The Government said it protected nearly 50,000 homes and is putting 5.2 billion into further defences. Ms Coffey told MPs on Tuesday that the storm was harder to predict because it came from the east instead of from the Atlantic, as is more usual. Scientists have said attributing individual extreme rainfall events like Storm Babet to climate change is much more difficult than with heatwaves, but it is generally understood that the warming atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to more intense rain storms. Every degree of warming adds 7 more water to clouds, with the extreme rain affecting northern Scotland more than anywhere else in the UK. The Met Office predicts a quadrupling of extreme rainfall events by 2080 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curtailed, though this rises to a 10fold increase for northwest Scotland.|1

AP A decade after they were first envisioned in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy s destruction, two of the largest flood control projects designed to protect the densely populated cities of New Jersey that lie just outside New York City finally got underway Wednesday. The projects will cost nearly 298 million and are designed to protect some of the regions most vulnerable communities. It calls for building 9,000 linear feet about 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers of flood walls, installation of flood gates and construction of berms and levees. Most of the work will be done in Hoboken, but parts will extend to protect areas of Jersey City and Weehawken, which also sit along the Hudson Riverfront across from Manhattan. And as big as they are, the two projects starting Wednesday pale in comparison to huge flood control efforts being contemplated by the federal government.|HOBOKEN, N.J. AP A decade after they were first envisioned in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy s destruction, two of the largest flood control projects designed to protect the densely populated cities of New Jersey that lie just outside New York City finally got underway Wednesday. A project in Hoboken, which was inundated by flooding during the 2012 storm, and another in the densely populated Meadowlands region, which also saw catastrophic flooding, kicked off. The projects will cost nearly 298 million and are designed to protect some of the regions most vulnerable communities. Both projects were formulated by the group Rebuild By Design, which was initiated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2013, and New Jersey environmental officials. Rebuild By Design looked at ways to reduce flood risk and increase resiliency in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, and it launched a series of projects that are in various phases of planning or construction. Eleven years ago, Superstorm Sandy pounded this community, said Shawn LaTourette, New Jerseys environmental protection commissioner. He noted that properties were under water for prolonged periods and there were deaths in the region attributable to the storm. That experience was a wakeup call in New Jersey that we need to invest more deeply to build our resilience to these risks, he said. Former Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, who was in office when Sandy hit on Oct. 29, 2012, said we realize how lucky we are that we have not had a major storm surge event in 11 years. Its not a matter of whether the next storm will hit, she said. Its a matter of when. RBD Hudson River is by far the larger of the two undertakings, costing 215 million. It calls for building 9,000 linear feet about 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers of flood walls, installation of flood gates and construction of berms and levees. Most of the work will be done in Hoboken, but parts will extend to protect areas of Jersey City and Weehawken, which also sit along the Hudson Riverfront across from Manhattan. Story continues Ravi Bhalla, the current Hoboken mayor, said that when the current project is completed in a few years, nearly 80 of the city will be protected by some form of storm barrier. The RBD Meadowlands project will add a highpower pumping station capable of moving 50 cubic feet 1.4 cubic meters of water per second in Little Ferry, a floodprone community along the Hackensack River. It also will add another new pumping station capable of moving 10 times that much water on a waterway in Carlstadt and Moonachie. Channel improvements also will be made there. Sandy hit the nations most populous metro area on Oct. 29, 2012. It swamped coastline communities, knocking out power, flooding transit systems and setting neighborhoods ablaze. Its blamed for 182 deaths, including 12 in New Jersey and 48 in New York, and caused tens of billions of dollars worth of damage, including 36.8 billion in New Jersey and 32.8 billion in New York. Chester cited numerous projects already completed in Hoboken as part of the postSandy floodproofing efforts. They include planting more grass, trees and vegetation in urban areas to absorb rainfall and allow less runoff to flood streets and storm sewers. Hoboken has already built three socalled resiliency parks in which green space is designed to absorb water, while runoff is collected in underground storage tanks and slowly released after a storm has passed. Amy Chester, managing director of Rebuild By Design, said recent heavy rains that caused massive flooding in New York City did not cause similar chaos in Hoboken, due in part to the resiliency work. And as big as they are, the two projects starting Wednesday pale in comparison to huge flood control efforts being contemplated by the federal government. They include a 52 billion plan to build movable barriers and gates across bays, rivers and other waterways in New York and New Jersey, and a 16 billion plan to address backbay flooding in New Jersey by building movable storm gates at inlets and across bays. Theres also discussion of elevating 19,000 buildings near waterways in many parts of the state. Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly known as Twitter, at httpstwitter.comWayneParryAC.

The early images and accounts were of extensive devastation, toppled trees and power lines lying in brown floodwaters that in some areas extended for miles. The resulting destruction delayed a comprehensive response by the government, which was still assessing the damage along Mexicos Pacific coast, and made residents desperate. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels in Acapulco looked like toothless, shattered hulks a day after the Category5 storm blew out hundreds and possibly thousands of windows. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. There seemed to be a widespread frustration with authorities. While some 10,000 military troops were deployed to the area, they lacked the tools to clean tons of mud and fallen trees from the streets. Hundreds of trucks from the government electricity company arrived in Acapulco early Wednesday, but seemed at a loss as to how to restore power, with downed electricity lines lying in feet of mud and water. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. We laid down on the floor, and some between beds, Sauczuk said. We prayed a lot. One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mass. Sauczuk complained that his group was given no warning, nor was offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he would die in his 13thstorey hotel room. I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held, said Navarro. But there were some room where the wind blew out the windows and the doors. Navarro stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flatscreen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts on to the mudchoked streets outside. OUT OF CONTROL This is out of control, he said. Isabel de la Cruz, a resident of Acapulco, tried to move a shopping cart loaded with diapers, instant noodles and toilet paper through the mud. She viewed what she took as a chance to help her family after she lost the tin roof of her home and her familys important documents in the hurricane. When is the government ever going to look after the common people she said. Inside one store, National Guard officers allowed looters to take perishable items like food, but made futile efforts to prevent people from taking appliances, even as people outside loaded refrigerators on top of taxis. It took nearly all day Wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting Acapulco to the state capital Chilpancingo and Mexico City. The vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. Acapulcos commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights. Acapulcos Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other lessflooded streets soldiers shovelled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. Wednesday night the city plunged into darkness. There was no phone service, but some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK.|1

Meanwhile the Met Office has extended its latest warning of heavy rain over the area by a further 24 hours, meaning it will be in place over much of the weekend. The latest yellow weather warning for rain covers Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dundee, and Perth and Kinross most of which saw prolonged downpours cause problems for residents last week, including flooding. The warning was originally to run from 12pm on Thursday to 12pm on Saturday. It will now remain in place until 12pm on Sunday. PA Graphics Seven people are known to have died in the UK during Storm Babet, including three people north of the border. They were Wendy Taylor, 57, of Perthshire John Gillan, 56, of Arbroath and Peter Pelling, 61, also of Arbroath. Brechin in Angus was the worst affected area in northeast Scotland, and hundreds of homes had to be evacuated after the river South Esk breached its banks. The Met Office said on Wednesday An area of low pressure becomes firmly in charge over the next few days to bring plenty of showers and further rainfall, especially to parts of eastern Scotland. Members of the emergency services had to help residents to safety in Brechin last week during Storm Babet PA The latest Scottish Flood Forecast update, issued by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency Sepa said Significant flooding impacts from rivers and surface water on Thursday, Friday and Saturday are likely in the north east. There is also a risk of further impacts in areas recovering from recent flooding. River levels are not expected to be as high as experienced during Storm Babet but as the rain will be falling onto already wet ground, flooding from surface water runoff may also cause impacts. Caithness and Sutherland, Easter Ross and Great Glen and the south west of Scotland may also experience some localised flooding due to persistent and heavy rain. Elsewhere, Network Rail Scotland warned More extremely heavy rain is on the way. It wont be to the levels from Storm Babet, but it will affect the same areas, already with saturated ground.

Maries historic lighted cross is illuminated at dusk Wednesday as police hold the scene of a tragic intimate partner violence killing on Tancred Street. Kenneth ArmstrongSooToday 1 1 Sault Ste. Maries historic lighted cross is illuminated at dusk Wednesday as police hold the scene of a tragic intimate partner violence killing on Tancred Street. Kenneth ArmstrongSooToday Advertisement A longtime social worker in Sault Ste. Marie is offering direction for families who may be struggling to help their kids cope with Monday nights shootings that claimed five lives, including three children aged 6, 7, and twelve. For the past 18 years, Kerri Dool has provided counselling services to residents of all ages. For nearly half that time, she has worked directly with students and young children in the Saults education system. While she recognizes this weeks incidents were incredibly violent, the support tactics her team members offer remains relatively the same. Any time we take a traumainformed approach to any crisis or serious incident, the guidelines are similar, Dool told SooToday. The most important thing to remember is the humanity in this, as well as the compassion and empathy we all need for those people who are struggling. Theres no linear movement through grief, she added. Its a process, and this is going to be a process of grieving that takes a very long time to overcome as a community. Realizing there are likely some parents in the community struggling to help their children cope with the tragedy, Dool says its important to check in with the little ones on a consistent basis. See what they already know about the tragedy, she suggested. Did the school share information Did they send a letter home that parents can reference with their children The grief counsellor noted that its okay to use direct language when talking about what happened this week, especially when the child is likely to hear about the devastating themes at school or in other places outside their household. Dont be afraid to say the children were killed. You dont have to be mysterious about what happened because I think your kids are going to hear that somewhere else anyway, she said. Its better to hear it in a safe environment where parents can provide support. During times of stress, Dool mentioned children may not function in the same capacity they normally do. But taking a trauma informed approach with them by lowering their fears and rationalizing their thoughts can go a long way, according to the experienced social worker. The fear response can become very heightened during a time like this, and you may even feel like theyre becoming paranoid of things that they didnt used to be aware of, she said. Asking them pointed questions like How often has your fear materialized in the past What are some things we can do to stay safe when you get worried about safety Those are ways we can help them switch over from that emotional response. Other tips Dool offered to parents include Have conversations about what intimate partner violence is and what healthy family relationships look like Use your own experience of death so kids know that we understand it Remind your children that its okay to cry and validate their emotions Reassure your kids by reviewing safety protocols your family may have in place at home Be aware of behavioural changes staying in their room, less socialization, not sleeping Model healthy coping as a parent, such as engaging in selfcare Check in with children on how theyre feeling physically butterflies in tummy, chest tightness, shortness of breath Take part in stressrelief exercises like deep breathing and meditation exercises on YouTube, Communicate with your childs support circle school, coaches, doctor, other parents In response to Mondays tragedy, Dool and her wellness team is offering a parent support group called Parenting Through Trauma. We really want to be there for our community right now, she said. We know that resources were stretched to begin with, and its hard for people to have access to services at times. We want to make sure people are resourced and supported. For families interested in the support group, or other options like parentdirect counselling and children and youth counselling, Dools team can be contacted by emailing email protected or by clicking here. Meanwhile, the Supportive Care Team at ARCH Hospice took to social media Wednesday afternoon to remind residents they also offer grief support for all ages. Our community has suffered immense loss within the last few months and this most recent tragedy has hit home for a lot of our community, their post stated. Please know that during this time, whatever you are feeling is okay. Grief is unique and very difficult to navigate. Be gentle with yourself and know that you are not alone. Grief Support at ARCH can be accessed by calling 7059421556 ext. 239 for children and youth Lana and ext. 242 for adults Laura. ARCH also offers online resources, and they are available by clicking here and here. Additionally, the nonprofit has a book titled The ABCs of Death for parents and caregivers on how to talk with children who may have questions about death, dying, or grief. ARCH will be hosting a series of workshops designed in coordination with the ABCs of Death book. The purpose of this workshop is to provide locals with practical tips and tools on how to Reflect on your own comfort with Death, Dying and Grief Talk to Children about Death and Dying Support a Child who is grieving Practice Self Care for the Caregiver The upcoming dates will be posted on ARCHs website for further information.

Broussard said the creation of a new sevenunit housing development next door has led to flooding and other damage on her Hammonds Plains, N.S., property, so shes taking the developer to small claims court. Weve lost a lot because of this development, Broussard said in an interview. We have nobody, nobody to advocate for us. Broussard says she is not happy with how the neighbouring sevenunit housing development has damaged her land, so she is taking the developer to small claims court. Robert ShortCBC The issues started last summer, she said, when trees and a thick stand of bushes along the side of her front lawn were removed, revealing a view of the back decks on the new condos at 85 Pockwock Road. Over the next few months, Broussard regularly contacted the Halifax Regional Municipality about issues she saw the missing bushes, a gravel driveway the developer built on her land, as well as decks and awnings that encroached on the property line. Construction equipment is seen working on the sevenunit condominium development by Benmark at 85 Pockwock Rd., right, sometime in late 2022. The small wooden stake in the foreground marks the property line for Broussards property. Tammy Broussard She said city staff eventually told the developer to shorten the decks and awnings, which they did. But Broussard said she wasnt happy with overall communication from the municipality. Broussard said staff told her the issue was a civil one between neighbours, and she could also contact police. She made a complaint to RCMP in June, but the Mounties told CBC News the matter was a civil land dispute so the investigation was closed. The biggest issue was flooding. Broussard said the developer raised the grade of their property and filled in a longstanding stormwater trench that ran behind both properties, creating a dam. We havent been able to utilize our backyard for the better part of well, two summers, she said. In April, Broussard said she had a meeting with two Halifax staff members and two of the developments contractors. They told her they planned to install a drainage system to handle water collecting along the property line between the buildings, and that she could choose what trees and shrubs would be replanted on her land to fix the damage. Broussard said while the drainage system works well, it was placed under her property and she doesnt want the responsibility of maintaining it. Flooding in Broussards backyard from February 2023. Tammy Broussard Just before historic flooding hit the province in July, she called the provincial Department of Environment and Climate Change to inspect her property. The resulting report from environmental officer Anthony Heggelin said that on July 13, he saw water up over the fire pit area as well as debris like leaves and tree needles further up the lawn marking where previous flooding had reached.

Google Although Broussard said they offered to sell the developer the strip of land between their properties, they declined. So, Broussard said there was no other avenue but to file a lawsuit in small claims court for 25,000 to cover some of the damages. Were going to be hard pressed to find anybody who would even want to stay here to rent the place even, let alone buy it, Broussard said. You know, your home and your property are your biggest assets. Developer responds Ontariobased Benmark Residential Investments is building the row of condos. Mark May and Benjamin May are listed as the company directors. In a statement via their lawyer Will Brien of Cox and Palmer, Benmark said they have acted in a respectful manner within the neighbourhood and operated under the full oversight of HRM for the building and grading of the development. Benmark acknowledged they inadvertently damaged a small patch of grass and shrubbery on Broussards property, and allowed a short piece of pipe to be placed partially onto her land as part of the drainage system. Benmark has made several offers to remediate and fix this damage to ensure that the Broussards property is fully repaired to its original state and that the Broussards are happy. In spite of our best efforts, through multiple channels, we have yet to have a reply to our offer from the Broussards, Benmark said. Funds sent to Halifax as bond for work The developer added they provided an undertaking and bond to the municipality to do remediation work on Broussards property. According to Benmarks statement of defence, that meant depositing the required funds with Halifax staff to address Broussards genuine concerns. The defence claim also said the municipality directed Benmark to change the historic crossproperty water flow at the rear of 85 Pockwock Road down the property line with the Broussards to a ditch on the main road. They said that misdirection from HRM caused the pooling of water, but the Broussard property also has a deep low area at the rear that historically flooded. They also said they had never installed a driveway or culvert on the property. The Halifax municipality says it continues to work with the developer in this situation and cannot offer specific comments while that work is ongoing. Robert ShortCBC When asked whether the municipality has issued any fines or warnings to Benmark, a spokesperson for HRM said the city continues to work with the developer and cannot provide any specific comments with respect to this matter while that work is ongoing. Brynn Budden, a spokesperson for the municipality, also wrote that it is not part of the small claims court case, and cannot comment on Benmarks point that Halifax directed them to change the original drainage direction.

More money could be made available for additional trails if damage is identified at a later date. The funds will be used to pay contractors to repair trails and reimburse community groups for work they have already completed. Its definitely great news, said Damon Conrad, coordinator with the Sackville Rivers Association. Theres been a fair amount of damage to trails across the region. NS Trails administering funds The association is one of several organizations, including ATV and snowmobile clubs, that will receive some of the money. It will be administered by the nonprofit group NS Trails. Conrad said the Sackville River watershed flooded in July, affecting many trails along the river. A lot of the damage is related to the movement of materials. Rock, sand, silt, tees and general debris, he said in an interview. The repairs may take awhile due to the extent of the damage and the backlog of contracts, Conrad said, but it will be worth it. The trails are a great way not only for people to go from community to community, but also to get out into the environment and experience nature, he said. MORE TOP STORIES|0

The researchers produced the estimates by combining data on how much global heating worsened extreme weather events with economic data on losses. There has been a sevenfold increase in reported losses from extreme weather disasters since the 1970s, according to the World Meteorological Organization.

The damage caused by the climate crisis through extreme weather has cost 16 million 13 million an hour for the past 20 years, according to a new estimate. Storms, floods, heat waves and droughts have taken many lives and destroyed swathes of property in recent decades, with global heating making the events more frequent and intense. The study is the first to calculate a global figure for the increased costs directly attributable to humancaused global heating. It found average costs of 140 billion 115 billion a year from 2000 to 2019, although the figure varies significantly from year to year. The latest data shows 280 billion in costs in 2022. The researchers said lack of data, particularly in lowincome countries, meant the figures were likely to be seriously underestimated. Additional climate costs, such as from crop yield declines and sea level rise, were also not included. The researchers produced the estimates by combining data on how much global heating worsened extreme weather events with economic data on losses. The study also found that the number of people affected by extreme weather because of the climate crisis was 1.2 billion over two decades. The headline number is 140 billion a year and, first of all, thats already a big number, said Prof. Ilan Noy at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, who carried out the study with colleague Rebecca Newman. Second, when you compare it to the standard quantification of the cost of climate change using computer models, it seems those quantifications are underestimating the impact of climate change. The climate crisis is costing 16 million an hour in extreme weather damage, study estimates. ClimateCrisis ExtremeWeather Hurricanes Flooding Drought Noy said there were a lot of extreme weather events for which there was no data on the number of people killed or economic damage That indicates our headline number of 140 billion is a significant understatement. For example, he said, heat wave death data was only available in Europe. We have no idea how many people died from heat waves in all of subSaharan Africa. Extreme weather Glacial flooding, wildfires and hailstorms cause havoc across the world. There has been a sevenfold increase in reported losses from extreme weather disasters since the 1970s, according to the World Meteorological Organization. However, separating the effect of global heating from population growth, urban migration and better reporting of disasters is difficult. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, took a different approach based on how climate change had exacerbated extreme weather events. Hundreds of attribution studies have been done, calculating how much more frequent global heating made extreme weather events. This allows the fraction of the damages resulting from humancaused heating to be estimated. The researchers applied these fractions to the damages recorded in the International Disaster Database, which compiles available data on all disasters in which 10 people died, or 100 were affected, or the country declared a state of emergency or requested international assistance. The central estimate was an average climate cost of 140 billion a year, with a range from 60 billion to 230 billion. These estimates are much higher than those from computer models, which are based on changes in average global temperature rather than on the extreme temperatures increasingly being seen in the world.|1

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. APs earlier story follows below. ACAPULCO, Mexico AP A day after Hurricane Otis roared ashore in Acapulco, unleashing massive floods and setting off looting, the resort city of nearly 1 million descended into chaos, leaving residents without electricity or internet service as the toll remained uncertain. The early images and accounts were of extensive devastation, toppled trees and power lines lying in brown floodwaters that in some areas extended for miles. The resulting destruction delayed a comprehensive response by the government, which was still assessing the damage along Mexicos Pacific coast, and made residents desperate. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels in Acapulco looked like toothless, shattered hulks a day after the Category 5 storm blew out hundreds and possibly thousands of windows. There seemed to be a widespread frustration with authorities. While some 10,000 military troops were deployed to the area, they lacked the tools to clean tons of mud and fallen trees from the streets. Hundreds of trucks from the government electricity company arrived in Acapulco early Wednesday, but seemed at a loss as to how to restore power, with downed electricity lines lying in feet of mud and water. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. We laid down on the floor, and some between beds, Sauczuk said. We prayed a lot. One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mass. Sauczuk complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beach front hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held, said Navarro. But there were some room where the wind blew out the windows and the doors. Navarro stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mudchoked streets outside. This is out of control, he said. Isabel de la Cruz, a resident of Acapulco, tried to move a shopping cart loaded with diapers, instant noodles and toilet paper through the mud. She viewed what she took as a chance to help her family after she lost the tin roof of her home and her familys important documents in the hurricane. When is the government ever going to look after the common people she said. Inside one store, National Guard officers allowed looters to take perishable items like food, but made futile efforts to prevent people from taking appliances, even as people outside loaded refrigerators on top of taxis. It took nearly all day Wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting Acapulco to the state capital Chilpancingo and Mexico City. The vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. Acapulcos commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights. Acapulcos Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other lessflooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. Wednesday night the city plunged into darkness. There was no phone service, but some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK. Alicia Galindo, a 28yearold stylist in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potosi, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. Her parents and brother were staying in Acapulcos Hotel Princess for an international mining conference when Otis hit early Wednesday with 165 mph 270 kmh winds. They told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down until everything was gone, she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. However, Galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Its one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when youre expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when youre not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, Mexican President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador said Wednesday morning. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been completely lost. Later Wednesday, Milenio TV circulated photos of Lpez Obrador trying to make it to Acapulco by ground, in some places getting out to walk. It was not immediately clear if he made it. Acapulco is at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific Ocean. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, the port has in recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Lpez Obrador noted that Otis was a stronger hurricane than Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people. Verza reported from Mexico City.

S. Columbia River Treaty as B.C. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver.|Victoria Youmans says she hasnt seen Arrow Lakes Reservoir looking so low in more than 20 years. The resident of Nakusp on the shores of the reservoir in British Columbias southern Interior says shes seen thousands of dead fish on the shore, and the receding waterline means boat access has been cut to waterfront properties. Instead of lapping waters, some homes now face an expanse of sucking quicksand. Drought is part of reason. But so too is the Columbia River Treaty with the United States that obligates B.C. to direct water from the reservoir across the border at American behest. The grim scenes described by Youmans illustrate the stakes in ongoing talks between Canadian and U.S. negotiators to modernize the 62yearold treaty, as the increased risk of extreme weather weighs on both sides. Part of the treaty that gives the United States direct control over a portion of the water in Arrow Lakes Reservoir and two other B.C. dams is set to expire in September 2024. I would say that when it was negotiated in 1961 and entered into force in 1964, it probably was one of the most important if not the most important water treaties in the world, said Nigel Bankes, professor emeritus at the University of Calgarys Faculty of Law, whose expertise includes the Columbia River Treaty. Its significance was really that it provided for the cooperative development of the Columbia River the cooperative development of storage for flood control and power purposes, and for a sharing of the benefits associated with those developments. The treaty was forged after catastrophic flooding of the Columbia River in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, Ore., near Portland. The death and life of a great Canadian climate policy It led to the creation of three dams in B.C. and a fourth in Montana in the Columbias drainage basin, serving both flood control and hydropower generation. But recent extreme weather such as this years severe drought in B.C. has exposed problems in the agreement that residents of the Columbia River Basin say need to be urgently addressed. Drought reveals cracks in CanadaU. S. Columbia River Treaty as B.C. lake dries up. BC ColumbiaRiverTreaty The 230kilometrelong Arrow Lakes Reservoir made up of Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake was created when the Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in 1968 under the treaty. The reservoirs water level had fallen to 423.7 metres above sea level on Tuesday a low not reached in more than two decades. Nakusp resident Youmans said whats even more concerning is that its only October, and the lakes usually dont reach their lowest annual levels until late winter or early spring. I personally have never seen it this low, and Ive lived here for over 20 years, said Youmans, who is among 3,900 members of a Facebook group that wants to slow the flow of Arrow Lakes to the United States. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver. There are other commercial concerns. Nakusp Mayor Tom Zeleznik said low water levels had rendered parts of the reservoir unnavigable for vessels carrying logs, resulting in the closure of some businesses, and forcing reliance on costlier land transport.

Procurement requests will be posted next week and administration hopes to award contracts soon. Article content Councillors were frustrated this design was not considered in original flood mitigation talks and now had to approve more money towards the project. They also wondered why this motion was being presented ahead of upcoming budget talks for 2024 and worried about the pace of protecting Fort McMurrays floodprone areas. Council was told on Tuesday that TaigaNova was added to the flood mitigation program after the 2020 flood. Projects for flood mitigation have constantly been added since the floodwaters subsided in 2020, though. There was no estimate for TaigaNovas northern portion until now, so costs werent included in budgets.

Flood mitigation work began in 2014 but stalled as oil prices dipped and council responded to the 2016 Horse River Wildfire. Councils strategic plan for 2022 to 2025 hoped the project would be finished by 2025. About 131.4 million has been spent on flood mitigation since 2014.

Harvesting policies that aim to maintain biodiversity and protect wildlife will help mitigate builtup fuel from fallen trees and provide food and shelter for wildlife.|Liberal MLA Morris guest speaker at Kettle Valley Wildlife Hall meeting More than a century of focusing on lumber value over supporting the environment is coming back to bite B.C., but there is still hope governments and the industry can apply sustainable practices. The Kettle Valley Wildlife Hall was packed with residents from the Boundary Region, dignitaries and guest speakers to talk about wildlife resources in critical danger after generations of what guest speaker BC Liberal Caucus MLA for Prince GeorgeMackenzie Mike Morris said is not seeing the forest for the trees. He was among other guest speakers talking about everything from recent wildfires, declining wildlife populations, atmospheric rivers, flooding and the solutions that could help at least mitigate extreme weather as climate change progresses. Morris has been working on changing provincial natural resource management policies for the past 20 years, with a highlight being a 2015 government report Getting the Balance Right Improving Wildlife Habitat Management in BC. Ive been an environmentalist and always will be, Morris said in later comments. Barry Brandow had contacted me a while ago on this and that was a very good turnout for the area. He explained hes had a lifelong passion for environmental stewardship. When Christy Clark was Premier, she appointed Morris as parliamentary secretary with a sole focus on wildlife habitat. During that time, he studied the provinces resource management, where it was right now and where it is headed. Even then, he said he saw many of the warning signs of disasters happening today, like giant wildfires and more violent storms, as well as droughts and watersheds losing their ability to maintain moisture levels. Also during that time, he wrote an internal paper that was leaked, titled You Cant See the Forest for the Trees looking at the centurylong history of the forestry industrys management of the provinces timber stands. Many of the problems stem from longoutdated policies that no longer fit the reality of lumber harvesting, he said. I really wanted to see why there was this myopic focus on the growth and yield of a tree, he said. It looked at the amount of trees weve lost, the effect on wildlife and the hydrological integrity we lost from harvesting. That led to wildfires and droughts and floods. Its the genesis of the discussion we had in Rock Creek. His paper looked at every Royal Commission on the forestry industry from 1910 to today and he found much of the provinces timber harvest is still based on 1945s commission on sustainable yields, when it was believed B.Cs forest would last essentially forever. Back then, there was no concern for loss of trees because it was believed there were so many it would never compromise the other ecosystems in the forests. This was all based on technology and harvesting practices from the 1930s. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the thenprovincial governments modernized the logging industry with the same myopic view, Morris said. We turbocharged the industry. We went from fiveaxle trucks to 10axle trucks, he said. We had milliondollar fellerbunchers that could do the work of 20 men. We have sawmills that can consume 2 million or more cubic metres, when 30 or 40 years ago they consumed 100,000 or 200,000 cubic metres. This has led to 30 million hectares harvested and replanted with monoculture seedlings that do little to restore the lands or fully support biodiversity, he said. While changing how forests are managed in B.C. may not help level out climate change globally, it will help the provinces forests cope better with sudden events, like floods and fires. With fires, he said better policies around managing watersheds would help keep moisture in the ground so they wont burn as intensely as they do now. Harvesting policies that aim to maintain biodiversity and protect wildlife will help mitigate builtup fuel from fallen trees and provide food and shelter for wildlife. While unhappy its taken years of physical damage to get his colleagues and industry leaders to pay attention, Morris said hes not going to stop, even after he leaves political office. Right now hes continuing to push for changes and is encouraging colleagues to join advisory boards to learn more and bring their influence to foster changes between business and in the Legislature.|1

The Kamloops Emergency Support Services team has once again stepped up to support residents from neighbouring communities that were impacted by floods or fires and needed to evacuate their communities, Will Beatty, the citys emergency preparedness manager, said last week during a meeting of Kamloops city councillors and Tkemlups chief and council. Beatty said the reception centre, operated by more than 100 volunteers and staff members, was opened a few times this year to support thousands of people evacuated due to floods and fires. On Aug. 17, in response to various surrounding communities being placed under evacuation orders, the reception centre reopened and remained open until Sept. 22, he said. During this time, the team supported over 3,500 evacuees. The reception centre remained open almost every day during the fiveweek operation. The ESS centre was first opened on May 3 after Cache Creek spilled its banks, resulting in what village officials referred to as the worst damage ever caused by the creek. Beatty said about 47 volunteers helped more than 130 flooding evacuees. The ESS centre remained open until May 25. The centre was activated again on July 17 in response to the Rossmoore Lake, Casper Creek and Downton Lake wildfires. The ESS reception centre was once again open for a week to support approximately 100 evacuees from the Rossmoore fire, Casper Creek and Downton Lake fires, Beatty said. The ESS team continue to provide services to evacuees from these areas on an oncall basis for the remainder of July and beginning of August. Shane Wardrobe, emergency coordinating planner for Tkemlups te Secwepemc, said the band was happy to be supported by the City of Kamloops ESS to help register evacuees and send people their way when wildfires took off. For us, it was Aug. 18 when the fires from Adams Lake swept into Squilax, Lee Creek, Scotch Creek and the Celista area, Wardrobe said. He noted the band looked after about 200 evacuees at the Powwow Arbour and the Tselletkwe Lodge an evacuation camp set up in Rayleigh through a partnership with TteS and the provincial ministry of emergency management and climate readiness. TteS Coun. Justin Gottfriedson said he believes there was gold star collaboration between the two communities on emergency response. I would be remiss not to mention that the collaboration between our two communities did start at one of these community to community forums, where we decided to be incredibly pragmatic to pool our resources, our skill sets and our experiences, Gottfriedson said. Kamloops council pitched the idea of a permanent local ESS facility to Bowinn Ma, provincial minister for emergency management and climate change, during a convention in Vancouver this September. Councillors noted dedicated volunteers are setting up at city facilities for increasingly longer periods of time each year to respond to emergency situations.|1

The Crown, defence lawyers and lawyers for Ottawa police presented their legal arguments about the documents all day on Thursday and in the early part of the day on Friday.|Liam Fox, The Canadian Press OTTAWA Lawyers for two Freedom Convoy organizers resumed their arguments on Friday in a legal fight for access to internal Ottawa Police Service documents, as they question the validity of police claims that the files are protected by solicitorclient privilege. Tamara Lich and Chris Barber are on trial for their role in the massive demonstration against COVID19 publichealth measures that gridlocked the streets of Ottawa for three weeks in early 2022. They face multiple charges including mischief, counselling others to commit mischief and intimidation. The Crown seeks to prove the two highprofile organizers had influence over the actions of protesting crowds. The trial has been frequently delayed by challenges around the admissibility of evidence. Defence lawyers want to see emails that show what evidence police officers were asked to hand over as part of the case against their clients, as well as any instructions given to officers about updating the software on their cellphones when the protest ended. The software update may have deleted messages between Barber and police liaison officer Const. Nicole Bach, who was considered a primary contact of Barbers. The defence had only received heavily redacted documents in response to their request. The Crown and Ottawa police say the redactions omit irrelevant information or information protected by solicitorclient privilege. On Friday afternoon, testimony from witnesses resumed with the chief examination of Sgt. Jordan Blonde, a police officer who was described as a secondary contact for Barber. Blonde described hostile scenes leading up to a police operation to forcibly remove demonstrators out of the downtown core. Blonde said police attempted to distribute notices to protesters to peacefully leave last years downtown demonstrations on Feb. 16 and 17. When police were handing out the notices, he said, one person took the flyer and threw it into a toilet in the middle of Wellington Street, which runs along Parliament Hill. Blonde said that on Feb. 17, about three weeks into the protest, he witnessed a situation in which protesters were behaving in a hostile way and police pulled out of an area a short walk away from Parliament Hill. Police began the removal operation the next day, on Feb. 18, following the federal governments invocation of the Emergencies Act. Blonde said he talked to several people involved in the convoy who were very adamant to get arrested. He also described seeing an outpost of convoy participants who were gathered in the parking lot next to an eastend Ottawa Stadium, home to the Ottawa Titans baseball team. He said he saw saunas, tents, woodpiles, stacks of propane tanks and approximately 60 vehicles. There were people living in the parking lot, Blonde said. It was an odd sight. The trial is expected to resume on Tuesday with the Crown continuing its examination of Blonde. Defence lawyers said they wont be able to crossexamine him until the judge makes a ruling on the police documents.

Life experience, work experience, community involvement and 15 years of town council. What is the biggest issue in your riding|Election day in the Northwest Territories is Nov. 14, and CBC North wants to give you the information you need to make an informed vote. We sent all the candidates a questionnaire asking them about themselves and where they stand on big issues. Read their responses below, in alphabetical order by first name. If responses or photos are missing, its because the candidate has not yet sent us their answers. We will add answers as we get them. Responses have been edited for clarity, but reflect the candidates own words and views. Rocky Simpson Submitted Why are you running for office Residents of Hay River need a voice and a strong advocate who is available when it comes to addressing issues that pertain to government legislation, policy and bureaucracy. And over that the last four years I worked to be that voice and look forward to continuing that for another term. What experience would you bring to the role of MLA The compassion, understanding and respect I have for all constituents, along with my work and business experience, and education, have provided me the tools that allowed me to provide a wide range of services to constituents over the last four years. What is the biggest issue facing the territory right now Health. For a healthy economy we need a healthy and educated population. This starts with addressing housing, health and education. What is the biggest issue in your riding The biggest issue for Hay River residents and businesses is that of flood and fire recovery for those who have been and continue to be displaced from their homes or businesses. For our business sector, it is the need for additional financial assistance to help dampen the impact of the disasters the community has endured over the past four years. What needs the most improvement in how the GNWT operates Government needs to have less restrictive criteria for those services provided. We need to move from that of a NO government and go to YES government when it comes to constituent issues. This will require listening to the population and identifying solutions for issues of importance to all N.W.T. residents and businesses. If you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would it be At the community level, it would be to facilitate the amalgamation of the Hay River Health and Social Services Authority with the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority. This would allow access to doctors and health professionals, which in turn would result in timely and quality health care for residents of Hay River and the surrounding communities. At the territorial level, the proposed Mackenzie Valley Highway needs someone to champion it, and that is one project I would like to champion and move forward in the next Legislative Assembly. What would you do as MLA to improve the GNWTs relationship with Indigenous governments Government needs to continue to keep lines of communication open with Indigenous governments, and to reevaluate its role in the claims negotiations by moving to that of being more supportive versus oppositional. What should the territory do to address the impacts of climate change Focus on developing our hydro systems for the benefit of our communities and resource industry. Need to begin to make use of our hydro potential. What should the GNWT do to grow the territorys economy In collaboration with Indigenous governments, work with those in the exploration and development resource sectors that have would have the greatest impact on training, employment, business opportunities and revenue sharing for northerners. Tell voters more about yourself. What languages do you speak English. Do you live in your riding If not, why did you decide to run there Yes. If elected, will you seek a cabinet position Yes. Would you consider the premiership, if elected No. Vince McKay Submitted Why are you running for office I think its time for a different view on issues and an opportunity for different tactics. What experience would you bring to the role of MLA Life experience, work experience, community involvement and 15 years of town council. What is the biggest issue facing the territory right now We are broke and we need to spend money more wisely Infrastructure deficit. What is the biggest issue in your riding There are so many. Hard to give one as a priority. What needs the most improvement in how the GNWT operates Need to quit wasting money and speed up processes. Cut the red tape. If you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would it be I plan on accomplishing my goals. What would you do as MLA to improve the GNWTs relationship with Indigenous governments Communicate and work together. What should the territory do to address the impacts of climate change Lots to be done, but we also need to look at the pros and cons. Cost of living is also a huge issue and if what we do brings up the cost of living and its hurting our residents, is it worth it What should the GNWT do to grow the territorys economy Bring down the cost of living and make the territory safe. Tell voters more about yourself. What languages do you speak English. Do you live in your riding If not, why did you decide to run there Yes I do. If elected, will you seek a cabinet position Not interested. I will do whatever is needed to get more for my community and region. Would you consider the premiership, if elected Not interested. Wally Schumann Submitted Why are you running for office Im running for office because I want to be able to contribute and make the North a better place for all residents. What experience would you bring to the role of MLA Being a previous MLA and minister in the 18th Legislative Assembly, I believe that I have the experience and the skills to bring forward immediately to the 20th Legislative Assembly. What is the biggest issue facing the territory right now I think theres many. I dont think you could pick just one, but I would say, going out and talking to the people right now, the biggest issue facing the territory right now is uncertainty and where are we going as a territory What is the biggest issue in your riding I think theyre all the biggest issue. It depends on the individual that youre talking to, because everyones circumstance is different. But a number of things come to the top of mind as you talk to hundreds of people through your constituency during the course of a campaign. But I think the ones that are starting to come to the top are the economy, education, mental health, and I would say, not in any particular order, but the drug problems were facing in our communities. What needs the most improvement in how the GNWT operates I believe going into the 20th Assembly, the biggest improvement we need is to have proper leadership. Strong leadership. If you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would it be We want to create conditions to make our citizens of the Northwest Territories productive citizens of the Northwest Territories and uplift everyones wellbeing. What would you do as MLA to improve the GNWTs relationship with Indigenous governments For the most part, because Ive been on all sides of this equation I was the Mtis vicepresident and president, and I was on the negotiating team in a number of bilaterals, and then I became an MLA and minister the one thing that I think that Ive learned through the course of this last eight years through that process is the relationship between Indigenous governments varies from government to government. But for the most part, things are very cordial and we are moving forward as a territory where, with settled land claims and unsettled land claims, we figure a way to work together. We have a coordinated working relationship to make things better for everybody. So I dont think its just a carteblanche type of question. Every relationship is a little bit different and youve got to continue to work on them. What should the territory do to address the impacts of climate change I think weve laid that out. In the 18th Assembly, thats when climate change really became relevant to the Legislative Assembly on working on what we need to do. We need to continue to work with our federal partners, as a lot of the funding and stuff that we do around these things is coordinated with the territorial and federal level, so we need to continue on that. We know things arent going to change. As weve seen from this past year the challenges that we had as a territory around some of the mitigation, around disasters, around forest fires and stuff were going to have to work handinhand with all jurisdictions, all levels of government, and all individuals in Northwest Territories, to continue to work on the impacts of climate change, because it aint going away. What should the GNWT do to grow the territorys economy Thats been top of mind of pretty much every assembly. Weve got to continue to work with all our partners, and industry, and get out there. And the government, to a certain degree, has to step out of the way to attract investment, but weve got to ensure that we find the best possible way to entice investment in the Northwest Territories, and again, work with all levels of government, communities, individuals, Indigenous governments to how do we attract those types of dollars to help grow our economy Tell voters more about yourself. What languages do you speak English. Do you live in your riding If not, why did you decide to run there Yes I do. If elected, will you seek a cabinet position I think what would happen is I would have to see whos all elected to the Legislative Assembly, and see what our working relationships would be like, and see what potential people are there and decide from that point on. Would you consider the premiership, if elected Same answer.|1

Crown corporation Build Nova Scotia is leading the program, which aims to improve cellphone coverage at civic addresses and along roadways. The second, more expensive, phase will look to close remaining coverage gaps with new infrastructure such as cellphone towers.

Kim Masland told reporters Thursday that she was announcing the initial stage of a very large project that will likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars. It is going to take significant investment, and we are prepared to do that, the minister said. Crown corporation Build Nova Scotia is leading the program, which aims to improve cellphone coverage at civic addresses and along roadways. The first phase of the program includes a request for proposal that was issued Thursday seeking innovative and costeffective technologies and solutions from telecommunications companies. Masland said the initial funding would be used for such things as professional fees and to install equipment on existing infrastructure, such as buildings. The second, more expensive, phase will look to close remaining coverage gaps with new infrastructure such as cellphone towers. The government also announced an additional 3.3 million to build four new mobile radio towers to expand coverage for first responders in Inverness, Richmond and Queens counties. Masland said there are more than 21,000 civic addresses without cellular coverage out of the 461,000 addresses in the province. A need for better coverage The lack of cellphone coverage in areas such as the provinces South Shore and the Annapolis Valley was highlighted during flash flooding that hit the province in July, when people were unable to access emergency alerts or use their phones. I know how important this is to Nova Scotians, Masland said. We saw what we went through in the summer with the climatic events we had. Cell service is no longer a luxury its a necessity, and its a safety issue. The goal will be 99 per cent coverage for phone calls across the province, the minister added. Liberal Leader Zach Churchill welcomed the announcement, saying expanded cellular coverage is something his party has been pushing for. But NDP Leader Claudia Chender cautioned that any improvements should be done with the idea of making cellphone service accessible and affordable, through such things as communitybased services. There are other options, it doesnt just have to be these big multinationals who have a stranglehold on our telecommunications, she said. MORE TOP STORIES|1

Phil Farmer, who represents the village of Holme, about four miles north of Newark, said flood water around the area has receded. Roads leading to the village, on the bank of the River Trent, were submerged. Nottinghamshire County Council has confirmed on Thursday the roads into the village are now open. Mr Farmer said there were still flooding problems further north in Collingham, but the waters had receded quite dramatically around Holme. He said the homes in the village escaped flooding itself but farmers fields that surround the village look like wetlands. Flooding affected the roads into Holme during Storm Babet Mr Farmer added Newark and Sherwood District Council and the Environment Agency were trying to find the cause of the flooding. The waters have receded quite dramatically overnight which is good news but the fields surrounding the roads still look like wetlands, he said. The roads and paths are now clear enough for normal vehicles to pass so teams have pulled back. I want to thank all the workers and volunteers helping residents out. Were convinced that the flooding is not coming from the Trent but from the Fleet which feeds into it so were still investigating that as a district council. But Mr Farmer said Carlton Ferry Lane and Low Street in Collingham around three miles north of Holme were badly affected. The Environment Agency has said water levels in the River Trent have peaked and are falling. It also urged drivers to take extra care as the road conditions remained challenging.

Une demande daccs linformation de La Presse Canadienne auprs du ministre de lducation sollicitant toutes les plaintes concernant la politique 713 depuis aot 2020, date de sa cration jusqu la fin mai 2023 a produit prs de 600 pages de courriels, de lettres, denregistrements tlphoniques et dautres notes. Les noms des personnes qui ont crit ont t caviards pour des raisons de confidentialit. La politique 713 tablissait des normes pour rendre les coles sres et inclusives pour les lves LGBTQ. Selon la politique, un directeur consulterait les tudiants de moins de 16 ans qui souhaitent modifier le prnom quil prfre avant de lutiliser pour des rapports ou la tenue de dossiers. Elle garantit que tous les lves pourront participer des activits scolaires et parascolaires qui sont sres, accueillantes et conformes leur identit de genre. Et elle stipule que tous les tudiants devraient avoir accs des toilettes qui correspondent leur identit de genre. La demande daccs linformation montre quil ny a eu que quatre courriels protestant contre cette politique avant quune publicit napparaisse pour une journe de la Fiert en ducation pour les enseignants du primaire et du secondaire, qui a eu lieu le 5 mai de cette anne. Pour tre clair, je ne suis pas contre la politique et je vois en quoi elle peut tre bnfique, a dclar lun dentre eux au premier ministre Blaine Higgs, le 16 janvier 2021. Jai simplement des inquitudes concernant certains aspects qui vont trop loin et porter atteinte aux droits et croyances dautrui qui leur sont prcieux. Cependant, les registres montrent une inondation de communication aprs la diffusion de lannonce de lvnement de la Fiert, qui faisait la promotion de sujets tels que lducation sexuelle queer, le programme inclusif de la maternelle la 12e anne, lheure du conte drag et la scurit personnelle des ducateurs. Gail Costello, ancienne coprsidente de lorganisme Pride in Education, a dclar que ctait la premire fois que le groupe de dfense LGBTQ dirigeait une confrence pour les enseignants. Un lecteur a envoy une lettre la dpute progressisteconservatrice Mary Wilson le 24 avril. Mme Wilson, qui a t nomme au cabinet en juin, a transmis le courriel M. Higgs, dcrivant lauteur comme un ami et un lecteur dont je peux me porter garant 100 . Lami a abord la journe de la Fiert en ducation avant de faire mention dun mythe urbain propag par les militants antitrans. Savezvous quil y a des coles au NouveauBrunswick qui fournissent de la litire pour chats aux enfants qui sidentifient comme chats, a crit la personne. Il sagit de maltraitance denfants, et les adultes qui soutiennent cela devraient tre dmis de leurs fonctions. Interroge sur la lettre cette semaine, Mme Wilson a dclar dans un communiqu quelle recevait de nombreux courriels dlecteurs sur divers sujets. Conformment mon processus de correspondance habituel, le courriel auquel vous faites rfrence a t transmis la personne approprie au nom dun lecteur et ne reflte pas mes opinions, atelle affirm dans le communiqu. Je peux vous informer quil ny a pas de bacs litire pour chats dans nos coles du NouveauBrunswick. Mme Wilson a transmis un courriel qui abonde dans le mme sens dun autre lecteur le 9 mai trois personnes, dont le ministre de lducation Bill Hogan. Les droits de la personne au cur du dbat Plusieurs enseignants ont galement crit pour demander des modifications la politique 713. Un courriel du 9 mai dune enseignante et dune mre a flicit M. Hogan pour avoir annonc une rvision de la politique. Elle sest oppose lexigence selon laquelle le directeur doit obtenir le consentement de llve avant de parler au parent du nom prfr de lenfant. En tant quenseignante, je ne suis pas laise avec lide dutiliser le nom que prfre un lve sans la permission des parents, atelle dclar. En tant que mre, je ne voudrais pas quun enseignant appelle mes enfants par un autre nom simplement parce que mon enfant le demande. Elle a galement dit ne pas tre laise avec lide que des tudiants utilisent des toilettes qui correspondent leur identit de genre. LAssociation canadienne des liberts civiles a dpos le mois dernier une action en justice visant annuler des aspects cls de la politique. Elle affirme que la politique 713 originale tait conforme aux lignes directrices en matire de pdiatrie et dducation, et que le fait de ne pas affirmer lidentit dun lve LGBTQ peut entraner des rsultats ngatifs en matire dducation et de sant, notamment un risque accru de dpression, danxit, de troubles de lalimentation, dautomutilation et de suicide. Les changements apports cette politique, entrs en vigueur le 1er juillet, signifient quil nest plus obligatoire pour les enseignants dutiliser les pronoms ou les noms que prfrent les lves transgenres ou non binaires gs de moins de 16 ans. La disposition qui permettait aux lves de participer des activits extrascolaires conformes leur identit de genre a t supprime, de mme que lengagement de fournir des vestiaires privs et universels dans toutes les coles de la province. Les changements ont t examins par le dfenseur des enfants, des jeunes et des ans du NouveauBrunswick, Kelly Lamrock. Il a indiqu quils violaient la Loi sur les droits de la personne du NouveauBrunswick ainsi que les droits des enfants garantis par la Charte. Selon Mme Costello, les changements apports la politique refltent une influence amricaine. Si vous regardez la Floride la Floride a commenc par sen prendre aux enfants trans et en supprimant les politiques visant les protger, exactement comme le font Bill Hogan et Blaine Higgs, atelle dclar.

The new death toll was an increase of 12 over the initial tally of 27 announced Thursday. But on the periphery of the city, neighborhoods remained in total chaos. Many had remained incredulous that the governments initial death toll of 27 and four missing had not risen in the past two days.

Security Secretary Rosa Icela Rodriguez said in a recorded video message with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador posted to the platform X that the probable cause of death for the 39 was suffocation by submersion. She said the victims had not yet been identified and that investigations continue. The new death toll was an increase of 12 over the initial tally of 27 announced Thursday. But the storms human toll was becoming a point of contention as local media reported the recovery of more bodies and Lopez Obrador criticized opponents for trying to make it a political issue. Rodriguez also said the number of missing rose to 10. Hundreds of families have been awaiting word from loved ones. In Acapulco on Saturday, government workers and volunteers cleared streets, gas station lines wrapped around the block for what fuel was to be had, and some lucky families found food essentials as a more organized relief operation took shape four days after the storm hit. Military personnel and volunteers worked along Acapulcos main tourist trip. They sliced through fallen palm trees and metal signs. Cellphone signals were partially recovered near some of the citys most luxurious hotels, and authorities placed a charging station for people to charge their phones. But on the periphery of the city, neighborhoods remained in total chaos. The government presence found in the touristic center was not visible in other neighborhoods. With no signal, with no water and no food, families and the elderly trudged through footdeep mud and flooded streets to get to large warehouses someone had found full of food, taking bags of food and liquids. Aid has been slow to arrive. The Category 5 storms destruction cut off the city of nearly 1 million people for the first day it had intensified so quickly on Tuesday that little to nothing had been staged in advance. Authorities had the difficult task of searching for the dead and missing. Many had remained incredulous that the governments initial death toll of 27 and four missing had not risen in the past two days. Hundreds of families awaited word from loved ones. One military official, who did not want to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to media, said officials in his area had found at least six bodies and that his own unit had found one. It had been difficult to find bodies because they were often covered in trees and other debris, he said. In another part of the city, Orlando Mendoza, 46, walked down a highway drenched in sweat carrying two bags of tuna, sardines, water, pasta and soup. He was bringing food to his wife and three young children. Even though it isnt much, its something, he said as he walked down the winding mountain highway toward the city center. A group of volunteers from the central state of Puebla who scraped together some money to help out people in the city were handing out bags of food to families like Mendozas gathered on the side of the highway. Abel Montoya, 67, had been waiting in line for gasoline with hundreds of other people for an hour and a half Saturday holding an empty jug. Soldiers were overseeing the distribution of gasoline, presumably to avoid the uncontrolled ransacking of stores that happened across the city in recent days. I need to be able to move to search for water and ice, he said. Now theres this shortage of food and I might even have to leave Acapulco, go to the state capital Chilpancingo. Gasoline had been unavailable, not because there wasnt any, but because there was no electricity to operate the pumps. Most families anxiously hunted for water, with some saying they were rationing their supplies. The municipal water system was out because its pumps had no power. Officials said the military presence would grow to 15,000 in the area and Lopez Obrador called on his armed forces to set up checkpoints in the city to avoid robberies. Lopez Obrador said the national electric company had told him that service had been resumed to 55 of customers in the affected area but that more than 200,000 homes and businesses remained without power. The federal civil defense agency had tallied 220,000 homes that were damaged by the storm, he said. AP writer Fabiola Sanchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.|1

East Sussex Fire Rescue Service said it was dealing with flood water at the Priory Meadow Shopping Centre in Hastings. Michael Turner, an environment manager at the Environment Agency, said the situation in East Sussex was rapidly developing. He urged people to remain vigilant, to pay attention to flood warnings and not to drive through flood water. Just 20cm of flood water can lift your car up and wash it away, he warned.|A shopping centre has been evacuated after heavy rain caused major flooding in an East Sussex town. East Sussex Fire Rescue Service said it was dealing with flood water at the Priory Meadow Shopping Centre in Hastings. Social media footage showed deep water had entered the centre through an entrance on Station Road. The fire service warned people to avoid the area and said it was continuously monitoring the weather. It added Public safety is a key priority and we would ask members of the public to only contact us in relation to flooding where there is a risk to life. Earlier, it urged residents to move their cars from the town centre, where streets had been flooding. The flooding in Hastings comes as forecasters warn of continued heavy showers and strong winds elsewhere in the UK during the weekend. Areas in London and the south of England, the Highlands and north east of Scotland and Northern Ireland are all set to be lashed by rain over the next few days. Michael Turner, an environment manager at the Environment Agency, said the situation in East Sussex was rapidly developing. He told BBC Sussex We have had heavy rainfall across Sussex, up to 50mm 2in at Hastings, which is a substantial quantity in a short period of time. That is causing river levels to rise across Sussex as well as causing surface water flooding. Business owner Kate Davidson said she was heartbroken to have lost thousands of pounds in damaged stock Kate Davidson, who runs Hastings Furniture Service, said she had lost thousands of pounds in damaged stock. She told BBC South East We have seen furniture all over the place, sort of floating around. Its just heartbreaking. Posts on social media show affected areas include Hastings seafront, the town centre and Alexandra Park. William Sparcia, who owns Sculpture Salon in the town, said his basement was under water. He said It is a disaster. Rain is rain we understand that but this was completely predictable. The flooding comes just eight days after East Sussex County Council published a report into a previous episode of severe flooding in the town. Story continues It said flooding in January, which also affected the Priory Meadow Shopping Centre, was caused by unusually heavy rainfall coinciding with a high tide, an overflowing manhole and a partiallyblocked sewer. At 1700 BST on Saturday, the Environment Agency had multiple flood warnings in place for East and West Sussex including for Crowhurst, Hellingly and Horsebridge, Alfriston, Seaford, Amberley, Arundel, Climping and Bersted. Met Office forecaster Dan Stroud said there was a yellow rain warning covering London and the southeast until the end of Sunday. We are talking about fairly heavy rain, 15 to 30mm, he said. Some spots could see highs of 50 to 70mm with some strong, gusty winds. A spokesperson for East Sussex Fire Rescue Service said there were no formal plans to evacuate homes for now. It said it was continuously monitoring the weather and would continue to mobilise resources as necessary. Meanwhile, trains between Hastings or Eastbourne and Ashford International are running at a reduced speed due to a signalling fault, Southern Rail posted on X, formerly Twitter. The train operator said it was informed lightning had damaged the system. Mr Turner said more rain was forecast and the Environment Agency was also worried about extra high tides, combined with large waves being driven on by an onshore wind. He urged people to remain vigilant, to pay attention to flood warnings and not to drive through flood water. Just 20cm of flood water can lift your car up and wash it away, he warned.

According to the NWS, At 16.0 feet, Minor out of bank flooding will begin along the river. This warning is in effect until Sunday at 301 p.m. Ways to stay safe during a flood according to the NWS In case you reside within a floodprone area or are currently camping in a lowlying zone, it is crucial to promptly seek higher ground. If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Ensure your home is securely locked when vacating the premises. If time permits, disconnect utilities and appliances. Avoid entering basements or rooms with submerged electrical outlets or cords. Should you observe sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping sounds, evacuate immediately. Refrain from entering water that might carry an electric current and avoid walking through floodwaters. Remember, as little as 6 inches of moving water can knock you off your feet. If trapped by moving water, seek the highest possible point and contact emergency services by calling 911. When heavy rain occurs, there is a potential for flooding, particularly in areas that are lowlying or prone to floods. It is crucial to never drive through water on the road, even if it appears shallow. According to the NWS, as little as 12 inches of fastflowing water can carry away most vehicles. What steps to follow when driving in the rain Turn on headlights Even in daylight, using headlights can help improve visibility and let other drivers know where you are. While on the road Opt for the middle lanes and remain on higher ground. Rainwater tends to gather along the road edges. Avoid puddles Driving into puddles or low rainwater areas can lead to vehicles hydroplaning or losing control. Maintain a safe distance from large vehicles Trucks or buses can produce a water spray that hampers visibility. Story continues Avoid flooded areas When encountering a flooded road, do a Uturn and head back. The strong currents from flash floods can pull drivers off roadways. Driving through deep water can also negatively affect a vehicles mechanical and electrical systems. What is hydroplaning Hydroplaning occurs when a vehicle begins to slide uncontrollably on wet roads. This happens when water in front of the tire builds up faster than the vehicles weight can push water out of the way. The water pressure then causes the vehicle to rise and slide on a thin layer of water between the tires and the road, making the driver lose control. Hydroplaning is most commonly attributed to three factors 1. Vehicle speed When a vehicles speed increases, the tiretraction grip and ability to control the vehicle decreases. Drive at a reduced speed during wet weather. 2. Water depth The deeper the water, the sooner a vehicle loses traction on the road. It doesnt matter how deep the water is, even a thin layer can lead to hydroplaning. 3. Tire tread depth Checking your tire tread before hitting the road is important, as low or no tread can lead to sliding. In the event of your vehicle hydroplaning, heres what to know Ease off the accelerator Step off the gas to slow down the vehicle until the tires find traction. Turn into the skid Turning into the skid can help the vehicles tires realign to regain control. Make sure the tires reconnect with the road During the skid, wait until the tires reconnect with the road and then gently straighten the wheels to regain control. Brake gently as needed Brake normally if the vehicle has antilock brakes and pump brakes gently if in an older vehicle.

Try refreshing your browser, or Column Greater Sudbury too desperate for development Back to video Article content I am writing regarding city councils decision to approve a sixstorey retirement home in a South End neighbourhood comprised solely of twostorey and singlestorey homes. Council voted 94 to ignore our Official Plan, the pleas of residents, their planning department and, ultimately, the citizens of our community. This decision is precedentsetting and your neighbourhood could be next. This letter is a wakeup call. In this circumstance, the developer purchased a small lot in a residential neighbourhood half in the flood plain. The fact that one cannot build on a flood plain but you can pave over it with a parking lot created a situation where the developer requested permission to exceed what is allowed under the Official Plan. They requested Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Six storeys where only five are permitted. A height of 21 metres where only 19 metres is permitted. This building will have 150 guest suites. The city has a maximum density rule. In general, the maximum density is 120 units on a onehectare lot. Fortunately for the developer, these rules dont apply to retirement homes. The issue here is the selling out for the sake of an additional two storeys and 60 guest suites. Now, I will address the lazy and uninformed who will call me a NIMBY not in my backyard a colloquialism signifying opposition to an undesirable development in a persons neighbourhood. The City of Greater Sudburys planners reviewed the details of this project with a neutral mindset and recommended a fourstorey building at 15 metres. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The planners relied upon a document developed by staff, with input from the community and approved by council and the provincial government called the City of Greater Sudburys Official Plan. This is where it becomes difficult to frame me as a NIMBY If council had followed the Official Plan and their planners advice and approved a fourstorey, 15metretall building, I would not be writing. Yet, at council, we had two rookie councillors lead the charge, ignoring a senior councillor and past chair of the planning committee to justify ignoring the Official Plan. Their talking points were simply a regurgitation of the Project Justification Report the developer paid for. Most of council ignored the 848 residents who signed a petition against this development, the more than 100 letters of opposition local residents sent and the more 25 presenters at two planning hearings. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content In addition, they ignored a Canadian Association of Retired Persons representative who advised this seniors warehouse would not meet needs of retired persons. The seniors living in this development would essentially be landlocked on a onehectare lot with no amenities within walking distance. Despite these testimonials, Coun. Pauline Fortin demeaned opponents, who were chastised for not realizing this lot could be developed. She could not have been more wrong as many of us were living in the area when another developer presented a plan to council about developing the lot. Where we failed was believing councillors would follow their official plan and the guidance of their planners. Fortin stated I agree this development will adversely affect some local residents, however, we are in a very real housing crisis and affordability crisis, not to mention, we need homes for our seniors. Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Using the developers pricing for their retirement home on Second Avenue, we can estimate these guest suites in this residences will cost up to 5,700 a month. Based on those numbers, the developer will generate 9 million a year in rental income. These rent prices are affordable for the developer for a retired person on a pension, not so much. Some of Fortins other statements also showed her allegiance to the developer. We do not have a traffic crisis. There was no traffic impact study done, just a brief the developer supplied. We do not have a noise crisis. The developer was the subject of noise complaints while building its project on Second Avenue. We do not have a shadow crisis. Again, this relies on data from the developer, whose shadow study ignored crucial data as it ended at 630 p.m. in the summer. Unfortunately, this council doesnt care if some are adversely affected by their decisions. The new tagline for the city should be The City of Greater Sudbury We are so desperate to cater to developers that we will adversely impact our taxpayers, ignore our Official Plan, and disregard our own professional employees to get your business.

Earlier this week, more than 80 properties in Fiskerton were evacuated after damage was found along two sections of the River Witham. Lincolnshire Resilience Forum said despite the damage caused by Storm Babet the river bank was still holding the water. On Saturday, residents were told it was safe to return to their homes. Lincolnshire Resilience Forum said peoples safety remained a priority and confirmed measures were in place in case circumstances changed. A spokesperson said While the weather forecast for this weekend remains encouraging and there is an expectation that river levels will drop, we are also aware that this can change quickly. While the riverbank will take some weeks to fully repair, a 24hour surveillance system operated by the Environment Agency means we can take quick action to ensure those potentially affected can move out quickly.

The treaty was forged after catastrophic flooding of the Columbia River in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, Ore., near Portland. has exposed problems in the agreement that residents of the Columbia River Basin say need to be urgently addressed. 2652 A River Shared Featured Video In 1961, Canada and the U.S. signed a treaty to comanage the Columbia a crossborder river that flows from B.C. The Columbia River Treaty has generated billions of dollars for the governments of both countries and the hydroelectric industry.|Victoria Youmans says she hasnt seen Arrow Lakes Reservoir looking so low in more than 20 years. The resident of Nakusp on the shores of the reservoir in British Columbias southern Interior says shes seen thousands of dead fish on the shore, and the receding waterline means boat access has been cut to waterfront properties. Instead of lapping waters, some homes now face an expanse of sucking quicksand. Drought is part of the reason. But so too is the Columbia River Treaty with the United States that obligates B.C. to direct water from the reservoir across the border at American behest. The grim scenes described by Youmans illustrate the stakes in ongoing talks between Canadian and U.S. negotiators to modernize the 62yearold treaty, as the increased risk of extreme weather weighs on both sides. Part of the treaty that gives the United States direct control over a portion of the water in Arrow Lakes Reservoir and two other B.C. dams is set to expire in September 2024. I would say that when it was negotiated in 1961 and entered into force in 1964, it probably was one of the most important, if not the most important, water treaties in the world, said Nigel Bankes, professor emeritus at the University of Calgarys Faculty of Law, whose expertise includes the Columbia River Treaty. Its significance was really that it provided for the cooperative development of the Columbia River, the cooperative development of storage for flood control and power purposes, and for a sharing of the benefits associated with those developments. The treaty was forged after catastrophic flooding of the Columbia River in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, Ore., near Portland. It led to the creation of three dams in B.C. and a fourth in Montana in the Columbias drainage basin, serving both flood control and hydropower generation. Low water levels in and around the Arrow Lakes in B.C.s southern Interior are leaving some residents concerned that not enough is being done to protect the reservoir. Submitted by Victoria Youmans But recent extreme weather such as this years severe drought in B.C. has exposed problems in the agreement that residents of the Columbia River Basin say need to be urgently addressed. Mayor says low water levels affecting commerce The 230kilometrelong Arrow Lakes Reservoir, made up of Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake, was created when the Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in 1968 under the treaty. The reservoirs water level had fallen to 423.7 metres above sea level on Tuesday a low not reached in more than two decades. Nakusp resident Youmans said whats even more concerning is that its only October, and the lakes usually dont reach their lowest annual levels until late winter or early spring. I personally have never seen it this low, and Ive lived here for over 20 years, said Youmans, who is among 3,900 members of a Facebook group that wants to slow the flow of Arrow Lakes to the United States. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver. B.C. Finance Minister Katrine Conroy said she cant cancel the Columbia River Treaty adding that the province is obligated to direct water to the U.S. for flood protection, powergeneration purposes, as well as for fish. Photo taken in December 2022. Mike McArthurCBC There are other commercial concerns. Nakusp Mayor Tom Zeleznik said low water levels had rendered parts of the reservoir unnavigable for vessels carrying logs, resulting in the closure of some businesses, and forcing reliance on costlier land transport. Katrine Conroy, the provincial minister on the Columbia River Treaty file and the MLA representing Kootenay West, said the province is legally obligated by the treaty to direct water to the United States for flood protection, powergeneration purposes, as well as for fish. Its really frustrating to be faced with a situation that feels like theres very little that you can do to fix it, Conroy said in an information session held for West Kootenay residents on Oct. 18, saying her position as the minister responsible for the treaty does not give her a seat at the negotiating table. The latest round of negotiations, which were the 19th since talks began in 2018, concluded in Portland on Oct. 13. Nakusp resident Victoria Youmans says shes seen thousands of dead fish on the shore. Submitted by Victoria Youmans My position doesnt give me a magic wand, Conroy said. I cant cancel a treaty or change its terms or requirements Often as a government minister, Im confronted by problems and issues that are hundreds of kilometres away, but for me, this one hits very, very close to home. Its in my backyard. Conroy is also B.C.s minister of finance. Federal, provincial and First Nations delegates are represented at the talks with U.S. authorities. If a new floodcontrol agreement isnt reached by September next year, the treaty currently calls for a shift to an ad hoc regime, with U.S. authorities having to rely on their own dams capacity for flood control before being able to call upon Canadian dams to hold back water as necessary. The concern, Bankes said, is that nobody knows exactly what an ad hoc regime will look like because it has never been done before. 2652 A River Shared Featured Video In 1961, Canada and the U.S. signed a treaty to comanage the Columbia a crossborder river that flows from B.C. through to the Oregon coast. Entire valleys were flooded and more than 2,000 people relocated to accommodate the fourteen new dams along the rivers main course. The Columbia River Treaty has generated billions of dollars for the governments of both countries and the hydroelectric industry. It has also meant lost farmland, lost homes, and lost ways of life And critics argue its given Americans unfair control over Canadian waters. Now, for the first time in more than half a century, the treaty is being renegotiated. Veteran journalist and Okanagan local Bob Keating is there. Currently, as I understand it, the dam operators start thinking about flood control operations in February, Bankes said. So, you need long leadups to be able to achieve target flows down in Washington and Oregon. That, I think, is the biggest issue, and obviously it should be a huge driver for the United States. What amazes me is that they havent got it figured out now, because 11 months is not a long time. The U.S. army Corps of Engineers, which built and operates the American treaty dam in Montana as well as a number of dams downriver in the Columbia River Basin such as the Bonneville Dam, warned Oregon and Washington residents in a September information session that waterflow may become unpredictable if Canada moves to an ad hoc regime. Development has proliferated on historical Columbia River flood plains in the United States since the treaty came into effect, and the Corps of Engineers said an ad hoc regime could lead to flooding and disruptions to transport corridors including the I5 bridge linking Oregon and Washington. At this point, we just simply dont know the actual changes in reservoir operations or potential changes in flooding, because we dont know how Canada will be operating their system, Geoff Van Epps, Commander of the U.S. army Corps of Engineers Northwest Division, told the information session. Speaking to West Kootenay residents with Conroy, Canadian treaty negotiator Stephen Gluck said while an ad hoc regime will give Canada more control over waterflow in theory, it also introduces uncertainty. I will say that even though we continue to negotiate, there is an emerging acceptance that a modernized treaty must include Canadian flexibility, Gluck said. Kathy Eichenberger, B.C.s lead negotiator, told residents the province received roughly 420 million last year in the Canadian entitlement from power generation at U.S. dams based on waterflows from Canada. The House 1845 Canada haggles with the U.S. over a shared river Featured Video As Canada and the U.S. renegotiate an old treaty controlling the flow of the Columbia River in British Columbia, freelance journalist Bob Keating explores how the agreement has shaped the people and places along the rivers edge. Then, Kathy Eichenberger, B.C.s treaty negotiator, sits down with host Catherine Cullen to discuss Canadas priorities for the new pact. Eichenberger said the dams also helped avert flooding in the B.C. communities of Trail and Castlegar in 2012. The key is, Canada and B.C., we entered into this treaty willingly, as partners with the United States, Eichenberger said. So, we are committed, as the U.S. is committed, to upholding to treaty requirements. For residents such as Youmans, however, it is beyond frustrating to see Washingtons Franklin D Roosevelt Lake, downriver from the Canadian dams operating at normal water levels, while Arrow Lakes Reservoir recedes. Unfortunately, theres nothing we can do with whats happened now, Youmans said. All we can do is move forward and be heard on the upcoming and ongoing negotiations.|1

I thought Id make the most of the water it was just deep enough to paddle through, she said. Its cleared up now because residents have been hard at work clearing the water we located the drains, lifted and unblocked them. The fire service came down but they said there was nothing more for them to do as the flooding was clearing up. Ms Milne said several garages in the Glenburn Park area of Ballyholme had been flooded and a few homes affected but residents had been sweeping the water away.

East Sussex Fire Rescue Service said it was dealing with flood water at the Priory Meadow Shopping Centre in Hastings. Social media footage showed deep water had entered the centre through an entrance on Station Road. The fire service warned people to avoid the area and said it was continuously monitoring the weather. It added Public safety is a key priority and we would ask members of the public to only contact us in relation to flooding where there is a risk to life. Earlier, it urged residents to move their cars from the town centre, where streets had been flooding. The flooding in Hastings comes as forecasters warn of continued heavy showers and strong winds elsewhere in the UK during the weekend. Areas in London and the south of England, the Highlands and north east of Scotland and Northern Ireland are all set to be lashed by rain over the next few days. Michael Turner, an environment manager at the Environment Agency, said the situation in East Sussex was rapidly developing. He told BBC Sussex We have had heavy rainfall across Sussex, up to 50mm 2in at Hastings, which is a substantial quantity in a short period of time. That is causing river levels to rise across Sussex as well as causing surface water flooding. Business owner Kate Davidson said she was heartbroken to have lost thousands of pounds in damaged stock Kate Davidson, who runs Hastings Furniture Service, said she had lost thousands of pounds in damaged stock. She told BBC South East We have seen furniture all over the place, sort of floating around. Its just heartbreaking. Posts on social media show affected areas include Hastings seafront, the town centre and Alexandra Park. William Sparcia, who owns Sculpture Salon in the town, said his basement was under water. He said It is a disaster. Rain is rain we understand that but this was completely predictable. The flooding comes just eight days after East Sussex County Council published a report into a previous episode of severe flooding in the town. Story continues It said flooding in January, which also affected the Priory Meadow Shopping Centre, was caused by unusually heavy rainfall coinciding with a high tide, an overflowing manhole and a partiallyblocked sewer. At 1700 BST on Saturday, the Environment Agency had multiple flood warnings in place for East and West Sussex including for Crowhurst, Hellingly and Horsebridge, Alfriston, Seaford, Amberley, Arundel, Climping and Bersted. Met Office forecaster Dan Stroud said there was a yellow rain warning covering London and the southeast until the end of Sunday. We are talking about fairly heavy rain, 15 to 30mm, he said. Some spots could see highs of 50 to 70mm with some strong, gusty winds. A spokesperson for East Sussex Fire Rescue Service said there were no formal plans to evacuate homes for now. It said it was continuously monitoring the weather and would continue to mobilise resources as necessary. Meanwhile, trains between Hastings or Eastbourne and Ashford International are running at a reduced speed due to a signalling fault, Southern Rail posted on X, formerly Twitter. The train operator said it was informed lightning had damaged the system. Mr Turner said more rain was forecast and the Environment Agency was also worried about extra high tides, combined with large waves being driven on by an onshore wind. He urged people to remain vigilant, to pay attention to flood warnings and not to drive through flood water. Just 20cm of flood water can lift your car up and wash it away, he warned.

Much like the zombies in horror films, these trees have the potential to inflict substantial harm if not detected early. What is a zombie tree A zombie tree is a tree that appeared undamaged immediately after a storm or drought, but is now beginning to display symptoms of distress. Root problems check if the soil near the trees base is lifting on one side. Zombie trees are a hazardbut unlike their namesake, they dont have to cause fear and panic.|1 of 2 2 of 2 By Scott Gardner When a severe storm strikes, immediate visible damage often includes downed power lines and flooding. Yet, what may surprise some is that the full impact of storms can remain concealed within trees for an extended period. These trees, harboring hidden damage, are occasionally dubbed zombie trees. Much like the zombies in horror films, these trees have the potential to inflict substantial harm if not detected early. Fortunately, there are methods to identify the warning signs. What is a zombie tree A zombie tree is a tree that appeared undamaged immediately after a storm or drought, but is now beginning to display symptoms of distress. While some of these trees might be salvageable, others could be deteriorating from within and necessitate removal. The deceptive aspect of zombie trees lies in their ability to appear safe in the days immediately following a storm or significant weather event, potentially posing a hidden threat to unaware property owners. Photo via Davey Tree Expert Co. of Canada Ltd. How to spot a zombie tree Dead wood or decay dead trees or large, dead branches can fall at any time. Cracks deep splits through the bark that extend into the wood of the trees trunk or limbs. Heavy canopies excessively thick branches and foliage catch more wind during stormy weather. This increases the risk of branch breakage and uprooting. Discolored foliage heavy flooding will cause leaves to wilt or dieback early. Root problems check if the soil near the trees base is lifting on one side. If construction has occurred nearby, closely examine that area of the tree. Nearby construction may sever large roots or compact the soil, reducing root growth. Without a strong root system, trees are more likely to be uprooted or blown over in storms. Poor tree architecture excessive leaning of the tree or branches growing out of proportion with the rest of the tree crown. Odd growth patterns may indicate general weakness or structural imbalance. What to do about zombie trees Identify issues early to prevent damage before it happens with a home tree health check. With early action, you may be able to save a tree. Walk around the yard, inspecting trees for dead wood or decay, cracks in the bark that extend into the trees trunk or limbs, discolored foliage, and root and architecture problems. Is the tree lifting on one side or leaning excessively That could be a sign of trouble. Get an expert opinion. If you notice any issues during the tree health check, call a certified arborist. Certified arborists can address problems visible to the naked eyeplus damage you may not be aware ofand help you decide on a plan of action. Homeowners should always check for TCIA Accreditation, ISA Certification, proof of insurance, WorkSafe BC coverage, and a list of references when hiring a certified arborist. Know your options. Although defective trees are dangerous, not all of them need to be removed immediately. First, understand a trees risk level. Some defects can be addressed to prolong the life of the tree, and some of the care and maintenance can be done by homeowners. Important tree maintenance tips include fertilizing, planting suitable trees and shrubs for our local climate, and proper pruning. Zombie trees are a hazardbut unlike their namesake, they dont have to cause fear and panic. By giving your trees the attention they need, you wont have to worry about your yard turning into a scene from The Walking Dead.

Flood defences would be activated in Ryde on the Isle of Wight on Saturday, the agency said. It warned people not to drive through flood water, adding that just 30cm 11.8 inches of flowing water was enough to move a car. Parts of the Isle of Wight are still recovering from problems after heavy rainfall left roads impassable earlier in the week. Ahead of more flood warnings, Isle of Wight Council said any property flooding should be reported to the Environment Agency and insurance companies should be contacted for advice.|More flood warnings have been issued for parts of the south coast, amid further heavy rainfall. The Environment Agency said flooding was expected across areas of Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight this weekend. Flood defences would be activated in Ryde on the Isle of Wight on Saturday, the agency said. Christchurch Harbour, Hamble estuary and East Cowes were also identified as areas of risk. Frost Lane in Hythe is one of a number of roads made impassable A yellow Met Office weather warning for rain has been extended until Sunday evening. Many areas could see blustery winds with heavy showers around the coasts, according to Met Office forecasts. The Environment Agency said it was likely high tides or large waves would flood lowlying land and roads. It said flooding was expected in the following areas Beaulieu, Hampshire Christchurch Harbour Side, Dorset Cowes, East Cowes, and Newport, Isle of Wight Hamble estuary, Hampshire Poole Harbour at West Quay and Lower Hamworthy Quay, Dorset Portland Harbour at Ferry Bridge, Dorset Sandown, Brading and Bembridge on the Eastern Yar, Isle of Wight Whitwell, Wroxall, Langbridge, Alverstone on the Eastern Yar, Isle of Wight Hampshire County Council said it had additional resources on standby to clear excess water from the highways and any falling tree debris. The Environment Agency urged people to stay away from coastal paths, piers and promenades. It warned people not to drive through flood water, adding that just 30cm 11.8 inches of flowing water was enough to move a car. Flash flooding blocked roads in Sherborne The agency was expecting to issue more flood warnings over the weekend and on Monday. Parts of the Isle of Wight are still recovering from problems after heavy rainfall left roads impassable earlier in the week. Some areas of the island saw 97mm 3.8 inches of rain on Tuesday evening, which led to flooding on Wednesday morning. The Environment Agency said it would be conducting a review after residents in Ryde claimed the island was unprepared. An amber warning, issued by the Met Office, came into effect on the island at just after 0600 BST on Wednesday, but locals said defences were only put in at lunchtime. Story continues Phil Jordan, leader of Isle of Wight Council, told BBC Radio Solent he had asked the Environment Agency to keep the flood defence gates in Ryde closed over the weekend. Initially, the agency told him the gates would remain open and the situation would be reviewed if the weather worsened. However, it later confirmed a decision had been made to put in the defences at Simeon Recreation Ground on Saturday. The timings of putting in the boards is crucial, a spokesperson from the Environment Agency said, adding If we put them in at the wrong time, then it could exacerbate problems with surface water flooding. Ahead of more flood warnings, Isle of Wight Council said any property flooding should be reported to the Environment Agency and insurance companies should be contacted for advice. It added that islanders should wear gloves when handling sandbags as they could retain sewage and oils after coming into contact with floodwater. Two temporary information hubs have been set up by the authority to support residents impacted by the flooding. Affected islanders have been urged to visit East side Kerb, opposite East Cowes Town Hall or County Hall reception in Newport. A hotel in Ryde has been offering hot drinks, showers and a place to stay to people whose homes have been flooded. Jean Fuller from The Veteran Hotel said two families turned up with young children and their dogs on Friday evening, after their homes were destroyed by the flood water. It was quite emotional, it was pretty sad to see those people and were glad we could help in some way, she said. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Parts of northeast Scotland that are recovering from last weekends flooding may see significant rainfall through Sunday, according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. River levels are not expected to be as high as during last weekends storm, but theres a danger of flooding from surface water as the rain falls on already wet ground, the agency said. Europe has been hard hit by extreme weather this year, experiencing some of the hottest months on record in certain areas followed by sudden rainfall. Heavy rain is now disrupting transport and energy infrastructure in Scotland, which is home to the UKs largest oil and gas fields. Train operator ScotRail said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that there will be no direct services between the central belt the most populated part of Scotland and Aberdeen and Inverness until Sunday due to the weather. Parts of southwest Scotland may also experience flooding. Rain is also forecast for London and other parts of southeast England this weekend, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning.

Teaching Wildlife Biology and Management, Cull and his second year Fish and Wildlife students will be collecting biological data on whitetailed deer harvested on St. Joseph Island Wildlife Management Unit 45 and the mainland Wildlife Management Unit 36 in November. The idea is to get as large a sample size as we can, he said. The bigger the sample size, the better the data. Harvest data includes deer weights, age, sex, antler beam diameter, number of points, condition of deer and general location of harvest. Cull says this information will be shared with the local Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry biologist and will assist in setting the 2024 Deer Harvest Quota allocation for those Wildlife Management Units. Youre getting added value information you wouldnt necessarily get, he told SooToday. MNRF will look at the harvest data and decide if there are some trends in the population. If they think theres a decline, they can curtail some of that harvesting to try and rebuild that population. Some of the hunters are starting to say theyve seen an increase in the deer population on the island, he added. Now, we can try and back that up with the data weve got. Cull noted that the ministry can also use the data to find out more about their nutritional status and the condition that the deer are in. By taking those measurements at a deer check station, were getting more information for St. Joseph Island and for the mainland, he said. It makes the hunters feel good too. They have a chance to find out whats going on with the local herd and get an update on the trends were starting to notice. While the project provides college professors and students with the chance to talk to hunters about the status of the local deer herds on the island and the mainland, Cull explains its also an excellent opportunity for students to obtain handson wildlife management work experience. Its a great handson project for them, he said. They can put that work on their resumes and can go into an interview saying they have handson experience dealing with hunters coming in, collecting biological information, and summarizing and presenting that data to a local game and fish club. During the weeklong check station, random prizes will be drawn for fawn, adult doe, and adult buck categories thanks to the excellent partners at the St. Joseph Island Hunters and Anglers Association and the Algoma Fish and Game Club, according to Cull. The college instructor hopes to engage upwards of 200 hunters by inviting them to the deer check station at Reesers Restaurant on St. Joseph Island with their harvested deer in November.

Met Office yellow warnings are in place over the capital on Wednesday and Thursday. Heavy rain is being forecast overnight for several parts of the country as wet and windy weather is expected to build up to the nasty storm later in the week. The Environment Agency has issued 72 flood warnings as the latest band of bad weather hits the country. The Met Office has yellow rain warnings in place for London on Wednesday and Thursday with heavy downpours posing a threat to travel and potentially causing some flooding. A further yellow wind alert has been issued from midnight to 6pm on Thursday. There is a slight chance of damage to buildings and homes and a small chance that falling debris could pose a threat to life, the Met Office says. Forecasters warn the latest deluge could cause disruption to roads and public transport, and even lead to a danger to life from floods in parts of Scotland. Flooding has been seen across Sussex over the weekend, including at the Priory Meadow Shopping Centre in Hastings which was evacuated on Saturday. Photos on social media showed floodwater coming through the entrance. On Sunday, a caravan park in Bognor Regis was left under water, while the towns Tesco supermarket car park also flooded. A house had its roof ripped off in heavy winds that residents described as like a tornado. Kate Marks, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said Significant coastal flooding is expected in the South West of England today due to high spring tides. It is also probable there will be minor coastal flooding impacts along parts of the south and west coasts of England. Handout photo issued by the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation Torro of a house which had its roof ripped off in Littlehampton, West Sussex PA We urge people to stay safe on the coast and to remember to take extreme care on coastal paths and promenades. Flooding of lowlying coastal roads is also possible and people must avoid driving through flood water, as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car. Story continues People should check their flood risk, sign up for free flood warnings and keep up to date with the latest situation at httpswww.gov.ukcheckifyoureatriskofflooding, and follow EnvAgency on X, formerly known as Twitter, for the latest flood updates. The weather is expected to worsen as the week progresses with rain warnings in place until Wednesday. A deep area of low pressure is set to arrive on Thursday which has been named by the Met Office as Storm Ciaran, threatening strong winds and heavy rain to southern parts of England and Wales. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Chris Almond said Winds associated with Storm Ciaran are likely to gust to 80mph along the south coast of England, with a small risk of somewhere exposed seeing 90mph, and winds could even gust up to 50 or 60mph further inland. This deep lowpressure system will also bring heavy rain to much of the UK, but the heaviest rain is expected in southern and western areas with 20 to 25mm quite widely across the region, but up to 40 to 60mm potentially over higher ground. Heavy and persistent rain will fall on to already saturated ground, bringing a risk of further impacts such as flooding in areas that are already struggling to clean up from the heavy rainfall we have seen over the last week or so.|1

Its strategy also includes news media outreach, social media campaigns and webinars with healthcare professionals. Ensuring people understand the importance of this falls COVID19 vaccine is not just about the amount of promotion its also about describing the shot accurately, Muhajarine said. We say, Get your flu vaccine. Canadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.|When vaccines against COVID19 first became available in Canada, public service announcements flooded radio and TV broadcasts and repeatedly popped up online and across social media feeds. When vaccines against COVID19 first became available in Canada, public service announcements flooded radio and TV broadcasts and repeatedly popped up online and across social media feeds. More than 80 per cent of people in Canada responded, lining up at mass vaccination clinics or booking appointments for their first two doses. Federal, provincial and territorial governments public awareness campaigns continued over the next few years, actively promoting booster shots to protect against waning immunity but the uptake was considerably lower. Now, there are two new COVID19 vaccines reformulated by PfizerBioNTech and Moderna to fight the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant that has become dominant across the country. Yet despite the fact every province and territory now has at least one updated mRNA vaccine in hand, some experts say public awareness efforts to drive vaccine uptake arent what they used to be. Doctors say its vital to get this version of the vaccine because it offers protection against the subvariant driving a current rise in COVID19 cases and also because most Canadians are well past the sixmonth mark when immunity fades after previous shots or infections. It seems to me that we are sort of experiencing COVID amnesia, said Dr. Nazeem Muhajarine, professor of community health and epidemiology at the University of Saskatchewan. Overall, communications efforts to break through that amnesia and get across the importance of getting the vaccine have been less than optimal, he said. This fall, we are at a quite a different place in relation to COVID19 than in each of the three previous falls we are in a better place, but we are not in a completely safe place, said Muhajarine, who is also a researcher with Canadas Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network. Provinces and territories now have information posted on their websites about who is eligible to get the updated COVID19 vaccine, where to get it and links to book appointments or find participating pharmacies. But those websites require people to already be motivated to seek out a shot, Muhajarine said. British Columbias system is an example of a more proactive approach, he said. Everyone in B.C. who got their primary COVID19 vaccine series gets a text or email message informing them when its their turn to get the new shot, the provinces Health Minister Adrian Dix told The Canadian Press in an interview. People can click through to book their appointment immediately, Dix said, noting that the message also reminds them to get their flu shot, which can be booked at the same time. The invitations to book have been sent out in order of vulnerability, he said, with the first messages going to healthcare workers and longterm care residents, followed by seniors and people who have chronic conditions that make them especially vulnerable to serious illness. After that, the general public has startedreceiving invitations. Dix estimated that about 144,000 invitations for COVID19 and flu vaccinations are sent out per day in B.C. The minister didnt comment on whether the budget for advertising and promoting the COVID19 vaccine was similar to previous efforts, but said the text and email messages are an invitation system which serve as the best possible promotion. In an email response to The Canadian Press, the Public Health Agency of Canada said that provincial and territorial governments are responsible for their own advertising campaigns to promote vaccines. But the agency said it is also promoting the updated COVID19 vaccine at a national level as part of three sequenced advertising campaigns this season, one on COVID19 vaccination, one on seasonal flu and one on personal protective measures.Its strategy also includes news media outreach, social media campaigns and webinars with healthcare professionals. The agency acknowledged that the overall advertising budget has decreased in 202324 but said its campaigns are increasingly more targeted to higher risk individuals. Local public health units are doing the best they can to increase awareness of the updated COVID19 vaccine within limited budgets set by provinces and municipalities, said Dr. Thomas Piggott, medical officer of health for Peterborough, Ont. Piggott and his team are doing both traditional media and social media promotion, including Instagram live sessions where he answers peoples questions about COVID19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus RSV and available vaccines. Capacity continues to be a challenge because public health continues to be grossly underfunded in comparison to other parts of, you know, public service and the healthcare system, he said, noting theres no word if the additional COVID19 funding given to public health units during the pandemic will continue past the end of this year. Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health, said they continue to do paid advertising as well as media relations campaigns, but theres no question that I think people need to hear it many different ways ... in order to get the message to sink in. Toronto Public Health no longer has the same largescale infrastructure of community ambassadors to reach marginalized neighbourhoods and people who speak different languages that it had during previous COVID19 vaccine awareness campaigns, Dubey said. It also has fewer peopleto workon vaccine confidence teams who would disseminate accurate information about COVID19 vaccination and combat the flow of misinformation on social media, she said. Ensuring people understand the importance of this falls COVID19 vaccine is not just about the amount of promotion its also about describing the shot accurately, Muhajarine said. Calling the XBB.1.5 vaccine a booster is not scientifically accurate and may lead people to underestimate its significance, he said. It is not a booster dose. It is a new vaccine reformulation, Muhajarine said. We are not trying to boost previous vaccine doses, he said. We are trying to elicit an immune response to this current circulating variant. We dont say each year, Get your flu booster. We say, Get your flu vaccine. Dubey agreed. When you hear the word booster you might think, oh well, I already got a bunch of vaccines, Im good, she said. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that everyone six months of age and older get the XBB.1.5 vaccine if it has been six months or longer since their last COVID19 vaccination or COVID19 infection. NACI also recommends the XBB.1.5 vaccine for both children and adults who have never been vaccinated against COVID19. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 29, 2023.

A baby beaver was spotted splashing about with its parents in the stark, blackandwhite video recording captured by cameras set up around its habitat. The baby, known as a kit, is believed to be the first to be born in the area in hundreds of years. We didnt have eyes on the female beaver, so we were a bit concerned, said Meg Wilson, animal collections manager for Capel Manor College, one of the groups leading Londons first beaver reintroduction program. That concern turned to excitement two weeks later when the female appeared again on camera with swollen teats, an obvious sign of feeding, Wilson said. We had an inkling that she might have had a baby and we just hadnt seen it yet and then thats when we found the little one swimming around with the adults, Wilson told the CBC in a phone interview, with a smile in her voice.

Back from nearextinction Unlike in Canada, where the species is thriving and its population is estimated in the millions, beavers in Britain number in the low thousands, with likely only around 500 in England. Hunted to nearextinction during Elizabethan times, there is now a concerted effort to bring beavers back to Britain for the benefits they offer in flood management, water quality and fostering biodiversity. Flood defence is precisely why Wilson and her team applied to set up a beaver enclosure in Enfield, a town on the northern border of Greater London. A bonded pair of beavers were relocated from Scotland in December 2022 and have since created a wetland that almost one metre deeper than what previously existed. They havent even been here a whole year yet and and theyre already doing great things shaping the landscape into a much better, more productive area, said Wilson. Image 1729356568 Caption There are concerted efforts in England to bring beavers back to the landscape, including this beaver, part of a family of five that was released into a west London reserve in October. Dan KitwoodGetty Images Load Image What happened to the beaver Castor fiber, or the Eurasian beaver, is no stranger to this side of the Atlantic. Fossil evidence indicates beavers lived across most of Europe and parts of Asia 10,000 years ago until an appetite for their meat and fur brought them to the brink of extinction by the 1500s. While some European countries like Sweden, Germany, and Austria began their beaver reintroduction programs in the 20th century, efforts in the U.K. didnt get underway until 2009. Thats when the Scottish government launched a trial to monitor the effects of the animal on its ecosystem and released 15 beavers into the west coast of Scotland. The long absence of natures engineers has been felt across Britain. Nature in this country is pretty depleted and really needs help to recover, said Richard Brazier, a University of Exeter professor and director of a research centre that focuses on environmental resilience which often includes research he calls beaverology. Image clinton devon estate Caption The U.K. continues to be plagued with recordbreaking hot and dry summers. Drone photography of the Clinton Devon Estates in southwest England has shown how the presence of beavers has helped to preserve the land in times of drought. Clinton Devon Estates Load Image When the beavers are living in a landscape, they support the structure of that ecosystem, said Brazier. Brazier describes the worlds secondlargest rodent as a keystone species. When they are introduced to intensively farmed and drained landscapes, they can facilitate an increase in water levels, which in turn fosters life of a multitude of different species, he said. The benefits these ecological foot soldiers afford does not stop at biodiversity. A 2021 study of the western United States showed beaver dams can also improve the fire resistance of a landscape and offer sanctuary for species like fish, amphibians or birds that cannot physically escape during a wildfire. Despite this evidence, not everyone in Britain is on board with beaver reintroduction. 95 good, 5 bad It is illegal to release beavers into the wild in England and a special licence is required to keep them in enclosures. One of the groups most invested in this legislation is farmers. Richard Bramley, who chairs the environment forum of the National Farmers Union, said in an email to CBC that many farmers are concerned about the negative impacts from flooding to felling trees to eating crops that beavers could have on their land. But there are ways to help mitigate those concerns, said Alastair Driver, director of Rewilding Britain, a charity committed to increasing biodiversity across England, Scotland and Wales. Beavers are 95 per cent good and five per cent bad when it comes to a human perspective, said Driver. There are things they do that we might not like, he said. But we know how to deal with that. Driver said there are physical solutions, like the installation of beaver deceiver pipes that allow water to drain through a dam and prevent flooding. He also said there are subsidies for farmers whose crops have been eaten so they dont bear the financial burden of accepting beavers on their land. Image Alastair Driver Caption Alastair Driver is the director of Rewilding Britain, a charity committed to increasing biodiversity across England, Scotland and Wales. Submitted by Alastair Driver Load Image Driver said the true financial burden has been borne by the government after decades of not employing these natural irrigation experts. Over my career, I spent millions of pounds restoring rivers. Beavers do it for free, he said. The U.K. government is planning to spend 5.2 billion about 8.7 billion Cdn over the next six years on flood and coastal erosion risk management. Driver said the reintroduction of beavers is a nobrainer that will benefit society as a whole. But it is being held up at the highest level. Not a priority A major requirement in allowing beavers to be reintroduced into the English wilderness is signoff from Thrse Coffey, the U.K.s secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs. Recently, the minister told a committee of MPs that species reintroduction is simply not a priority for this administration. Many of the ecologists and campaigners who have been busy as the animals theyre trying to reintroduce vehemently disagree. It is a priority, Driver said, referring to the 30 by 30 initiative that the U.K. government signed, along with numerous countries around the world including Canada. The initiative has a goal to protect and restore 30 per cent of its land by 2030. It wont do that in the river and the wetland world without beavers back in the landscape, said Driver.

It is one of approximately 27 beaver enclosures of its kind around the country. MayorofLondonTwitter Load Image Living better with nature There is still hope for these wetland warriors who live in 27 enclosures across England, each of which, according to Driver, is a step in the right direction. There isnt a single beaver enclosure in the country that hasnt won over more people because they see what the beavers can do in that location. This is true for local amateur wildlife photographer Colin Pressland, who was one of the first to capture Enfields baby beaver with his camera.

Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said crews were currently out in Looe after flooding in the area. The service also said crews from St Marys, on the Isles of Scilly, Truro, Falmouth, Helston, St Mawes, Polruan and Liskeard had all attended flooding incidents in the past 12 hours. The Environment Agency has issued 12 flood warnings for Cornwall. It has also issued nine flood alerts for the county and four flooding warnings for Devon. The agency said flooding was expected on all high tides until Monday morning. The beer garden at the River Shack was under water A Halloween party at the River Shack in Stoke Gabriel, near Totnes, was also impacted by the flooding. William Parry, owner of the water side restaurant, said The water was just flowing in our front door and we had about ten people trying to bail out the River Shack with various pots and pans. He said they had not seen flooding like this before. Our freezers all fused, we called out for help and probably 30 offers of freezer space was offered from the village so currently our food is spread around the village, he said. We were just trying to get the water out faster than it was coming in, but it was just so high we couldnt beat it. Our floorboards started floating. Highest weve seen Matthew Pugh, owner of Rolys Fudge Pantry on Fore Street in Looe, described the flooding in the town on Saturday night as very worrying. He said For the first time in seven years since weve been here the height was the highest weve seen. We had to wait for it to subside before we came across and did a bit of a clearup. We got off really lucky to be honest. Our kitchen and shop survived. Looking around it is just awful. Theres been bins floating everywhere. Its the aftermath really. You can hear the wet vacuum cleaners going in the different shops nearby. Story continues Everyones pulled together last night, everyone was helping each other out. Flooding in Penryn following Saturday nights high tide The Environment Agency has warned residents and business in areas of flood risk in Cornwall and Devon to be alert for further extreme high tides on Sunday evening and Monday morning. Tim DeWinter, from the agency, said We have got really high Spring tides at the moment combined with low pressure. Theres a lot of rain in the systems as well coming down into coastal areas. All that combined means we have got a high level of flood risk and some flooding particularly in Cornwall coastal areas but it is also having a bit of an impact in Devon areas as well. He said there had been flooding in Mevagissey, Fowey, Looe and Polperro over Saturday night and it had unfortunately involved peoples property. St Ives was among the places that saw flooding on Saturdays high tide David Jackman, who lives in Looe, told BBC Radio Cornwall The car parks flooded... the town was flooded. I think its just damage to the infrastructure at the moment. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said If life is at risk, dial 999. It added that when flooding was widespread, it was not possible to respond to every call for help at once and its priority would be to save lives. The service said people could call Floodline on 0345 988 1188 at any time for realtime flood warnings. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Text from Levee by George WeldAdrianna Ault b.1972 is an American photographer raised in New Orleans, Louisiana.|LONDON . Amongst the unstoppable changing world, the chaos, the growth, the loss, the laughter, and tears there came to a point where I couldnt breathe. I felt as though I was drowning. I went out to the levee on the Mississippi River by my mothers house and walked with my camera. Photographer Adrianna Ault was raised in New Orleans where a 350 mile levee system controls and holds back flood waters. This project began as Ault attempted to better understand the landscape surrounding the city, but evolved over the course of 5years to encompass her changing family, journeys they took and the processing of grief. The levee became a metaphor for the barriers built in an attempt to ward off inevitable decline, and the onslaught of time and nature. I discovered how the surrounding citys waterways exposed the land to a constant state of vulnerability. The physical landscape is parallel to an emotional landscape rooted within the culture of New Orleans and its people. Ault began photographing the project in 2017 and the final images in this new book were made in 2022. Alongside photographs of the landscape of New Orleans and the Hudson Valley, she photographed her children, and her mothers final car journey from Rhinebeck, NY to her mothers home in New Orleans, LA. The act of making photographs allowed Ault to see and process the world in a different way, with a quietness and slownessand in this she found sanctuary. Making pictures in this place was not outside of the pain of losing my mother or the joy and wild ride of being one, rather it was beyond it. It is a quiet place to rest and feel the heartsinking loss and what is found along the way. You find ways to stay busy. Flicking stones, throwing scraps of jerky to the dogs from the porch. Church dinners, oil changes, doctors visits. You stay aloft as long as you can. Devices to hold things in place when it does come plywood cut to fit the windows, gaskets to seal the bottoms of the doors, jugs of clear water stashed in the attic. Not that it matters much. You plan allout for one disaster and you miss another disaster entirely. You plan for the hurricane and its black mold that takes your house.

The Nelson Daily photo Tuesday is the day when ghosts and goblins take to the street to trickortreat and get into that haunted spirit on Halloween. Local police will be out patrolling in and around the Heritage City looking for any suspicious activity as youngsters accompanied by adults flood the neighbourhoods looking for treats. Drivers out on city streets are advised to use extreme caution as sunset will happen at approximately 530 p.m., which means that most trickortreaters searching for candy and treats around neighbourhoods in the dark. Halloween should be a funfilled day for all British Columbians, but it can also be a frightening time on our roads. The Insurance Cooperation of BC ICBC said every year on October 31, an average of 250 people are injured and one person is killed in 830 crashes in B.C. including 28 injuries in 112 crashes on Halloween in the Southern Interior. With festivities set to take place throughout the province this weekend and on Tuesday, here are some steps you can take to help keep everyone safe this Halloween Tips for drivers Reduce your speed. Managing your speed on Halloween is essential. Small changes in how you drive can have a big impact, and driving at a lower speed will give you more time to stop in case a child runs across the street unexpectedly. Keep in mind, a vehicle travelling even 30 kmhr needs about 18 metres the length of four cars to stop. Keep your eyes on the road and avoid distractions. Even quick glances away from the road increases your risk of crashing. Distracted and inattentive driving is one of the leading causes of crashes with pedestrians and other road users. Always leave your phone alone while driving. With so many families out on Halloween night, its important to stay focused on the road and be aware of your surroundings at all times.

Remember to yield at crosswalks. Drivers failing to yield in crosswalks is a key contributing factor in collisions involving pedestrians, so make sure to look out for pedestrians near crosswalks and intersections. Have patience. Many drivers will be moving slowly while on the lookout for trickortreaters. If a vehicle is slowing down or is stopped in front of you, dont try to pass. The driver might be stopping to let children cross the road or for something else you cant see.

Anticipate seeing children suddenly dart across the road or walking in unexpected places like driveways, alleys and parking lots. Tips to keep kids safe Be reflective and easy to see. Many costumes can be dark and difficult to see at night. Encourage your child to wear a lightercoloured costume. Add reflective tape to their outfit and treat bag, and have them to use a flashlight or headlamp to help them stand out in the dark. Many costumes can be dark and difficult to see at night. Encourage your child to wear a lightercoloured costume. Add reflective tape to their outfit and treat bag, and have them to use a flashlight or headlamp to help them stand out in the dark. Plan a safe route. The best trickortreat route is familiar, well established, direct and away from busy main roads. Organize a group to trickortreat together. Walking in a group will make you and your children more visible to drivers. The best trickortreat route is familiar, well established, direct and away from busy main roads. Organize a group to trickortreat together. Walking in a group will make you and your children more visible to drivers. Follow the rules of the road. When trickortreating with your child, always walk on sidewalks and cross at crosswalks. If there is no sidewalk, walk as far to the edge of the road as possible, facing traffic. For teens that are trickortreating with friends, review the rules of the road and remind them to work their way up one side of the street, instead of crossing back and forth. Tips for adult celebrations Plan a safe ride home. If your Halloween festivities are going to involve alcohol, make sure you plan ahead for a safe ride home before you head out for the night. Arrange for a designated driver or use other options like a taxi, ridesharing or transit to get home safely.

Evelyn Salgado, governor of Acapulcos home state of Guerrero, said 45 people were dead and 47 others were missing. On Sunday, Mexicos federal civil protection authorities said there were 48 dead, comprising 43 in Acapulco and five in nearby Coyuca de Benitez.

Otis battered Acapulco with winds of 165 miles per hour 266 km per hour on Wednesday, flooding the city, tearing roofs from homes, hotels and other businesses, submerging vehicles, and severing communications as well as road and air connections. Looting broke out as the citys population of nearly 900,000 became increasingly desperate for food and water. Evelyn Salgado, governor of Acapulcos home state of Guerrero, said 45 people were dead and 47 others were missing. On Sunday, Mexicos federal civil protection authorities said there were 48 dead, comprising 43 in Acapulco and five in nearby Coyuca de Benitez. Among the dead are a U.S. citizen, a Briton and a Canadian, according to Guerreros government. Many residents of Acapulco were still struggling to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives on Monday afternoon. Sixtytwoyearold Rumualda Hernandez from the Renacimiento neighborhood a few miles back from the shore, urged the government to send help after walking 10 blocks from her wrecked home to get water from a cistern to wash clothes caked in mud. I was trembling with fear, Hernandez said, recalling how the floodwaters at her house surged above head height as the storm raged. I thought I was going to die. Fishermen and workers on tourism yachts gathered at Acapulcos Playa Honda on Sunday afternoon to look for missing colleagues and friends, worried officials were not doing enough. Luis Alberto Medina, a fisherman, said he was searching for six people who worked in the harbor. It was really horrible, Medina said. Weve already found the bodies of others. FEAR OF ASSAULT Governor Salgado provided updated figures on the phone with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who during a regular government press conference urged local authorities to ensure that basic goods were being delivered to Acapulcos population. The cost of damage from the hurricane could climb as high as 15 billion according to estimates, and Mexico has sent some 17,000 members of the armed forces to keep order and help distribute tons of food and supplies in Acapulco. ATM machines have also been hit in the city. Two service points will be set up in branches of an armed forces development bank in Acapulco to enable people to withdraw cash, the finance ministry said on Monday. Access to food and water remains challenging, and retail group ANTAD on Monday urged the government to step up efforts to prevent looting at stores run by its members. Members include Soriana and Chedraui. We condemn acts of robbery by the population, ANTAD said in a statement. There is no justification for it. A line of some 150 people waiting for water provided by a local authority snaked down muddy streets in the La Frontera neighborhood on Sunday afternoon, as residents holding empty water containers bemoaned the hourslong wait. Look how many of us there are, said one of them, Emilia Rojas, looking around her in despair. Were so many. This water isnt going to be enough. On a nearby street, Perla Rubi said the long wait was uncomfortable, given how desperate people were. Weve been here since dawn, since five in the morning, risking getting robbed, because now theyre assaulting people in the streets, she said.

A lot has changed in Fredericton since Fredericton Palestine Solidarity was established, in the early 2000s. One of the really interesting and heartening things is that since the early 2000s, when Fredericton Palestine Solidarity began, there are many, many more Arab and Islamic people in Fredericton, said Dr. Brown. The Brunswickan also spoke to Dr. Tracy Glynn, another founding member of Fredericton Palestine Solidarity. Fredericton Palestine Solidarity has been revived during this crisis, with new members, including students, joining their efforts.|In recent weeks, the world has been closely following developments in Palestine and Israel. Following Hamas Operation AlAqsa Flood, the Israeli Defense Forces have responded with ongoing military operations and shelling in Gaza. As of the time of writing, the conflict has escalated into ground and air incursions into the Gaza Strip resulting in thousands of victims and displaced Palestinians. According to Gazas Health Ministry, over 6,000 people have been killed since the attacks began. Many of the victims are children, reflecting Gazas youthful demographic composition. These events have also resonated in Fredericton. Government officials have wasted no time in expressing their support for the Israeli government. On October 10, Blaine Higgs said New Brunswick condemns the terrorist attacks against Israel. We mourn the loss of innocent civilian lives and our prayers are with everyone affected by this unthinkable violence. Higgs had no word of support for Palestinian victims. In response, the Fredericton Palestine Solidarity has been actively involved in advocating for the Palestinian cause. The Brunswickan interviewed Dr. Jeffrey Brown who shared his perspective on the matter. A professor of History at the University of New Brunswick and a founding member of this organisation, he has been an active participant in the most recent proPalestine protests. Im horrified and depressed by Israeli aggression. Concerning Canadas role in the unravelling conflict, Dr. Brown had this to say, It has been to facilitate it, and also obscure the actual nature of the Israeli war on Gaza. However, he also noted positive steps taken by activists. There has been an upsurge in political activity by folks who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, there have been rallies Downtown, he said. A lot has changed in Fredericton since Fredericton Palestine Solidarity was established, in the early 2000s. One of the really interesting and heartening things is that since the early 2000s, when Fredericton Palestine Solidarity began, there are many, many more Arab and Islamic people in Fredericton, said Dr. Brown. So the events are really well attended and there are many more people of Palestinian descent in Fredericton, as well. Regarding the Universitys response, Dr. Brown mentioned that he was aware of a message from the University President acknowledging the events in Israel. However, no organised efforts were noted to support Palestinian or Israeli students. I dont know of the University having done anything, said Dr. Brown. Looking forward, Dr. Brown had these thoughts to offer, I doubt if its feasible in the political climate right now, but I absolutely do think that every responsible peaceloving institution should be engaged in the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign. He continued, I dont think there has ever been a campaign here at UNB to try to move the University in that direction. But what that would take would be an organised effort by the students, faculty and staff to persuade the UNB administration to take part in BDS, Dr. Brown concluded. The Brunswickan also spoke to Dr. Tracy Glynn, another founding member of Fredericton Palestine Solidarity. According to her website, Dr. Glynn is an activistscholar based in Fredericton. She teaches at both St. Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick. I think its very difficult to watch whats unfolding and in the Palestinian territories right now, watching that number of people be killed, she said. I work with somebody whose wife lost her uncle and cousin and a two year old child. I think groups like Fredericton Palestine Solidarity, and other groups across the country, are also shocked by the statements that are coming from the government, she said. Theyre maybe not a surprise, because it follows the longstanding support for the State of Israel. But I think that with every attack, with every blockade of food and electricity, and loss of life, its time for our government representatives to have some courage, she continued. Dr. Glynn also acknowledged that speaking up against the actions of the State of Israel can be challenging, citing personal experiences of being targeted, along with professors and others. Fredericton Palestine Solidarity has been revived during this crisis, with new members, including students, joining their efforts. Dr. Glynn sees students as having a significant role in advocating for the Palestinian cause, particularly in educational institutions, where they can raise awareness and facilitate discussions. We can educate people through talks making connections between settler colonialism in Canada and in the Palestinian territories, said Dr. Glynn. For students, it is often a freedom of speech issue, where Palestinian voices are often silenced. I think if we cant stand up for some of the most oppressed people in the world, you know, we have a problem, she opined. Genocide is currently unfolding. Fredericton Palestine Solidarity is currently promoting rallies, vigils, and other demonstrations downtown. They are also organising a Palestinian film festival at the Gallery on Queen, which will feature a film every Wednesday at 730 pm, starting on November 8 and running until the end of the month.|1

Priory Meadow Shopping Centre was evacuated on Saturday as streets flooded with water following heavy rain. One flat owner told BBC South East flood water had now damaged her property four times. Sarah Lake said Im a single mum, this is all Ive got and its worth nothing now. Hastings resident Sarah Lake said her flat was destroyed by floodwater The flooding happened just one week after East Sussex County Council published a report into a previous flooding in Hastings. It said floods in January were caused by unusually heavy rainfall coinciding with a high tide, an overflowing manhole and a partiallyblocked sewer. Ms Lake said This has happened to me four times now in the last twoandahalf years. My property is now not fit for purpose. I cant sell it, I cant rent it. I cant live in it. Its completely useless. Derek Miller said his business could be forced to close Restaurant owner Derek Miller said he could no longer get insurance after the repeated floods. Ive spent 12 years here. Weve gone through Covid, weve gone through cost of living, energy and at the moment we are just about keeping our head above water. This, if nothing is done, could cause us to close, he told the BBC. Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye, SallyAnn Hart, said residents were experiencing deep anger, frustration as well as tears. She said flood management work was needed and all agencies had to work together to resolve the issue. Southern Waters head of waste water said the company was committed to finding a solution Bob Collington, managing director of waste water at Southern Water, said a meeting with residents earlier on Monday had been difficult. Its many times that these residents have been flooded and had their lives disrupted. We deeply regret that and we are absolutely committed to finding a long term solution.

Serving the residents of Kam Lake during the 19th Assembly was an honour. I am grateful for the opportunity to again represent the people of Kam Lake. Establish a plan for housing northerners in safe, secure housing including incentivizing partnerships, especially with Indigenous governments, communities and the nonprofits. Yes, I am a resident of Kam Lake.|Election day in the Northwest Territories is Nov. 14, but there are three territorial ridings where voters wont be casting any ballots. Caitlin Cleveland was acclaimed as the only candidate for Kam Lake, Caroline Wawzonek was acclaimed for Yellowknife South, and Jane Weyallon Armstrong was acclaimed for Monfwi. We sent all candidates, regardless of acclamation, a questionnaire asking them about themselves and where they stand on big issues. Read Clevelands responses below. Responses have been edited for clarity, but reflect Clevelands own words and views. Why are you running for office Serving the residents of Kam Lake during the 19th Assembly was an honour. Despite the challenges of COVID19, the Mackenzie River flood and the 2023 wildfire season, I was able to contribute to advances in housing policy, universal childcare, procurement benefit retention, while serving the individual needs of Kam Lake residents. Through each interaction, it was my goal to look at the overall policy barriers that constituents were met with to push for longterm change. Collectively, we still have things we need to accomplish for the riding and the territory including 1 integrated service delivery, especially regarding health care and families and communities at risk, 2 education for the emerging economy, and 3 affordable and accessible housing. I am grateful for the opportunity to again represent the people of Kam Lake. What experience would you bring to the role of MLA I am a connected northerner, parent and active community member. The connections with residents have been paramount to ensuring I am bringing forward the voices, concerns and contributions of my neighbours, friends, and family. Today, I bring to this role four years of experience as a regular member of the Legislative Assembly where I was also chair of the standing committee on social development, a member of the standing committee of government operations, and a member of the board of management. I also bring my experience as an active community member, six years as a GNWT employee, and 15 years as a local entrepreneur. What is the biggest issue facing the territory right now I do not believe our issues are discrete, nor can they be addressed one at a time. Our challenges are connected and therefore need to be addressed together. I would say the top three concerns I hear from the people I serve are healthcare, education, and our economy. Residents are concerned with access to healthcare services and programs, they want to know that students are graduating ready and empowered to join tomorrows changing workforce, and concerned with the state of the economy now stressed by COVID, climate events, and the approaching deadlines of mine closures. Affordable housing needs to be looked at as the big infrastructure opportunity that it is. With the approaching closure of our diamond mines we need to address the investment, training and regulatory needs of the mining sector including Indigenous governments to prepare the N.W.T. for the next responsible mining opportunities. In sitting down with exploration and mining companies, two of the most common concerns I hear are a need for certainty of regulatory timelines and a need for affordable, reliable and greener energy. What is the biggest issue in your riding My constituents have been generous with their opinions through social media, familyfriendly chats at the fieldhouse, and during doortodoor conversations. As I speak with Kam Lake residents, I am hearing concerns about the accessibility of healthcare, meaningful and supported education, public safety, improvements in mitigating and managing emergencies, and the escalating cost of living. What needs the most improvement in how the GNWT operates The GNWT is not set up to serve residents who need it through wraparound, clientfocused service. The public service is siloed in operations and this results in uncoordinated and inconsistent service delivery, whether it is for social services or business and industry support. Empowering public servants to provide responsive clientcentred integrated service delivery is key. We also need as well to ensure that we are focused on accountability for achieving the desired results, rather than focus mainly on compliance with procedures. If you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would it be Establish a plan for housing northerners in safe, secure housing including incentivizing partnerships, especially with Indigenous governments, communities and the nonprofits. Housing, though, is more than bricks and mortar in that it supports family and community health and provides a solid basis for working, learning and living in community. The way we build housing will underpin how we manage environmental and climate impacts, as we improve our relationship with the land. An asset management plan to fund the repair and replacement of aging infrastructure will sharpen our ability to build better and save money. What would you do as MLA to improve the GNWTs relationship with Indigenous governments The cabinet of the 19th Assembly worked hard to build relationships with Indigenous governments. In the final days of the 19th Assembly, Bill 85 United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Implementation Act was passed. This legislation will change how legislation is drafted before being tabled in the House and will continue to drive forward reconciliation in the N.W.T. However, continuing to foster relationships with meaningful policy implementation is where the rubber hits the road. What should the territory do to address the impacts of climate change You have asked how to address the impacts of climate change, rather than to reduce them in the first place. We need to do both. Climate change mitigation requires the reduction in the need for energy, and a greener energy supply when you need it. the reduction of transportation costs, by ensuring that more goods and services are provided in the North including food and the full range of caregivers. take care of what you have through infrastructure renewal, rather than demolition and replacement. restore a healthy ecological function through forest replanting and continuing attention to the remediation of extraction sites. On the impact management side develop greater confidence in our resilience in facing all kinds of climate impacts, through scenario planning that supports us in being nimble and creative in the face of any number of surprise events that could happen, including wildfires, floods, droughts, or shortages of essential goods because of similar problems occurring abroad. firesmart and futureproof our communities this requires intergovernmental collaboration because the scale of the issue could be local or regional or both. Improve lines of communication so that people know where to turn for both the slowmotion and quickly unfolding events come our way. What should the GNWT do to grow the territorys economy There are several parts to a thriving economic system. In no particular order, we need to increase the number of wellpaid northern residents who call the N.W.T. their home, and are able to buy goods and services right here. We encourage our students to return north, but an emigration policy can incentivize others to move here. Second, we need to continue to identify business opportunities for the things people need and want, in industries from mining, to northern fashion and art, to green energy and local food production, to energy retrofits of public infrastructure. There are so many opportunities. Third, we need to simplify and speed up an effective regulatory environment and find ways to make business more resilient after, but especially before, the inevitable coming environmental and financial system challenges. Finally, housing is a key input to business costs. So many times, people have not been able to move north because there is no housing. I have heard from Kam Lake businesses on multiple occasions that they cant afford to dream, because they do not have the staff to realize those dreams, because those staff cant find affordable, and often any place to live. Tell voters more about yourself. What languages do you speak English and French. Do you live in your riding If not, why did you decide to run there Yes, I am a resident of Kam Lake. If elected, will you seek a cabinet position Yes. Would you consider the premiership, if elected No.|1

Texas, which has installed razor wire and other barriers to prevent illegal immigrants from flooding into the country, has raised the ire of the Biden administration for having the gall to keep America safe from mass migration.Texas installed wire and buoy barriers only for Bidens Border Patrol to remove or cut those barriers. Now, a federal judge has said that, at least temporarily, Biden cant get in Texas way.The State of Texas has taken up suit against the US Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol, and the officials that head those agencies, demanding a restraining order to prevent them from meddling in the states border protection efforts.The motion for a temporary restraining order was granted until such time as the parties have an opportunity to present evidence at a preliminary injunction hearing before the court.Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared his intention to build a border wall, while the Biden administration has let in nearly 7 million illegal immigrants since taking office in January 2021. By contrast, during Trumps last year in office, less than 500,000 illegal immigrants made it through the border.Biden has not heeded calls from border states or from the major metropolitan cities such as New York, where immigrants flood to the tune of some 10,000 per month, to get the border situation under control. Instead, his administration flies people in from all over the place, drops them off with free cell phones and court dates years into the future, and then will give them work permits 180 days after their application for asylum. This despite the fact that DHS has said that most people will be found ineligible for asylum. They are admitted anyway.In July, the Biden administration demanded that Texas remove barriers in the Rio Grande River that separates Mexico from the US. The White House called the barriers a political stunt. Abbott defended the move, saying that if the federal government took real responsibility for the crisis and enacted some real solutions the wire would not be necessary.|1

Flood warnings are in place across parts of England, Scotland and Wales, and there are also amber rain warnings in Northern Ireland. Ciarn is set to bring strong winds and heavy rain to southern England and Wales when it arrives on Thursday. It comes after a number of areas in the UK faced flooding at the weekend. Forecasters warned that saturated ground conditions caused by the persistent wet weather will increase the risk of flooding. The amber rain warnings issued by the Met Office for Northern Ireland indicating a significant risk of flooding and disruption cover parts of counties Antrim, Down, and Armagh from 2100 GMT on Monday. The Environment Agency urged the public to take care on coastal paths and promenades. The agency also advised against driving through flood water, saying that just 30cm 12in of flowing water was enough to move a car. BBC Weather lead presenter Simon King has warned that Storm Ciarn will bring the risk of further floods in some areas. Stormy conditions are initially likely across southern England and the Channel Isles early on Thursday with damaging gusts of wind up to 80mph, perhaps even 90mph in the most exposed areas. Heavy rain will then spread north and east through the day. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Chris Almond said the winds could even gust up to 50 or 60 mph further inland. He said a deep, lowpressure system will bring heavy rain to much of the UK, but the heaviest rain is expected in southern and western areas with 20 to 25mm quite widely across the region but up to 40 to 60mm potentially over higher ground. Homes were evacuated and shops left damaged after a County Durham village was hit by flooding Tuesday is expected to be unsettled but quieter before heavy winds and longer spells of rain develop on Wednesday night into Thursday. Homes were evacuated and shops were damaged after a village in County Durham was deluged by several feet of water over the weekend. Story continues In Hastings, East Sussex, a shopping centre was evacuated after flood water ripped through one of its entrances. On Sunday, a caravan park in Bognor Regis was submerged underwater. The towns Tesco supermarket car park was flooded, and a house roof was ripped off in heavy winds residents described as like a tornado. People in about 80 homes in the Lincolnshire village of Fiskerton have been warned they may have to live with the threat of flooding for some time after damage was found along a 30m 98.4ft section of the River Witham, following Storm Babet.

The storm will bring disruptive wind and rain, especially to southern parts of the UK, Rachel Ayers, a UK Met Office meteorologist, said in a video briefing. Critical fire conditions continue across a sliver of Southern California, including Oxnard, Palmdale and Thousand Oaks. A wider area is facing an elevated risk both there and along the border with Arizona. There are red flag fire warnings up in the region through 10 p.m. It is Santa Ana season, where high pressure over the inland US matches up with low pressure off the Pacific coast. That creates a flow of wind heading offshore. As the winds cross the mountain ranges they dry out and heat up. The dry air can leave vegetation parched and winds can quickly spread any fires that spark. Farther to the north these winds are also called Sundowners or Diablos. A large swath of the southern and central US extending throughout the Midwest are seeing temperatures drop, which has prompted freeze warnings in the area. Meanwhile coastal flood advisories and warnings are up along from Maryland to Connecticut, including New York City and Long Island, as tides are expected to run higher than normal. 2023 Bloomberg L.P.|0

This decision comes despite a significant surge in inflation, which reached 31.4 in September due to a record fuel price hike. However, the bank anticipates that inflation will average between 20 and 22 this fiscal year, marking a decrease from last years 29.2. The key interest rate has remained unchanged since it was increased to 22 in April 2022, demonstrating the aggressive monetary policy stance suggested by the IMF. This approach appears to have had some positive effects, as a crackdown on black market trading has notably improved the value of the Pakistani currency against the . Moodys NYSE has issued a warning about potential defaults if IMF bailout loans are not secured. Earlier this year, Pakistan narrowly avoided default by securing a new deal that replaced an incomplete and stalled IMF program.

I think there is the need to find a way to avoid garbage collection during peak hours, and this is where logistics applies. It is important to have the kind of leadership in the NSWMA that can lead change through a new system of solid waste management. This is why it may be a wise idea to decentralise garbage collection within the context of a reenergised local government. The NSWMA needs strong professional leadership to lead change with new systems of solid waste management.|THE EDITOR, Madam More often, state enterprises and institutions fail because of nepotism. Why cant we embrace a system of meritocracy to ensure that those enterprises and institutions are led by professionalism The National Solid Waste Management Authority NSWMA, for example. Over the years, both political parties used this agency as a foodeating programme for the leadership as well as the operatives. I want to begin with logistics this is the need to have a logistic department in the NSWMA to organise a smooth operation of garbage collection while there are motorists with people going to work and school. During the rainy morning on October 25 along Grants Pen Road, between Shortwood and Barbican Roads, I was in the line for more than 15 minutes and did not move 200 metres because a garbage truck was on the road. This was happening while the flood water was rising on the road. I had to turn around, like many other motorists, to hustle for alternative route. This is a general scene not just in Grants Pen, but across the Corporate Area, and at times people are late for work and children late for school due to massive traffic jams cause by garbage collection. I think there is the need to find a way to avoid garbage collection during peak hours, and this is where logistics applies. It is important to have the kind of leadership in the NSWMA that can lead change through a new system of solid waste management. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. Second, I hear the head of the NSWMA with repeated calls for people to separate garbage and do composting. This is not how it is done. Separation of garbage must be a legal regime, and it is ludicrous to ask all people to compost to reduce garbage that are to be disposed. People, out of their good hear,t will enter into activities related to composting. The modern solid waste management seeks to develop economic opportunities from the separation of garbage, such as recycling waste to energy and major compost facilities. This is why it may be a wise idea to decentralise garbage collection within the context of a reenergised local government. Local government must clamour for this change, because if central government has no interest in pursuing viable economic activities, then the local government must step forward to urge the return of garbage collection to the local administration. It is not easy to say to these political parties that this persistent practice of nepotism is most destructive to national development and contribute to our continued underdevelopment. The NSWMA needs strong professional leadership to lead change with new systems of solid waste management. LOUIS MOYSTON Kingston|1

Cette habitante de Nakusp, une ville situe sur le pourtour du rservoir, dans la partie sud de lintrieur de la ColombieBritannique, raconte avoir vu des milliers de poissons morts sur le rivage. La scheresse est en partie responsable de la situation, mais le Trait entre le Canada et les tatsUnis dAmrique relatif au dveloppement coopratif des ressources hydriques du bassin du fleuve Columbia Trait du fleuve Columbia contribue aussi faire baisser le niveau de leau. Il a t conclu la suite dune inondation catastrophique du cours deau en 1948, qui a dtruit la ville de Vanport, prs de Portland, dans lOregon. Le trait a conduit la cration de trois barrages en ColombieBritannique et dun quatrime dans ltat du Montana, dans le bassin hydrographique du fleuve Columbia. Ces barrages servent la fois lutter contre les inondations et produire de lnergie hydrolectrique. Ce trait de 62 ans est en train dtre revu par les Amricains et les Canadiens. La partie du trait qui donne aux tatsUnis le contrle direct dune partie de leau du rservoir des lacs Arrow et de deux autres barrages de ColombieBritannique doit en effet expirer en septembre 2024. Les rcents phnomnes mtorologiques extrmes, comme la grave scheresse qui a svi cette anne en ColombieBritannique, ont mis en lumire les problmes de laccord qui, selon les habitants du bassin du fleuve Columbia, doivent tre rsolus durgence. Le rservoir des lacs Arrow, qui stend sur 230 kilomtres et se compose des lacs Arrow suprieur et infrieur, a t cr lors de la construction du barrage Hugh Keenleyside, en 1968, en vertu du trait. Impact sur lconomie et le tourisme Le 24 octobre, le niveau deau du rservoir est tomb 423,7 mtres audessus du niveau de la mer. Ce niveau navait pas t atteint depuis plus de 20 ans. Victoria Youmans estime que le niveau du lac pourrait encore baisser dici la fin de lhiver et que les faibles niveaux deau entravent le tourisme et les loisirs sur le lac. Dautres problmes commerciaux se posent. Le maire de Nakusp, Tom Zeleznik, note que les faibles niveaux deau ont rendu certaines parties du rservoir impraticables pour les navires transportant des grumes, ce qui entrane la fermeture de certaines entreprises et oblige recourir des transports terrestres plus coteux. Katrine Conroy, la ministre provinciale charge du dossier du Trait du fleuve Columbia et dpute de Kootenay West, affirme que la province est lgalement tenue, en vertu du trait, de diriger leau vers les tatsUnis pour la protection contre les inondations, la production dlectricit, ainsi que pour les poissons . Les ngociations pour la refonte du trait ont commenc en 2018. La dernire runion avait lieu Portland, le 13 octobre dernier. Vers un rgime ad hoc Si un nouvel accord de lutte contre les inondations nest pas conclu dici septembre de lanne prochaine, le trait prvoit actuellement le passage un rgime ad hoc . Les autorits amricaines devraient alors sappuyer sur la capacit de leurs propres barrages pour lutter contre les inondations avant de pouvoir faire appel aux barrages canadiens pour retenir leau en cas de besoin. Les tatsUnis sinquitent des consquences que ce rgime ad hoc pourrait avoir sur le pays. Le corps des ingnieurs de larme amricaine voque notamment des inondations et des perturbations des corridors de transport . En rgle gnrale, la province reoit entre 150 et 200 millions de dollars par an pour financer des programmes tels que le Columbia Basin Trust, qui aide les rgions touches par les barrages. Selon Kathy Eichenberger, responsable de la ngociation du trait pour la ColombieBritannique, les barrages ont galement permis dviter, en 2012, des inondations dans les communauts de Trail et de Castlegar, situes dans la province.

The Meteorological Service, which issued the bulletin this evening, said the watch will remain in effect until 500 p.m. on Wednesday. It explained that a broad trough, currently located across the central Caribbean, is producing a large area of cloudiness with showers and thunderstorms, and is expected to linger across the region through to Friday. It added that a prefrontal trough is expected to move into the region by Wednesday and interact with the broad trough resulting in greater instability across the area, especially on Wednesday and Thursday. The forecast is for mostly cloudy conditions with periods of showers and thunderstorms, which could be heavy at times, to continue affecting mainly eastern and central parishes through to Friday, especially during the afternoons and continuing into the nights.

A tropical storm might form in the western Caribbean Sea late this week and could become a threat to parts of Central America by this weekend as the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season enters its final month. Whats out there right now An area of low pressure with some showers is in the central Caribbean Sea, bringing soaking rain to parts of Hispaniola, Jamaica and eastern Cuba. This disturbance has been tagged as Invest 97L by the National Hurricane Center NHC. This is a naming convention used by the NHC to identify systems they are monitoring for possible formation into a tropical depression or storm. In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Storm Pilar is located near the coast of Central America, and has started to move away from the area. Caribbean disturbance will produce heavy rainfall in Central America, regardless of development There are two factors that could lead to the formation of a tropical depression or storm. First, it will move over some of the warmest water anywhere in the Atlantic Basin, still at record warm levels for this time of year. Second, wind shear the change in wind direction andor speed with height is forecast to be relatively low in the western Caribbean Sea later this week, something rather unusual in a stronger El Nio autumn. Therefore, this system has a chance of becoming Tropical Depression Twenty Two or Tropical Storm Vince as it moves west toward Central America. MORE What Happens If Hurricane Season Runs Out Of Names High pressure will steer this tropical disturbance toward Central America later this week. Regardless of how much Invest 97L organizes, it will produce a heavy rain threat in parts of Central America late this week into the weekend. That could result in flooding and mudslides.

Earlier, we mentioned Tropical Storm Pilar is spinning in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Pilar has taken a weird track, first drifting closer to the coast of El Salvador, but is now turning around and moving back out to sea to end the week. This close approach is bringing a threat of locally heavy rainfall to parts of Central America from Guatemala to Nicaragua and possibly Costa Rica the next day or so. And this could saturate the ground before the Caribbean system arrives, increasing the flood and mudslide danger into early next week.

Marie looking to get their winter tires may want to schedule an appointment this week to avoid having to wait until December. According to a number of automotive service providers in town, their phones have been ringing nonstop ever since the Sault was hit with several early inches of snow this week. Marcel Lamoureux, the owner of Marcels Automotive on Queen Street, said his shop is booked up with winter tire appointments into late next week. But thats better than most places in town, according to the mechanic. People around town are being told December from some tire shops, he said. I was out of town yesterday, so we were closed, but today were swamped. Everybody wants winter tires today. I had 20 calls before noon. The snowfall appeared to come as a surprise to many as even Sault Police had to issue their annual Winter Driving Preparedness Month news release two days before November. While his team can only afford to do three or four winter tire changes a day, Lamoureux is feeling more concerned about the dwindling number of garages in town. Two more garages closed last week since they cant get workers, so all those customers have to go somewhere else, he said. Even Im looking for another guy but theyre not available out there. Meanwhile, the local exhaust service provider Jiggerz told SooToday theyve been receiving lots of calls about winter tires. But the Wallace Terrace shop doesnt even do them. We probably had ten calls yesterday and we dont do tires, they said. But its funny, people live here their whole life and forget winter starts around the same time most years. Over at Kal Tire, employees are now installing winter tires on 35 vehicles each day. Since the snowfall on Monday, Kal Tire had already replaced winter tires on 44 vehicles as of noon on Tuesday. The shops manager Tyler Plaunt credits his experienced team for their efficiency during an incredibly busy time. This isnt their first goaround, he said. We know what to expect and we manage around it. Its a little harder when you have a fresh team who hasnt been through a winter rush before, but the vast majority of them have been through it at least once, so we just plan accordingly. I wouldnt be surprised if weve already done 500 vehicles in October, he added. As of Tuesday afternoon, the earliest bookings for Kal Tire was two and a half weeks for new tire installs and three weeks for most of their other services. Canadian Tire, one of the Saults busiest auto shops, told SooToday their earliest bookings for winter tires are at the end of November and into December.|1

Its only a matter of time before somebody ... dies waiting on an ambulance, Mike Merrimen, Chair at Toronto Civic Employees Union Local 416 paramedics unit, told CP24 on Tuesday afternoon. A day earlier, the union had shared a post to social media, alerting the public to a lack of transport ambulances available in the city a situation dubbed Code Red. An ambulance for an unconscious elderly person was over 28 minutes away and Peel Paramedic Services had to be called in to help, the union wrote in the post, shared to X.

Toronto Paramedic Services does not track data classified as Code Red, spokesperson Dineen Robinson said in a written statement. Typically, the city said Tuesday, the current 911 wait time sits at an average of 30 seconds. Robinson said there are, however, periods of time when ambulance availability is low in Toronto. During these busier periods, paramedics are diverted from lower priority calls to respond to higher priority calls, she said, adding that calls deemed of higher priority will always be responded to first. Merrimen, on the other hand, said a lack of available transport ambulances is becoming a neardaily reality in the city. Im getting from my members that this is probably happening close to daily, he said. For the most part, the chair said the union aims to avoid alerting the public to Code Reds on a daily basis, despite that being the current reality. For the most part, we dont want to send out a Code Red publicly every day we dont want the public, politicians, or anybody else to become immune to it, Merrimen said, adding that the union uses the term sparingly. In an interview with CP24 earlier in October, the union said that in 2021, the most recent year with available data, the service faced Code Red situations 1,139 times. When speaking to reporters Tuesday, Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow pointed to offload delays at hospital emergency departments across the region as one cause of the lack of ambulances. The emergency rooms dont have room, ... as a result, ambulance folks cannot offload and they are just sitting there waiting, Chow said. The problem isnt something the city can solve alone, the mayor said, pointing to a lack of municipal control over hospitals. A spokesperson for the minister of health said in a written statement that the province has invested an additional 51 million over three years in the Dedicated Offload Nursing Program, including nearly 9 million to Toronto Paramedic Services through this years budget. Should any paramedic service want to increase their budget, the province will be there to match that request, the statement reads. While Merriman acknowledged hospital delays as a problem facing Toronto medics, the union attributes the problem to a major staffing issue within the service. Ive been a medic for almost 33 years now and weve always had ... offload delays, Merrimen said. The difference now is, after decades of not hiring to meet the demand, as put by the union chair, the unit doesnt have the staffing levels needed to field daily calls. Ultimately, the service needs more people, he said. This blame game of continually blaming the hospital as the hospitals ... is not servicing the citizens of Toronto, Merrimen said. Nobody wins with the blame game.|1

Local authorities in Norfolk and Suffolk believe hundreds of properties were flooded during Storm Babet. The flooding seen in East Anglia was fluvial which is when rivers break their banks, said Prof Hiscox, professor of environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia. In the very northern part of East Anglia the soil is more silty and sandy, he said. Autumn in particular is proving to be wetter than average for large parts of East Anglia.|Large areas of Suffolk were severely flooded Just a few weeks ago most of East Anglia was recovering from drought while September ushered in a heatwave. Why then did vast swathes of the area end up so badly flooded that families had to take refuge in leisure centres Local authorities in Norfolk and Suffolk believe hundreds of properties were flooded during Storm Babet. Suffolk was so badly affected that a major incident meaning the flooding posed a risk of serious harm, damage, disruption or threat to life was in place for more than 24 hours. Communities were seen pulling together as neighbours helped rescue each other amid the rising flood water. In Framlingham, one of the worsthit towns in which about 70 homes were affected, a herd of 17 cows was saved from drowning by members of the public, while in Wickham Market farmers used tractors to get through flood water and rescue people trapped in their homes. How much rain fell The Met Offices analysis of Storm Babet revealed that between 75mm 3in and 100mm 4in of rain fell across East Anglia during the four day storm. As of last Thursday, Suffolks total rainfall during October 2023 was 117.9mm 4.5in which, a Met Office spokesman said, was 90 more than the average expected rainfall for the month. Norfolk meanwhile has already had 77 more rain than expected for the whole of October, with 120.4mm 4.7in. At a more granular level some records were broken. Wattisham in Suffolk recorded its wettest October on record, BBC Look East weather presenter Dan Holley said, with 196mm of rain. That is more than three times its average for the month, beating the previous record of 138mm set in 1960 with data back to 1959. What type of flooding was this Ask Prof Kevin Hiscox about flooding and he will tell you there are six types surface water, pluvial, fluvial, groundwater, storm surges and tsunamis. The flooding seen in East Anglia was fluvial which is when rivers break their banks, said Prof Hiscox, professor of environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia. Story continues Rivers breaking their banks is a natural phenomenon, he said. If people did not live on or near flood plains, the risk would be minimal. Prof Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology from the University of Reading, says lots of exposed landscapes also made flooding worse in places. We did see rivers burst their banks, but also where we had compacted soil in big agricultural areas, that water rushes straight off, she says. Did the drains do their job In our older towns and cities, the sewerage and drainage systems were not designed for the amount of housing we now have, which means they can get overloaded, says Prof Hiscox. It is why in heavy rains you sometimes see manhole covers popping up with water coming out. Prof Cloke says Youre really looking towards major changes to the way we build and where we choose to live. She believes it is not just about preventing flooding but also storing water to avoid future droughts. We need to think much more imaginatively about what we do with water when it does fall, so that we can hold on to it when its drier in the summer, she says. Why were some areas worse hit than others Asked why some places, such as the village of Debenham, were particularly badly hit, Prof Hiscox suggests storm cells play a role. Far from being a monolithic mass carrying the same amount of rain across every square inch, he said, some parts of a storm can carry very different amounts of rain water. It means more rain is released over some places than in others, he said. Dr Alexander Antonarakis, reader in global change ecology at Sussex University, says places without tree cover are particularly vulnerable. We have cut our forests and natural landscapes, but forests are crucial in sucking up rainwater and maintaining soil structure, he says. Forests on floodplains are also key in helping to block the flow of water once a flood does happen. Does soil type make a difference Yes, says Prof Hiscox. In the very northern part of East Anglia the soil is more silty and sandy, he said. It is called lighter land in agricultural circles. To the south is the heavy land which is clay rich and not as permeable, which means a greater risk of surface flooding. They are both glacial in origin but respond to rain differently. Graphic showing water runoff on droughtaffected soils Earlier this month, the Environment Agency said At the end of September, most of the area was in recovering status for drought. However, the agency said that unlike 2022, 2023 had not been a particularly dry year. Autumn in particular is proving to be wetter than average for large parts of East Anglia. Some parts of East Anglia received a month and a halfs worth of rain in 48 hours. How did the recent flooding compare Storm Babet in East Anglia was a roughly once in every 16 year event, says Prof Hiscox. It is not unusual to see flooding in later winter when the soil is already recharged with water. It is a bit unusual to see it so early in the autumn. That said it is not the first time we have had an event like this it is the fourth largest one since 1959. It was dramatic to see and, of course, weve built more houses since 1959. What role did climate change play While Prof Cloke acknowledges that it is a bit too early to exactly pinpoint what happened, she says storms like Babet are getting worse because of climate change. We know that we have more energy and heat in the oceans and the atmosphere, and that means we can pick up more moisture from the sea, and the air can hold more rain. That means heavier rainfall totals for these types of floods. Prof Cloke says that while appropriate development and infrastructure is needed to cope with future flooding, another urgent need is public awareness. We need to make sure everybody is aware they might be at risk, so people know what to do in an emergency and they dont try to drive through floodwater or put themselves at risk. Its really important to make everybody aware that this is a problem. And its going to get worse. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

I thought it would have been a wonderful gift for my daughter. Debbie says the seller whose Facebook page says she lives in Ottawa but has family photos from the Sault had sent her a picture of the Ticketmaster link and the seats that were purchased in an effort to verify the sale. I asked her if I could FaceTime with her to make sure she was real, she said. I didnt want to be taken advantage of. But she said she wasnt able to because she was at work. They also told me they ended up selling one of the tickets and only had three left. Sensing something might be off, Debbie went through the sellers Facebook profile. This woman must have originally been from the Sault, she explained. She has photos taken out in Gros Cap, and theres comments from family and friends. Everything seemed to be legit because I was able to see her photos going back years. When Debbie asked why they were offering the Taylor Swift tickets for face value, when most are resold for thousands, the seller mentioned they only wanted to get back what they paid for because their family member was sick and needed help with medical costs. This person was pretty convincing, she said. Her grammar and everything were right up to part. I thought she was originally going to take her grandkids to see Taylor Swift. The seller provided their email address, and Debbie etransferred the 1,200. She asked me if I received the confirmation email yet, and I said no, it hasnt come through. She said, as soon as you send me a picture of the confirmation email, Ill automatically transfer the tickets over to you. Well, the confirmation email of the auto deposit came through, I took a picture and sent it, and had no tickets. She said she was transferring the tickets, but ten minutes later, they came back online and said theres a glitch and that the internet is down. She said the same thing happened earlier with the other person she sold to, and that it took about a half an hour. Fortyfive minutes later, the seller claimed the internet was still down. After realizing she was scammed, Debbie was blocked minutes later and couldnt send any more messages. A short time later, she made contact with the fraud department at her bank. Because Debbie put in the email address herself and it was an autodeposit, there was nothing the bank could do. They were able to tell me the name of the bank it got deposited into, and we have no such bank in North America, she said. They believe the money was deposited to Thailand or Australia because the bank is called Neo Money. After Debbies daughter attempted to reach out to the scammer, they claimed they never received a confirmation email to prove the money was sent, and she was soon blocked as well. I was saving that money over the last year and a half for my daughters graduation, she said. I just wanted to surprise the daylights out of her when she saw the tickets. She would have been over the moon if she opened it up at Christmas time. Shes feeling so bad for me. When SooToday reached out to the scammer on Facebook, the person attempted to sell us the same four tickets they offered to Debbie. If I am selling the ticket to you, it will be personal, do you understand now, they wrote. If you are interested let me know because someone chat me up for the ticket. The scammer claimed they were unavailable for a phone call because they were at work, the same excuse provided to Debbie this past weekend. They seemed so legitimate and the only thing I can think of is the actual person on that account has been hacked, Debbie said. I dont even think the poor woman knows she was hacked. It was a cruel summer for many Swifties as similar scams have been reported dozens of times across the country in recent months many of them much more costly than 1,200. Feeling embarrassed by the ordeal, Debbie is hopeful her story will prevent someone else from making a similar mistake. I just hope this saves someone from falling into the same trap, she said. Im really disappointed for my kids. To learn more about how to identify a scam, click here.|1

With the village already facing significant disruption, attention will now turn to the unwelcome arrival of Storm Ciarn.|Storm Ciarn on Wednesday may cause further chaos for Camlough in County Armagh Residents in a County Armagh village have spent the day dealing with the aftermath of devastating flooding. Main Street in Camlough remains closed after surface water forced motorists to abandon their cars, and damaged homes and businesses. In the relative calm before Storm Ciarn arrives on Wednesday, some took the opportunity to assess the damage. Paul, a volunteer at Camlough Rovers FC, brought BBC News NI on his morning pitch inspection. The news was not good. The clubs 3G pitch, often used by youth teams and childrens birthday parties, was almost entirely submerged. Its devastating. Were under six inches of water here, he told BBC News NI. There are fears the 3G pitch in Camlough may have to be replaced There was supposed to be a Halloween camp here on Wednesday but thats not going to happen. There would have been maybe 70 children here Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, he continued. There will be nothing for the kids all this week. We are panicking Even when the floodwater recedes, Paul fears that the surface of the pitch may be irreparably damaged. We are a charity here and were just panicking, he added. We dont know what way this 3G is going to work out, whether it is going to need resurfaced. Asked if the club could afford to resurface the pitch he said No, definitely not that would be big big money. Homes and businesses have been damaged by the flooding, with drivers forced to abandon their vehicles Pauls 17yearold daughter Ellen plays for Northern Ireland and is worried the damage to the pitch may have an impact on her international ambitions. Im not going to have any club training at the moment. Im going to be out of football for a good while. The other ones are going to be training away and Im going to have no training so its going to impact my fitness and everything. Its going to have a big downside. Horses stranded On Monday, Camlough resident Gary Murphy had a sleepless night. With rain still falling, he feared for his three horses. Story continues I came down here yesterday for feeding and the place was flooded, I couldnt get at them, he confessed. They were stressed out, they were stranded. Just a wee small island was all they had, and the water was just rising, rising, rising. Rescue teams came to the aid of three horses who were stranded due to the flooding On Tuesday morning, with flood waters water still rising, Gary rang 999. The operation lasted hours, but the afternoon the fire service had managed to move all three horses to safety. Reunited with his animals, Gary was pleased to find the horses in good health. Theyre a bit shaken, Ill have to ring the vet here and see what I can give them. Hopefully theyll be all right now, he added. The fire brigade and animal rescue were very helpful. They were absolutely brilliant. Ive never seen anything like this For some in Camlough, the flooding hit closer to home. Paul Brannigan lives near some of the worst affected areas. His home began to flood late on Monday evening. Ive had four inches of water in each room, Ive had to brush it out. Theres a fair bit of damage. Paul Brannigan says his home on the villages main street has been damaged In spite of the waters retreat, Pauls house continued to see inflows. As motorists drove through the deep puddles that mark even the open sections of Main Street, his home sustained further damage. When the lorries or vans go past it soars and it just runs straight in. Paul told BBC News NI that his home had never previously been flooded. The water would have built up there a bit before but never came up to the door. Never, never, never anything like this before. Paul can count himself as particularly unlucky Its got me twice. Pointing towards heavily flooded bridge a few streets away, he added My yard is just below there. With the village already facing significant disruption, attention will now turn to the unwelcome arrival of Storm Ciarn.|1

The Canadian had been living in Acapulco for some time and was not considered a tourist, local prosecutors said. Global Affairs Canada is aware of reports of the death of a Canadian citizen in Acapulco, the agency said in a statement to CBC News. At least 45 people were killed when Otis roared ashore last Wednesday with devastating 266 kmh winds after strengthening so rapidly that people had little time to prepare.

The Canadian had been living in Acapulco for some time and was not considered a tourist, local prosecutors said. Global Affairs Canada is aware of reports of the death of a Canadian citizen in Acapulco, the agency said in a statement to CBC News. Consular officials are in contact with local authorities to obtain additional information. At least 45 people were killed when Otis roared ashore last Wednesday with devastating 266 kmh winds after strengthening so rapidly that people had little time to prepare. Mexicos navy said on Monday that search efforts would now focus on finding possible bodies among the 29 boats known to have sunk in Acapulco Bay the night the hurricane hit. PHOTOS Aftermath of Hurricane Otis in Acapulco There have been continuing reports that some crew members were aboard boats during the storm. Acapulco is known for both its abundance of expensive yachts and its cheap tour boats that carry tourists around the bay. In previous hurricanes in Acapulco, most of the dead were swept away by flooding on land. But with Otis, a significant number appear to have died at sea. Local residents have said that some crews had either chosen or been ordered to stay aboard to guard their craft. Officials from the national electric company promised to have power restored in all of Acapulco by late Tuesday, a full week after the hurricane hit. Aid has been slow to arrive. The storms destruction cut off the city of nearly one million people for the first day, and because Otis had intensified so quickly on Tuesday, little to nothing had been staged in advance. The federal civil defence agency determined that 220,000 homes were damaged by the hurricane, which blew out the windows and walls of some highrise hotels and ripped the tin roofs off thousands of homes.|1

But it currently has no flood insurance as many businesses in the area cannot get cover for flood damage. Were tried our best to save the machinery and stuff but there was no hope, he told BBC News NI. The basement of BMC Accountants in Commercial House, NewryThe basement is flooded to waistlevel, he told BBC News NI.|Business owners have spoken of their devastation after flooding in Newry city centre damaged several buildings and ruined shop equipment and stock. The streets around Newry City Hall were among the worst hit areas when Newry Canal burst its banks overnight. Roads were also flooded in other parts of County Down and County Armagh. A yellow weather warning for heavy rain is in place until Wednesday at 0900 GMT. This would be affecting already very saturated ground, Paddy Lavery from the Department for Infrastructure told BBC News NI. He said crews faced a challenge to deal with the flooding. We have measurements on the rivers, loughs, tides and we havent seen this before, he told the Evening Extra programme. This is an area we havent dealt with. We have a finite resource. Where is the water to get away to We are resorting to providing sandbags to protect properties, he said. Mr Lavery said water levels were unprecedented and four roads had been affected by landslips. Train lines and bus services were also affected by the weather conditions, with more heavy rain expected in the coming days due to Storm Ciarn. McCartan Bros, a familyrun clothes shop on Sugar Island in Newry, sustained thousands of pounds worth of damage, according to its owner Paul McCartan. Some people paddled a boat along the road outside his store, as the businessman tried to salvage what was left of his stock. Mr McCartan told BBC News NI that the damage will run into thousands of pounds as his shop was full of new items, ready for Christmas. The store has been operating in Newry for 64 years, having been founded by his father and uncle in 1959. But it currently has no flood insurance as many businesses in the area cannot get cover for flood damage. Thank you to everyone for your kind words and support. This will take some time to process but well be back thanks to the strong community we have around us. If your home or business has been affected our thoughts and wishes are with you too. pic.twitter.comiBuuqM3zYW McCartan Bros Newry mccartanbros October 31, 2023 The store was also closed for refurbishment this month, with new flooring and toilets installed. Story continues Mr McCartan said part of that new flooring came floating past him as he forced his way into the building to try to salvage any dry stock that he could. He estimated it could take four to six months to fix the damage. On Tuesday evening, police urged the public to avoid the canal and the river due to the hazardous conditions caused by high water levels and the fast flowing current. It is understood part of the wall at Merchants Quay collapsed, allowing water to seep through. In Dundonald, near Belfast, some patients at the Ulster Hospital had to be moved after a rainwater pipe became blocked, causing water damage to a small number of rooms. Some roads have also been impassable in places including Killowen, Camlough, Moira, Ballynahinch and Bangor. Flooded to waistlevel Brendan Downey, director of the Friar Tucks fast food firm, said the damage to his Sugar Island restaurant in Newry was catastrophic. Everything is destroyed. Were tried our best to save the machinery and stuff but there was no hope, he told BBC News NI. An army of men wouldnt have sorted it out last night we had lorryloads of sandbags. All eyes on the tide Catherine Morrison, BBC News NI reporter in Newry Newry is a city of sandbags. Thousands of them, possibly as many as 10,000, are lining the banks of the canal and the river. Many are piled up outside businesses, in an attempt to keep the waters at bay. It is not currently raining, although a weather warning for rain kicks in again at 2100. Even if the rain levels arent as high as earlier, theres a fear that due to the already sodden ground, further damage could be caused. All eyes are on the overnight high tide, expected after midnight. At Merchants Quay in Newry, Brian McCullaghs firm, BMC Accountants, is among the buildings which filled up with water. He said it was quite devastating. The basement of BMC Accountants in Commercial House, Newry The basement is flooded to waistlevel, he told BBC News NI. Although we went paperless a few years ago, all the old files are still down there and so theres been a lot of damage. I spent a lot of money on a listed building from 1820 and we came in this morning to find it flooded completely in the basement. The building, Commercial House, is just feet away from Newry Canal and Mr McCullagh said businesses in the area could not get flood insurance. A driver got into difficulty near Richhill, County Armagh Killowen in County Down recorded 75.4mm of rain between 0900 on Monday and 0900 on Tuesday, the wettest climate day on record for that station since data was first collected in 1997. The wettest day on record for Northern Ireland was 31 October 1968 when 158.9mm fell at Tollymore Forest, County Down. There are two weather warnings in place in the coming days. The warning which ends at 0900 on Wednesday is in place for the whole of Northern Ireland, with the Met Office expecting 1520mm of rain in many places. From 0600 on Thursday until midnight on Thursday there are yellow warnings for County Down, southern County Antrim and parts of County Armagh, when Storm Ciarn is expected to bring some heavy rain to eastern areas.

Its almost in biblical proportions in some places, he said, adding that several businesses were looking to see if they could open elsewhere. Its very bleak and unprecedented, he said. Newry and Armagh councillor Oonagh Magennis said severe flooding was causing havoc throughout the area, including Camlough village in south Armagh. Video footage on social media showed flooding in the forecourt of Camloughs biggest shop and petrol station. Three horses were rescued by firefighters in the village after they were stranded by floodwater. Gary Murphy said he couldnt reach his horses until firefighters helped Their owner, Gary Murphy, said they had been left shaken.

The National Farmers Union NFU said it was calling on all political parties to set out their plans to protect farmland from flooding which puts the countrys food security at risk, following the devastation caused by Storm Babet. The NFU has written an open letter calling on the Environment Agency to deliver a proactive plan for the watercourses and flood defences it manages and for the Government to pay farmers and growers fairly for the role they play in protecting homes and businesses when rivers breach their banks. Flooded fields in Powys in Wales Ben BirchallPA The letter also calls for changes to the Flood Defence Grant to ensure that rural communities are not disadvantaged by the nature of smaller populations in comparison to urban communities. NFU deputy president Tom Bradshaw said Despite promises made during each catastrophic flooding event, repeated governments of all parties have failed to get to grips with the challenge of managing watercourses and flooding. With another storm forecast this week, we need to see plans come forward as a matter of urgency. He added I have been out to meet NFU members and have seen firsthand the destruction and financial stress caused by flooding to farmers businesses and their homes. David Armstrong, a farmer in Lincolnshire, said that some of his farms winter linseed and wheat crops had been left underwater by recent flooding. The 62yearold told the PA news agency that he now faced an effort to preserve what crop weve got and redrill the areas which have been flooded. He said he thought that were not as well prepared now as weve been in the past for flooding and other extreme weather events, adding that there needed to be a lot better maintenance of rivers and watercourses.

A spokesperson for Defra said Farmers are already eligible for support through the Flood Recovery Framework announced last week, including a grant of up to 2,500 as part of the Business Recovery Grant. The Government will also be introducing further natural flood management measures as part of the Environmental Land Management scheme next year to support flood mitigation. An Environment Agency spokesperson said We are acutely aware of the impacts flooding can have on farmers and the agriculture sector, and our teams are working hard on the ground to help people recover from the impacts of Storm Babet. Between April 2021 and April 2023 we have better protected around 148,000 hectares of agricultural land through our flooding investment programme.

Otis battered Acapulco with winds of 165 miles per hour 266 km per hour on Wednesday, flooding the city, tearing roofs from homes, hotels and other businesses, submerging vehicles, and severing communications as well as road and air connections. Looting broke out as the citys population of nearly 900,000 became increasingly desperate for food and water. Evelyn Salgado, governor of Acapulcos home state of Guerrero, said 45 people were dead and 47 others were missing. On Sunday, Mexicos federal civil protection authorities said there were 48 dead, comprising 43 in Acapulco and five in nearby Coyuca de Benitez.

Sixtytwoyearold Rumualda Hernandez from the Renacimiento neighborhood a few miles back from the shore, urged the government to send help after walking 10 blocks from her wrecked home to get water from a cistern to wash clothes caked in mud. I was trembling with fear, Hernandez said, recalling how the floodwaters at her house surged above head height as the storm raged. I thought I was going to die. Fishermen and workers on tourism yachts gathered at Acapulcos Playa Honda on Sunday afternoon to look for missing colleagues and friends, worried officials were not doing enough. Luis Alberto Medina, a fisherman, said he was searching for six people who worked in the harbor. Story continues below advertisement It was really horrible, Medina said.

Story continues below advertisement The cost of damage from the hurricane could climb as high as 15 billion according to estimates, and Mexico has sent some 17,000 members of the armed forces to keep order and help distribute tons of food and supplies in Acapulco. ATM machines have also been hit in the city. Two service points will be set up in branches of an armed forces development bank in Acapulco to enable people to withdraw cash, the finance ministry said on Monday. 141 Hurricane Otis slams Mexico as Category 5 storm Access to food and water remains challenging, and retail group ANTAD on Monday urged the government to step up efforts to prevent looting at stores run by its members. Members include Soriana and Chedraui. We condemn acts of robbery by the population, ANTAD said in a statement. There is no justification for it.
