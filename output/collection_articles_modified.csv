He grew up in New York when winters were snowy and summers were hot but bearable. He said todays New York reminds him more of Miami than the place he remembers from childhood. In 2020, the National Climate Assessment changed New York Citys climate classification from continental to humid subtropical characterized by mild winters, humid summers and intense rainfall. The city has so far lived up to the new label. Winters have become noticeably warmer. And last weeks storm added to the list of recent record rainfall, bringing back memories of Hurricane Henri in August 2021 and Hurricane Ida in September 2021. What we once thought of as a rare event, a low probability of occurrence maybe these events are increasing in frequency, said Nelson Vaz, a meteorologist at the New York office of the National Weather Service. Aggarwala is leading the charge on the citys climate adaptation strategy. When it comes to rain, Aggarwala is concerned about the lack of permeable surfaces in the city due to people paving over lawns and grass in favor of, for example, new parking spots. What that means is that theres nowhere for the rainwater falling on that property to go, he said. Some ways hes looking to address it Turning basketball court enclosures into giant rain buckets, developing pockets of wetlands, installing socalled rain gardens on sidewalks, and building walls along the shorelines to keep out coastal storms.",0

And its a horrific step backwards for the borderlands, Laiken Jordahl, a southwest conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Wednesday afternoon. 204 Our borders are not open U.S. prepares for migrant surge as Title 42 ends During the Trump administration, about 450 miles of barriers were built along the southwest border between 2017 and January 2021. Texas Governor Greg Abbott renewed those efforts after the Biden administration halted them at the start of his presidency. The DHS decision on Wednesday contrasts the Biden administrations posturing when a proclamation to end the construction on Jan. 20, 2021 stated, building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution. U.S. Customs and Border Protection had no immediate comment. Story continues below advertisement The announcement prompted political debate by the Democratic administration facing an increase of migrants entering through the southern border in recent months, including thousands who entered the U.S. through Eagle Pass at the end of September. 028 Trump visits southern border wall construction in Arizona A border wall is a 14th century solution to a 21st century problem. It will not bolster border security in Starr County, U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar said in a statement. I continue to stand against the wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective border wall. Political proponents of the border wall said the waivers should be used as a launching pad for a shift in policy. After years of denying that a border wall and other physical barriers are effective, the DHS announcement represents a sea change in the administrations thinking A secure wall is an effective tool for maintaining control of our borders, Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said in a statement. Story continues below advertisement Having made that concession, the administration needs to immediately begin construction of wall across the border to prevent the illegal traffic from simply moving to other areas of the border. In August, the U.S. Border Patrol made 181,509 arrests at the Mexican border, up 37 from July but little changed from August 2022 and well below the more than 220,000 in December, according to figures released in September.",1

Watch sidebyside drone footage showing a onceflooded street in Fort Lauderdale exactly one week after the recordsetting rainfall that overwhelmed Broward County. The city created a plan called Fortify Fort Lauderdale. Its described by the mayor as an aggressive attempt to improve the infrastructure in the city, prevent backflow from canals, use pumps to push out water and replace or reline old pipes that currently leak. In addition to those plans, a new water treatment plant is in the works. Everything is expected to be completed in the next ten years. The money is going to come from different funds from state and federal grants along with taxpayer dollars, Trantalis said. The city is also focusing on the homeless problem downtown. We cant criminalize homelessness, we cant put someone in jail just because they are homeless, Trantalis said. Number one, it doesnt work, and its not helping the problem. City leaders are now working to identify their needs and connect them to services. A lot of young people are moving to our city now. A lot of retirees continue to move into our city.

Aprs une enqute approfondie sur les inondations qui se produisent rgulirement dans les soussols des proprits de River Lane LOrignal, le service des travaux publics a remis un rapport au conseil du canton de Champlain. Le rapport a t reu lors de la runion ordinaire du 28 septembre et contient plusieurs recommandations pour rsoudre le problme, bases sur les conclusions dEVB Engineering, la socit retenue pour identifier la cause des inondations et compiler des solutions. La premire recommandation consiste demander au ministre de lEnvironnement, de la Conservation et des Parcs MECP dabaisser la limite de dbordement de la station de pompage des eaux uses de la rue King. Il est galement recommand que les travaux publics poursuivent les rparations des infiltrations sur le rseau dgouts en utilisant les mthodes actuelles de rparation ponctuelle, dans le cas de petites rparations durgence, ou didentification par tlvision en circuit ferm, et en budgtisant les rparations plus importantes pour lanne prochaine. La dernire recommandation est que les travaux publics soient chargs de compiler un rapport, remettre au conseil en 2024, avec dautres options pour rduire la quantit deau extrieure sinfiltrant dans le systme sanitaire. On estime quune demande du MECP prend entre trois et quatre mois. Cornwall Gravel Construction a t contact et a fourni une estimation de 10 000 pour effectuer la modification, mais le dpartement des travaux publics pourrait utiliser lquipement du canton pour effectuer le travail luimme un cot estim 2 000 maximum. La limite de dbordement de la station de pompage est actuellement fixe 46,5 mtres, une limite qui a permis dviter cinq inondations. Lanalyse dEVB Engineering a montr quune limite de 44,65 mtres aurait permis dviter 13 inondations, ce qui signifie que labaissement de la limite de dbordement aurait un effet positif immdiat. En ce qui concerne linfiltration deau extrieure dans le systme sanitaire, la station de pompage de King Street reoit en moyenne trois litres par seconde les jours normaux. Lors de gros orages, ce dbit passe 23 litres par seconde, une augmentation spectaculaire qui prend quatre jours pour revenir la normale, selon le rapport. Sur la base de ce taux de rcupration et du fait que les proprits de River Lane ont continu tre inondes pendant trois jours, le rapport indique que LOrignal ne pourra plus stendre sans rsoudre le problme ou ajouter des stations de pompage supplmentaires. Les grosses temptes et la fonte des neiges sont de plus en plus frquentes en raison du rchauffement climatique, et le problme ne devrait donc pas disparatre.

Le premier ministre indien Narendra Modi a pour sa part affirm quil assurait tout le soutien possible aux personnes affectes. La zone touche, une rgion montagneuse et isole de lHimalaya, se trouve prs de la frontire avec le Npal et la Chine. Le lac Lhonak est situ au pied dun glacier proche du Kangchenjunga, le troisime plus haut sommet du monde. En raison dun barrage en amont qui avait rcemment libr de leau, le niveau de la Tista tait de 4,5 mtres plus lev que la normale, a soulign larme indienne. Ponts dtruits Six ponts ont t dtruits et la route nationale qui relie le Sikkim au reste de lInde a t srieusement endommage, a racont le responsable de la gestion des catastrophes de cet tat, Prabhakar Rai. Une vido diffuse par un porteparole de larme montre un torrent de couleur brune se dverser dans une valle plante de forts, passant sur des routes et emportant des lignes lectriques sur son passage. Sur dautres images partages par les militaires, on voit des immeubles submergs jusquau premier tage dans une ville avec la pointe dune petite grue de chantier qui merge de leau. Des prcipitations intenses ont conduit cette situation catastrophique au Sikkim, o la pluie a dclench une inondation par dbordement dun lac glaciaire, endommag un barrage et caus des pertes en vies humaines , a expliqu Miriam Jackson, une scientifique spcialise dans la surveillance des glaces dans les rgions de lHimalaya. Nous observons que la frquence de ces vnements extrmes augmente mesure que le climat continue de se rchauffer et nous entrane en territoire inconnu , a ajout Mme Jackson, dans un communiqu du Centre international pour le dveloppement intgr des montagnes ICIMOD. Une partie du territoire du Sikkim est revendique par Pkin. Une confrontation mineure , selon New Delhi, avait eu lieu en janvier 2021 entre soldats indiens et chinois sur le col de Naku La qui relie le Sikkim la rgion du Tibet. Des dizaines de milliers de soldats indiens et chinois sont positionns de part et dautre de la longue frontire litigieuse entre lInde et la Chine. Le dernier conflit ouvert dampleur entre les deux pays les plus peupls du monde remonte la guerreclair de 1962, qui avait vu les troupes indiennes tre rapidement battues par larme chinoise. Rester vigilants Dans ltat voisin du Bengale occidental, des personnes ont t vacues des districts de Kalimpong, Darjeeling et Jalpaiguri vers des endroits plus srs. Les inondations et les glissements de terrain sont relativement frquents en Inde et y causent de nombreux dgts, notamment pendant la mousson, de juin septembre. Mais, en octobre, la mousson est dhabitude quasiment termine. Selon les experts, le changement climatique a augment lintensit des temptes tropicales, avec notamment des pluies plus abondantes, provoquant de soudaines inondations. La fonte des glaciers himalayens accrot galement le volume des cours deau tandis que les constructions non rglementes dans les zones sujettes aux inondations peuvent exposer les populations locales des catastrophes.

A flood that burst through a major hydroelectric dam in Indias Himalayan northeast killed at least 31 people, officials said Friday, as icecold water swept through mountain towns, washing away houses and bridges and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes. The flood began shortly after midnight Wednesday, when a glacial lake high in the mountains overflowed after a heavy rainfall. AP PhotoPrakash Adhikari Original Publication Date October 05, 2023 1121 PM NEW DELHI AP Hundreds of rescuers dug through slushy debris and fastflowing, icy water Friday in a search for survivors after a glacial lake overflowed and burst through a dam in Indias Himalayan north, a disaster that many had warned was possible for years. The flood began in the early hours of Wednesday, when water overflowed a mountain lake. It smashed through a major hydroelectric dam downstream and then poured into the valley below, where it killed at least 41 people, carrying bodies kilometers miles away, and forced thousands to flee their homes. It wasnt clear what triggered the deadly flood, the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Experts pointed to intense rain, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon, as possible contributors. But the disaster also underscores a climate dilemma that pits local environmental activists who say dams in the Himalayas are too dangerous against authorities pursuing a national green energy agenda. The design and placement of the 6yearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built. A report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority in 2019 had identified Lhonak Lake as highly vulnerable to flooding that could breach dams and cause extensive damage to life and property. The dams operator, and local agencies responsible for dam safety, did not respond to requests for comment Friday. India is counting on hydroelectric dams to meet ambitious clean energy goals that are part of a global effort to slow climate change. The government aims to increase Indias hydro power by half by 2030, to 70,000 megawatts, and has approved hundreds of new dams across the countrys mountainous north. But the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather, driven in part by climate change, puts many dams and the people living downstream from them at risk. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. Rising temperatures also cause glaciers to melt faster, putting more pressure on dams. A 2016 study found that over a fifth of the 177 dams built close to Himalayan glaciers in five countries were at risk from glacial lakes, including the Teesta 3 dam. We knew that this was coming, said Gyatso Lepcha, general secretary of Affected Citizens of Teesta, an environmental organization based in Sikkim, wrote in a statement that called for a safety review of all dams in the state. The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost 1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operation in 2017. But local activists argued that the dam didnt have enough safety features. Despite being the biggest project in the state, there were no early warning systems installed even though the glacier overflowing was a known risk, said Himanshu Thakkar of the nongovernmental organization South Asian Network for Rivers, Dams and People. Thakkar said authorities failed to apply the lessons from a 2021 dam breach in Himalayan state of Uttarakhand that killed 81 people, allowing an eerily similar disaster to occur. India passed a dam safety law in 2021, but Teesta 3 is not on a list of dams whose safety is monitored by Indias top dam regulator. Indias National Disaster Management Agency said Friday that it plans to set up early warning systems at most of Indias 56 known atrisk glacial lakes. Parts of northern Bangladesh along the Teesta River also flooded Friday as water traveled from Sikkim, local media reported. The waters are expected to rise more, as the countrys weather office forecast possible heavy rains in coming days. In Sikkim, more than 2,000 people were rescued after Wednesdays floods, the state Dsaster Management Authority said, adding that authorities set up 26 relief camps for more than 22,000 people. One soldier was previously reported missing was rescued, and the bodies of seven have been found, state police said. Eleven bridges in the Lachan Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said. The army said it was providing medical aid and phone connectivity to civilians in the areas of Chungthang, Lachung and Lachen, and local media reported that said the army was erecting temporary bridges to bring food to affected areas. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state, and record rains in northern India killed more than 100 people over two weeks in July.

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm.

Thats a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night, Ibrahim said. The miseries of long, drawnout disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report more than half of them in Somalia but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no preemptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in the future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify, said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the reports authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 201621 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically dont differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Genevabased nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring overlapping crises where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10yearold Garima Kumars family.

Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnambased expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasnt involved with the report. When youre desperate, you do things that you normally wouldnt do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they dont have the ability to stand up for themselves, she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become shockresponsive, portable and inclusive, to help children and their families better cope with disasters.

This has caused an ongoing battle with wildfires, destroying the natural environment and making the naturally tectonically active region even more vulnerable to other natural disasters. As Bitton illustrates, when I think about GG231 Risks and Disasters, my big goal is for people to be aware that different locations may have very different disaster risks.","Sadiya Teeple With climate change causing rising temperatures and sea levels, it is important to understand the risks of natural disasters in our area. There has been recent flooding in China, wildfires in Canada, California and Hawaii. Further, there have been hurricanes in the Caribbean and landslides in India. Many factors go into the effect a natural disaster will have on a community. Some variables include the magnitude of the event, landscape of the location hit, amount of resources that a community has, population, protective measures or protocols in place and the amount of government action. Michael Bitton, assistant professor in the faculty of Geography and Environmental Studies, explained in regard to vulnerable communities in the case of natural disasters, These are the people who have less expensive homes, built lower to the ground, on flood plains and therefore far more susceptible to flooding. Though the safety of many communities is trusted in the hands of the local government, they sometimes have external pressures that cause environmental wellbeing and protection of their citizens to come second. For instance, prior to the 2010 catastrophic earthquake in Hati the country faced a dramatic increase in population. Since there was a drastic demand for housing, deforestation occurred in order to build new houses. This had significant environmental impacts. The roots of trees stabilize the soil they are in, so once they are removed the ground is vulnerable to shifts in tectonic plates. This results in disasters such as landslides and earthquakes. The earthquake in Hati led to 190,000 homes destroyed and a quarter million lives lost. There are many lowcost tools accessible to assist in understanding terrains and the effect certain developments will have on them. Steven Roberts, associate professor in the faculty of Geography and Environmental Studies at Laurier, touched on his background in spatial analysis tools, geographic information science and landuse planning. He explained that, there are ways to do this stuff with little resources. You dont have to have big investments to be able to tap into some of the tools. Its whether or not theres support to do that and whether or not the decision making processes are transparent enough to want to know the answers. Often the answers will not be what the people in power want to hear. The effects of climate change can be seen in the wide range of increasing environmental impacts around the world. In California, the rise in temperature has resulted in vegetation drying out quicker and more thoroughly. This has caused an ongoing battle with wildfires, destroying the natural environment and making the naturally tectonically active region even more vulnerable to other natural disasters. Similar to the effects of deforestation in Haiti, Bitton stated that, The elimination of plants makes that landscape far more susceptible to flooding washouts, mudslides, and landslides since all the land that used to be held in place by the roots of the plants, can now erode and tumble down slope much easier. Not only will there be more natural disasters occuring, but they will have a greater impact. With Canadas recent battles against wildfires, the effects of global warming are evident. Just this year, the eastern coast of Canada was hit by Hurricane Lee, a tropical storm that left 170,000 Canadians without power for days. With sea surface temperatures rising and warmer waters coming further north, Canada could be receiving more hurricanes and stronger storms each year. As Bitton illustrates, when I think about GG231 Risks and Disasters, my big goal is for people to be aware that different locations may have very different disaster risks. The big ideas are to understandknow why there are certain risks in certain places so that people can better prepare for their specific vulnerabilities and help the masses, especially the less fortunate, prepare since preparation can decrease the loss of life, if nothing else.",1

At least, thats the strategy First Onsite is taking. The restoration firm intends to mobilize quicker local residential and commercial repairs by opening a new office in the Shawinigan and TroisRivires regions of Qubec, an area prone to flood damage. The firm plans to onboard 15 staff and hire 20 to 40 subcontractors in the first year of its new location. The claims industry is an industry where you cant really plan you have had people on call, Valrie Bouchard, directrice principale, dveloppement des affaires at First Onsite, told Canadian Underwriter. The new local office serving a floodprone area could help make clients repairs happen quicker, she said. We had high demands in Three Rivers, Bouchard told CU. In the past, we wouldnt see big disasters and big rains during the summer. But now we see that. Parts of Qubec saw dangerous flash flooding this July. Weather stations near TroisRivires were reporting rainfall rates over 10 mm an hour north of the St. Lawrence River, the Weather Network reported. In the spring of 2017, spring snowfall and heavy rain caused floods across Quebec, including Shawinigan and TroisRivires. Floodwater washed out portions of Route 155 and flooded residences, causing regions to declare states of emergency. Heavy rain is forecast this weekend in the region of Mauricie, north of TroisRivires. Precipitation could range from 50 mm to 80 mm on Friday and Saturday. The federal government warns water accumulation could be significant on roads and in lowlying areas. But the general restoration industry is facing a shortage of available and qualified talent. This talent shortage, coupled with supply chain issues, has caused longer cycle times for largescale repairs, although it was worse before, Bouchard said. TroisRivires is the next step in the restoration firms expansion plans, enabling the company to respond quickly to its clients major restoration projects. The region is home to commercial clients spanning from retirement homes, to manufacturing, transportation and logistics industries. The firm does have offices in Montral and Qubec City, but until the new office opened, they didnt have anything in the middle. In order to act very quickly for those clients who give us a lot of work during the year, it was so much easier to have an office there, so we will have people on location to do everything, Bouchard said. Having an office in between the two major cities will save recovery teams about oneandahalf hours worth of response time when they need to be onsite, Bouchard explained.

The city received 56 mm of rainfall, with higher amounts recorded in certain areas. The floods affected various parts of the city, including newly constructed flyovers. Ferry services were suspended, and a cricket match was washed out. The India Meteorological Department issued a warning of thunderstorms and heavy rain in the region until October 4. Civic body to renovate 1.3km stormwater drain The Cuttack Municipal Corporation CMC in India has planned to renovate a secondary storm water drain in the city. The 1.3 km drain, built in 1987, is meant to clear rainwater during monsoons but often gets clogged with waste and garbage. The renovation project, estimated to cost Rs 82.29 crore, will include a concrete base and a 20fthigh concrete wall. Barricades will also be placed to prevent entry of animals and people. Construction is expected to begin in November and be completed within a year. Nod to silt removal in Derabassi The Punjab government has allowed farmers in Mohali to remove sand from their agricultural fields due to a change in the course of the Ghaggars river. This decision provides relief to farmers who were previously unable to remove the sand due to strict policies. Farmers have until October 5 to remove the sand, following standard operating procedures. The disposal of the sand will be done through district mining officers via auction. This move aims to support farmers affected by floods and facilitate agricultural activities. GUWAHATI The five narrowed rivulets that carry stormwater of the entire city due to rapid urbanisation, depletion of forest as well as tree cover and encroachment across the 18 hills in Guwahati over the decades are the reasons behind the worsening urban floods over the years, experts said.A retired professor of Gauhati University , who did indepth studies on urban floods, said Guwahati witnessed heavy changes particularly in the last over four decades after the human settlement increased in the city following the shifting of the capital from Shillong to Dispur in 197273.With the increase in human settlement, forest cover decreased, urbanisation was rapid and rivulets lost the capacity to carry stormwater. People will have to abandon the city soon if the government does not formulate a concrete policy to save it as priority and the city dwellers do not join hands with the government, the retired professor said.IIT Guwahati professor for water resources of the department of civil engineering, Arup Kumar Sarma, said desilting the drains by the Guwahati Municipal Corporation alone cannot solve the worsening urban floods in the city until scientific measures, like placing debris control screen and creating silting basin at the inlet point of the drains, are not adopted by the government.He said apart from adopting ecological management practices like increasing grassland, tree cover and vegetation, steps to prevent waste and sediment going into the drains should also be taken.He said creating a silting basin at the confluence of the primary and secondary drains can also be an effective way to curb sedimentation as the basin will curb the velocity of flow and deposition of silt at the basin.Sarma in a research paper published a few years ago said optimal ecological management practices like increasing grassland, tree cover, vegetation and construction of detention drains should be followed to mitigate floods.We also published the following articles recently",1

The flood began in the early hours of Wednesday, when water overflowed a mountain lake. It smashed through a major hydroelectric dam downstream and then poured into the valley below, where it killed at least 41 people and forced thousands to flee their homes. Police said that 22 of the dead were found kilometres miles downriver in West Bengal state, while 100 people are still missing. The disaster underscores a climate dilemma thats pitted local environmental activists who say the dams are too dangerous against authorities pursuing a national green energy agenda for years. It wasnt clear what triggered the deadly flood, the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Experts pointed to intense rain, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon, as possible contributors. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. But the design and placement of the sixyearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built as part of an Indian push to expand hydropower energy. Local activists argued that the location was too dangerous and that the dam didnt include enough safety measures. A report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority in 2019 had identified Lhonak Lake as highly vulnerable to flooding that could breach dams and cause extensive damage to life and property. The dams operator, and local agencies responsible for dam safety, did not respond to requests for comment Friday. Rising temperatures cause glaciers to melt faster, making dam failures and catastrophic floods more likely, but India is counting on such dams to meet its ambitious clean energy goals. The government aims to increase Indias hydroelectric dam output by half, to 70,000 megawatts, by 2030, and has approved hundreds of new hydroelectric dams to be built across the Himalayan region. But the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather, driven in part by climate change, puts many dams and the people living downstream from them at risk. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. A 2016 study found that over a fifth of the 177 dams built close to Himalayan glaciers could fail if glacial lakes burst, including the Teesta 3 dam. We knew that this was coming, said Gyatso Lepcha, general secretary of Affected Citizens of Teesta, an environmental organisation based in Sikkim. The same can happen with other dams also, he wrote in a statement that called for a safety review of all dams in the state. The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost US1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operation in 2017. Despite being the biggest project in the state, there were no early warning systems installed even though the glacier overflowing was a known risk, said Himanshu Thakkar of the nongovernmental organization South Asian Network for Rivers, Dams and People. Thakkar said authorities failed to apply the lessons from a 2021 dam breach in Himalayan state of Uttarakhand that killed 81 people, allowing an eerily similar disaster to occur. Indias National Disaster Management Agency said Friday that it plans to set up early warning systems at most of Indias 56 known atrisk glacial lakes.",1

AP Nearly three months after severe flooding inundated Vermonts capital city, Montpelier businesses launched an event Friday to celebrate how much theyve rebuilt and remind the public not to forget them as they struggle to make a complete comeback. The small city of about 8,000 is celebrating its ongoing recovery with food trucks, music and street performers in hopes of drawing visitors downtown and giving shops a chance to sell their merchandise in sidewalk sales.

AP PhotoLisa Rathke Rain will likely fall at times during the twoday event, although Trautz said a weather forecaster has assured organizers that heavy rains will likely be west of the city. Trautz said at least 125 Montpelier businesses were damaged in the July flooding that filled basements and lower floors of businesses with water and obscured vehicles and all but the tops of parking meters downtown. Some resident canoed and kayaked along main streets, while others slogged through the waisthigh water to survey the scene. Since then, 15 to 20 businesses have reopened and 10 have officially closed, Trautz said. She estimates that 80 will reopen but it will take a long time. What were trying to do is also give businesses an opportunity to sell their merchandise and be recognized and keep the attention on Montpelier because this is not over, Trautz said. She also noted that the fall, a popular time for tourists who flock to the state to see colorful foliage, is when businesses traditionally make the money that gets them through the end of the year. The celebration includes an art walk on Friday evening, the farmers market on Saturday morning, and the Taste of Montpelier Food Festival in the afternoon with 20 food trucks offering fare from around Vermont. A singing group will hold a benefit for Montpelier flood relief on the Statehouse lawn on Saturday afternoon and the Kellogg Hubbard Library will celebrate its own grand reopening with crafts, snacks, and the finale of its fundraising auction.

Tourist arrivals over the eightday break that ended Friday reached more than 932,000, taking the daily average to about 84 of 2019s in the same period, according to official data from the city. About 76 of the visitors were from mainland China, the data show. Visitors were spending big, too. Gaming revenue from massmarket tourists, now the biggest driver of Macau casinos growth following Chinas crackdown on highrollers, is likely to have fully recovered to prepandemic levels, according to estimates by Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Co. Mass gaming income may reach about 110 of the 2019 level next year, driving casinos profits to a full recovery by mid2024, according to a JPMorgan estimate last month. Macaus boom highlights Chinas surging tourism demand, fueled by revenge travel and a shift in consumer preferences to more experiencerelated spending in response to an economic slowdown at home. The latter coincides with the hubs efforts to wean itself off its reliance on highrollers and their facilitators and transform into an entertainment hub akin to the Las Vegas Strip.

New York City does not wait for a storm to prepare we are already several steps ahead, said Mayor Adams. Our emergency management teams, first responders, and key city agencies are fully activated and tightly coordinated to face the coming rains headon. I urge every New Yorker especially those in areas more susceptible to flooding to stay alert by signing up for Notify NYC now. We have activated the Flash Flood Emergency Plan in anticipation of heavy rainfall as we head into the weekend, said NYCEM Commissioner Iscol. Our primary concern is a sixhour period of moderate to heavy rain late Friday night through early Saturday afternoon. While widespread, major impacts are not expected, I want to stress the vital need for all New Yorkers, especially those in lowlying and floodprone areas, including belowgrade living spaces, to take precautions, sign up for emergency notifications via Notify NYC, pay attention to changes in the forecast, and heed official guidance to keep yourselves and your loved ones safe. The National Weather Service has issued a Flood Watch citywide, effective Saturday from 200 AM until 800 PM. Moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms are forecast to begin late Friday night through Saturday afternoon, with a few inches of rain expected over a roughly sixhour period. Locally, upwards of four inches of rainfall is possible. Where the heaviest rainfall rates develop, flooding could be locally significant causing disruption to transportation flooding of basements, firstfloor residences and businesses, and underground infrastructure and posing an elevated threat to life. Lowlying, poor drainage and frequent flood locations may be especially vulnerable. Widespread, major impacts are not expected. Lingering showers may continue into early Saturday evening, with dry conditions expected by Saturday night. Breezy winds develop Saturday afternoon, with a few gusts likely Sunday. Temperatures will cool into the upper 40s by Monday morning. Safety Tips Allow for extra travel time. New Yorkers are urged to use public transportation. If you must drive, drive slowly. Use major streets or highways for travel whenever possible. If you live in a basement apartment in a floodprone area, prepare to move to a place higher than the flood waters if experiencing rising waters andor if you receive a warning from Notify NYC or the National Weather Service. Do not drive into flooded streets or enter flooded subway stations. Six inches of moving water can knock over an adult. Avoid stepping in floodwater if you see it. Check on friends, relatives, and neighbors, especially older adults as well as people with disabilities, access and functional needs, or health conditions. Help them to prepare if needed. Stay informed. Before and during an emergency, the city will send emergency alerts and updates to New Yorkers through various channels, including Notify NYC. Sign up for emergency notifications on the Notify NYC website at govNotifyNYC or call 311. You can also follow NotifyNYC on social media. New Yorkers should follow the National Weather Service forecast and guidance listed in watches, warnings, and advisories on the National Weather Service website.

UNICEF recorded the most weatherrelated child displacements in the East Asia and Pacific region due to the combination of hazards there, followed by South Asia. Among the countries with the highest in absolute numbers were China and the Philippines, due to their exposure to extreme weather events, their large child populations and evacuation capacities. As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climatedriven movement, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement. We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly. Extreme weather events have become more common in recent years due to climate change. Floods and storms accounted for 95per cent of the child displacements, said UNICEF, during the sixyear period, according to its report, Children Displaced in a Changing Climate. The displacement of children is barely on the radar of leaders, said Verena Knaus, UNICEF Global Lead on Migration and Displacement.

Parts of northern Bangladesh along the Teesta River also flooded Friday as water traveled from Sikkim, local media reported.","NEW DELHI AP Hundreds of rescuers dug through slushy debris and fastflowing, icy water Friday in a search for survivors after a glacial lake overflowed and burst through a dam in Indias Himalayan north, a disaster that many had warned was possible for years. The flood began in the early hours of Wednesday, when water overflowed a mountain lake. It smashed through a major hydroelectric dam downstream and then poured into the valley below, where it killed at least 41 people, carrying bodies miles downstream, and forced thousands to flee their homes. It wasnt clear what triggered the deadly flood, the latest to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Experts pointed to intense rain, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon, as possible contributors. But the disaster also underscores a climate dilemma that pits local environmental activists who say dams in the Himalayas are too dangerous against authorities pursuing a national green energy agenda. The design and placement of the 6yearold Teesta 3 dam, the largest in Sikkim state, were controversial from the time it was built. A report compiled by the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority in 2019 had identified Lhonak Lake as highly vulnerable to flooding that could breach dams and cause extensive damage to life and property. The dams operator, and local agencies responsible for dam safety, did not respond to requests for comment Friday. India is counting on hydroelectric dams to meet ambitious clean energy goals that are part of a global effort to slow climate change. The government aims to increase Indias hydro power by half by 2030, to 70,000 megawatts, and has approved hundreds of new dams across the countrys mountainous north. But the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather, driven in part by climate change, puts many dams and the people living downstream from them at risk. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. Rising temperatures also cause glaciers to melt faster, putting more pressure on dams. A 2016 study found that over a fifth of the 177 dams built close to Himalayan glaciers in five countries were at risk from glacial lakes, including the Teesta 3 dam. We knew that this was coming, said Gyatso Lepcha, general secretary of Affected Citizens of Teesta, an environmental organization based in Sikkim, wrote in a statement that called for a safety review of all dams in the state. The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost 1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operation in 2017. But local activists argued that the dam didnt have enough safety features. Despite being the biggest project in the state, there were no early warning systems installed even though the glacier overflowing was a known risk, said Himanshu Thakkar of the nongovernmental organization South Asian Network for Rivers, Dams and People. Thakkar said authorities failed to apply the lessons from a 2021 dam breach in Himalayan state of Uttarakhand that killed 81 people, allowing an eerily similar disaster to occur. India passed a dam safety law in 2021, but Teesta 3 is not on a list of dams whose safety is monitored by Indias top dam regulator. Indias National Disaster Management Agency said Friday that it plans to set up early warning systems at most of Indias 56 known atrisk glacial lakes. Parts of northern Bangladesh along the Teesta River also flooded Friday as water traveled from Sikkim, local media reported. The waters are expected to rise more, as the countrys weather office forecast possible heavy rains in coming days. In Sikkim, more than 2,000 people were rescued after Wednesdays floods, the state Dsaster Management Authority said, adding that authorities set up 26 relief camps for more than 22,000 people. One soldier was previously reported missing was rescued, and the bodies of seven have been found, state police said. Eleven bridges in the Lachan Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said. The army said it was providing medical aid and phone connectivity to civilians in the areas of Chungthang, Lachung and Lachen, and local media reported that said the army was erecting temporary bridges to bring food to affected areas. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state, and record rains in northern India killed more than 100 people over two weeks in July.

Nathan Cullen chatted with a crew from Ksik GeoSpatial Aerial Survey Company who had flown two of their planes to the Williams Lake Regional Airport to meet with him. Cullen said the project will give communities, First Nations and everyone the kind of information needed to be able to plan for flooding, fires, conservation, old growth protection and resource development. Im just so proud, he said. Initially a flyover of Williams Lake was planned for the minister, but the weather prevented that from happening. Instead, Cullen joined Ksik chief pilot and operations manager Robyn Stewart and acquisitions manager Corey Newton inside one of the planes to see the instruments and learn more about LiDAR. Stewart has been a commercial pilot since 2000. She has done survey flying since 2006 and flown for Ksik since 2011. Newton said they began the project at the end of August and anticipate it will take about four years to complete it. Covering over 950,000 square kilometres the LiDAR project is the biggest of its kind. The only other one that I could find was in France, Newton said. They did about 500,000 square kilometres, but the majority of it is pretty flat and nonmountainous. We got our work cut out for us for sure. Its ambitious. Newton said the project will give everyone a common point of data and from that information communities might decide they want to have further study done of a specific area. Cullen said many communities are telling government, including in the Cariboo, their 200yearflood zone does not feel like a 200year flood zone anymore, that hydrology is changing and flooding is changing and asked if the project will help with that. Responding, Newton said the precision and accuracy combined of LiDAR can give more information than photographs can. After meeting with the crew he said he could feel the pride of the folks working on the project, what it means for B.C. and for the world. Presently, the province makes a large collection of LiDAR data that accounts for 14 per cent of B.C.s landscape free and equally accessible to everyone on the LidarBC website. New LiDAR data sourced from Ksik will significantly update the provinces digital models of landscapes that are based on aerial imagery taken 30 years ago, and will include detailed representations of forests, buildings and other infrastructure, noted a news release from the Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship. The program will initially concentrate on gathering data for rural areas and other areas of the province that are not currently represented in the LidarBC database. In April 2023, the province announced 38 million in support for the new program.

The location backs onto Silver Creek Conservation Area and the plantings will help create connectivity and a corridor for wildlife, says the CVC. An educational sign will be installed later this year to commemorate the project and inform visitors about the mini forest. There are many benefits of mini forests, said Deborah Kenley, senior coordinator of Greening Corporate Grounds for CVC. Mini forests capture carbon quicker, generate shade which helps to cool our cities, provide food and shelter for wildlife, and reduce flood risk by absorbing rainwater. Popularized by Japanese botanist, Akira Miyawaki, mini forests are small, dense plantings of many different native tree and shrub species. The technique mimics natural forest conditions and encourages faster growth. The forests can reach maturity in as little as 20 years traditional plantations can take 100 to 200 years. A minimum of 100 square metres is needed for the plantings. According to the CVC, establishing new forests or growth tends to be more successful when trees are planted together to form communities. The mini forest method of planting tightly encourages the fast upward growth of trees towards the sun, while shrubs add diversity and supports healthy habitat.

Children Displaced in a Changing Climate is the first global analysis of the number of children driven from their homes between 2016 and 2021 due to floods, storms, droughts and wildfires, and looks at projections for the next 30 years. According to the analysis, China and the Philippines are among the countries that recorded the highest absolute numbers of child displacements, due to their exposure to extreme weather, large child populations and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. However, relative to the size of the child population, children living in small island states, such as Dominica and Vanuatu, were most affected by storms, while children in Somalia and South Sudan were most affected by floods. It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community, said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but its also very disruptive. As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climatedriven movement. We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly. We need to strengthen efforts to prepare communities, protect children at risk of displacement, and support those already uprooted. Floods and storms accounted for 40.9 million or 95 per cent of recorded child displacements between 2016 and 2021, due in part to better reporting and more preemptive evacuations. Meanwhile, droughts triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children with Somalia again among the most affected, while wildfires triggered 810,000 child displacements, with more than a third occurring in 2020 alone. Canada, Israel and the United States recorded the most. Decisions to move can be forced and abrupt in the face of disaster, or as the result of preemptive evacuation, where lives may be saved but many children still face the dangers and challenges that come with being uprooted from their homes, often for extended periods. Children are especially at risk of displacement in countries already grappling with overlapping crises, such as conflict and poverty, where local capacities to cope with any additional displacements of children are strained. Haiti, for example already at high risk of disasterrelated child displacement is also plagued by violence and poverty, with limited investment in risk mitigation and preparedness. While in Mozambique, it is the poorest communities, including those in urban areas, that are disproportionately affected by extreme weather. These are the countries where the number of vulnerable children at risk of future displacement is the greatest and coping capacities and financing is limited where risk mitigation, adaptation, preparedness efforts and financing are most urgent. Using a disaster displacement risk model developed by Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, the report projects riverine floods have the potential to displace almost 96 million children over the next 30 years, based on current climate data, while cyclonic winds and storm surges have the potential to displace 10.3 million and 7.2 million children respectively, over the same period. With more frequent and more severe weather events as consequence of changing climate, the actual numbers will almost certainly be higher. UNICEF works with governments in countries most at risk to better prepare for and minimise the risk of displacement, develop and implement childresponsive disaster risk reduction climate change adaptation strategies, and design resilient and portable services to protect and reach children before, during and after disaster strikes, catering solutions to address contextspecific vulnerabilities. As leaders prepare to meet at the COP28 Climate Change Summit in Dubai in November, UNICEF urges governments, donors, development partners, and the private sector to take the following actions to protect children and young people at risk of future displacement and prepare them and their communities PROTECT children and young people from the impacts of climate changeexacerbated disasters and displacement by ensuring that childcritical services including education, health, nutrition, social protection and child protection services are shockresponsive, portable and inclusive, including for those already uprooted from their homes. children and young people from the impacts of climate changeexacerbated disasters and displacement by ensuring that childcritical services including education, health, nutrition, social protection and child protection services are shockresponsive, portable and inclusive, including for those already uprooted from their homes.

PRIORITIZE children and young people including those already uprooted from their homes in disaster and climate action and finance, humanitarian and development policy, and investments to prepare for a future already happening. Notes to Editors Because the definition of the hazards considered in the projections are different to those in the historic analysis it is not possible to directly compare the two. The projections also do not include preemptive evacuations.

Les ruptures sont trs imprvisibles, parce quelles peuvent tre causes par un grand nombre de facteurs diffrents, atelle ajout. Quel est limpact du changement climatique Le changement climatique entrane la disparition des glaciers. La moiti des 215 000 glaciers de la plante devrait fondre dici la fin du sicle, mme si le rchauffement peut tre plafonn 1,5 degr Celsius. Le volume des lacs glaciaires a bondi de 50 en 30 ans, selon une tude de 2020 base sur des donnes satellite. Plus les lacs se forment et plus ils sont grands, plus ils reprsentent un risque pour les populations en aval. Le changement climatique nentrane pas seulement la cration de lacs glaciaires, mais peut galement crer des conditions entranant des ruptures de barrages. Les inondations peuvent tre causes par la fonte des glaciers ou par des fortes prcipitations. Nous savons que cela se produit davantage cause du changement climatique, relve Lauren Vargo. Quelle est la dangerosit de ces crues Le danger spcifique aux crues des lacs glaciaires est li leur imprvisibilit. La probabilit quun lac libre une crue subite est difficile quantifier avec prcision sans tudes dtailles et localises, avertit une tude internationale consacre cette anne au sujet. Ltude, publie dans Nature Communications, indique que 15 millions de personnes vivent moins de 50 kilomtres dun lac glaciaire et moins dun kilomtre dune inondation potentielle due une brche. Le risque le plus lev se rencontre dans les hautes montagnes dAsie, une zone qui couvre partiellement 12 pays dont lInde, le Pakistan, la Chine et le Npal. Cela sexplique en partie par le fait que davantage dhabitants vivent proximit des lacs glaciaires dans la rgion que dans dautres parties du monde, ce qui rend les dlais dalerte encore plus courts. Mais cela reflte galement la vulnrabilit de ces populations, qui peuvent tre plus pauvres et moins prpares faire face larrive soudaine de crues catastrophiques. voir aussi",1

The resistance in Gaza reports taking dozens of hostages including Brigadier General Nimrod Aloni. The operation, called AlAqsa Flood, was launched on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war in which Egypt reclaimed the occupied Sinai from Zionist occupation, and is set to alter the direction of the struggle in occupied Palestine, moving from resistance toward revolution and liberation, the organization writes. It explains that the resistance operation comes in response to the ongoing stream of crimes against the Palestinian people, the daily murder of Palestinians on the streets of the West Bank of occupied Palestine, the siege on Gaza, the theft of land for settlements, the denial of refugees right to return, imposing exile for over 75 years, the torture and attacks on the Palestinian prisoners, the ongoing invasions of AlAqsa Mosque, and the 75 years of Zionist occupation and over 100 years of imperialist domination and colonialism throughout occupied Palestine. It also comes to bring about the liberation of Palestinian prisoners, as part and parcel of the Palestinian people and land. Samidoun continues It is a decisive rebuke to the entire path of Oslo and normalization imposed upon the Palestinian and Arab people for the past 50 years, indicating a new path forward with a clear goal liberation, and nothing less. It builds upon the liberation of south Lebanon from occupation by the Lebanese resistance, led by Hezbollah, in 2000, and the defeat of the Zionist invasion of Lebanon in 2006, as well as the successive heroic battles waged by the Palestinian resistance throughout occupied Palestine and especially from its base area of resistance land in Gaza. Samidoun joins the Masar Badil, the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement, in calling the masses of our Palestinian people, supporters of the resistance in exile and diaspora, allies from the liberation forces and movements, and solidarity committees with the Palestinian people everywhere, to express their support for the heroic Palestinian resistance, raise the flag of Palestine and the banners of resistance, and organize popular, political and media demonstrations and events to expose the Zionist crimes against our people in occupied Palestine the resistance has announced that it has taken a significant number of prisoners from among the occupation soldiers and settlers in order to liberate the 5,250 Palestinian prisoners in occupation prisons, including the 1,350 jailed without charge or trial under administrative detention, 39 women and 170 children. The Masar Badil, the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement called on its organizations and supporters, the masses of our Palestinian people, supporters of the resistance in exile and diaspora, allies from the liberation forces and movements, and solidarity committees with the Palestinian people everywhere, to express their support for the heroic Palestinian resistance, raise the flag of Palestine and the banners of resistance, and organize popular, political and media demonstrations and events to expose the Zionist crimes against our people in occupied Palestine, and to support the AlAqsa Flood operation announced by the CommanderinChief of the Izz alDin alQassam Brigades the military wing of Hamas, Brother Mohammed alDeif. The heroic Palestinian resistance has opened a chapter of battles of dignity and pride at the dawn of October 7, 2023, and it is now responding to decades of continuous and repeated Zionist, American and European aggression against the masses of our Arab and Islamic nation. Hamas said more than 7,000 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel, declaring it had started Operation AlAqsa Flood. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance movement also said its fighters have joined the operation as Hamas called on Palestinians everywhere to fight and on resistance groups in Lebanon to join the fighting against Israel. Israel responded with massive air strikes deep inside the coastal enclave, killing scores and wounding hundreds of people and vowing unprecedented retaliation.Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. We are in a war and we will win it. Gaza health officials said at least 232 Palestinians had been killed and more than 1,697 injured, and carried into crumbling and overcrowded hospitals with severe shortages of medical supplies and equipment. According to Israeli media, at least 200 Israelis have been killed and over 1,100 injured following the largescale operation. The Israel regime has cut electricity to the Gaza Strip as it intensifies its attacks against the besieged Palestinian territory. The regimes energy minister said he ordered the staterun electricity company to halt power supply to the Gaza Strip on Saturday. I have signed an order instructing Israel Electric Company to stop the electricity supply to Gaza, Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. Power outages have long been an everyday occurrence in Gaza and households only had electricity for several hours a day on a rotational basis on the days before recent power cuts started. Gazas power authority says 80 per cent of the electricity supplies to Gaza from the national grid have been cut off following Israels announcement. The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel, UN Human Rights Commission in its recent report September 2023 concluded that Israel has violated and continues to violate the right of the Palestinian people to selfdetermination by its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. The legal consequence of the violation of right to selfdetermination, which is an obligation erga omnes toward all, is the responsibility of the State of Israel. The current occupation, which has lasted 56 years to date, is unlawful under international law. The result of the unlawful acts entails legal consequences for Israel to bring an end to the internationally wrongful act.40 All States and the UN are also under an obligation to act urgently to bring the unlawful acts to an end.

Story continues below advertisement It was terrifying, just sitting at work, not knowing what was going on. I was on edge all day, she said. She has now turned her grief into action, raising money that she said will be going toward rebuilding schools and hospitals in the devastated region. Were just hoping to give them as much as we can so they are able to have those services, Lahlou said. Education is very important. The children are the future and the hope, and we are hoping they are the generations that will lift up the country. Lahlou works at the Cariboo Chilcotin Child Development Centre with a serious passion for education and students. 326 Morocco earthquake Survivors continue to sleep outdoors in makeshift shelters, 5 days after tragedy The federal government matched donations to the Canadian Red Cross to help Morocco recover from the devastating earthquake in midSeptember. Story continues below advertisement Global Affairs Canada said the money is being used to help the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement deliver lifesaving services, such as emergency food, water, emergency cash and vouchers, as well as sanitation and health services. Another 2 million in federal assistance was provided for immediate needs.",1

It is being republished here for readers who may have missed it. Brad Collar has been throwing axes since he was a young boy. Reminiscing on his earliest years, the Sault resident has fond memories of spending enjoyable afternoons out in the country throwing fullsized axes into the side of his grandfathers garage. Wed do it on the side of the garage until my grandfather put boards up and he had to fix the siding, Collar chuckled. Wed have a good time. Decades later, the now father of two has reignited his passion for the target striking sport and hes inviting the community to give it a try at his new eastend business. Called Soo Axe Throwing, the new MacDonald Avenue establishment provides locals of all ages with the chance to test their axe throwing skills. Its something physical, something fun, something different, he says. A lot of people havent seen it. Before participants begin throwing, they will sign a waiver, be given a rundown on safety, and then be provided a demonstration on how to throw the axe. Working at Bath Fitter by day, Collar says this is the first time hes opened his own storefront business and sensed there was a demand for this kind of leisure activity in town. I had been to some of the ones in Sudbury and down in Mackinaw, and theres nothing here in the Sault that was like it, he told SooToday. Twenty some years ago we used to have everything here go carts, mini golf it all seems to be leaving. It just made sense to do something here. Celebrating his grand opening last Saturday, Collar has already seen a variety of demographics come through the facility, including higher numbers in women which is nice to see according to the owner. He also hosted a kids birthday party on Sunday and affirmed that axe throwing really is for everyone. Pretty much anyone can do it, he says. Ive had kids in here at eight and nine years old throwing them for birthday parties. They just need a parent or guardian for the insurance waivers. We also have the plastic sets, and there are Velcro ones we can set up too. Four or fiveyearolds can play with them. Everybody thats been coming has been having a good time. Everybody who shows up so far has been coming back too. Axe throwers also have the option of choosing from several different types of axes that meet their specific needs, ranging from one and a half to two and a half pounds in weight. Some are lighter than the other ones, we have some heavier ones, and then there are some really heavy ones, Collar says. Quite a bit of research went into it to find axes that were going to last. There are specific ones that throw better and rotate properly. We also use the end grain style boards so its easier to get the axes in. Its a lot more fun youre not dropping them every time. Starting in December, the axe expert says hell begin offering knife throwing as well. Collar is also planning to build a mobile axe throwing trailer, which he intends to bring to city events like Bon Soo, Canada Day, and Rotaryfest. Residents looking to test their axe throwing abilities can book a spot by emailing email protected, calling 7055750293, or by messaging Soo Axe Throwing on social media.

The change has already had a big impact on her business, affecting between 25 and 50 per cent of her bottom line, she said. However, changing Cold Comforts ingredients to meet the provincial legislation is not possible for her. According to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, there are legal requirements in place in the food industry to help prevent foodborne illness. Island Health, which is responsible for enforcing the rules, said in a statement that they have been working with this business for a number of months to support them into coming into compliance. B.C. Agriculture and Food Minister Pam Alexis told Global News the government is looking at ways to adhere to all of the safety measures that are in place to protect people, but try to make it easier for small businesses like Cold Comfort to operate. Maxwell said she would love to have that conversation with the government. In the meantime, she can still sell the treat from her storefront, thanks to an exemption for small producers under the Milk Industry Act. 2023 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.",1

And you better believe that kisses go by favour. If you are in Opposition, you and your people are salt. BY DEFAULT Thank God for Bruce Golding who instituted the muchmaligned Constituency Development Fund. But that has its own limits and bureaucracy. When the likes of Doris needed immediate relief, you used your own money until there was none left. The default position is to get hard of heart to be missing in action limiting the time of exposure to the very people you want to be with or to suck up to some boops who will finance constituency needs at a price. Now, with the much bigger money MPs get, ask any of them it only means the requests and demands are greater and more insistent. Jamaica has no social security system equal to the needs of the increasing number of poor. The elected representative is held responsible for everything has more dash but less power to get things done than the bureaucrat in any State department. Ask any of them about the road rehabilitation programme which has been promised months ago, thereby raising immediate expectations among constituents, but is yet to be implemented. And you cant complain too loudly either because, if you are a government member, you will be considered disloyal and subtly victimised, while if your party is in Opposition, you are presumed to be more presumptions and impertinent than Oliver Twist. MAKING GOOD LAWS Then come to Gordon House on Tuesday afternoon and participate in the exercise of passing just laws for the public weal. The agenda is entirely determined by the House Leader and the capacity to intervene meaningfully is subject to a usually partisan Speaker who takes her cue from the said House Leader. Oh for a Speaker like the independentminded and supercalm Michael Peart During my time, I asked scores of questions and introduced many more private members motions than anyone else mostly to no avail. It makes me wince when I hear one of these latterday Speakers proclaim their fidelity to the standing orders which are breached flagrantly by them at every sitting. My questions and motions were never rejected for irrelevance though Pearnel sometimes tried to edit them to make the government not look so bad, but most fell off the order paper at the end of a term, never given a chance to be debated. My zeal was considered a nuisance. Most other members never bothered to try. The standing orders provide for a Thursday sitting to accommodate private members business. But when has that ever been implemented and which quorum is going to turn up on that day of the week anyway THE NIA REVIEW No wonder Jeanette Calder at JAMP could record 294 reports tabled by state agencies spending tens of billions of the dollars extracted from persons like Doris, but never examined except in one deggedegge committee meeting over the period. This is bald truth which should outrage everyone. There is no effective oversight of public expenditure by the legislature. No wonder people make it a virtue to evade taxes. In fact both Trevor Munroe and JAMP were much too mild in their critique of parliamentary oversight. I fought for the reestablishment of the Public Administration Appropriations Committee at the turn of the century. This has proved such an embarrassment to a slack government that it is proposed that this Committee should be restricted to consider only to those matters referred to it by the whole House. The Public Accounts Committee only works in arrears and only when provoked by some auditorgenerals report. And, after all the publicity, what becomes of their recommendations The Standing Finance Committee is scandalously useless. Any searching questions of budget items are routinely shouted down. Members show little or no interest in interrogating the efficiency of the trillion and more dollars presented in the big yellow book by the Finance Ministry. So NIA and JAMP may have reason to balance their inventory of deficiencies with their acknowledgement of slight successes. It could be even worse. Their effort is highly commendable. Without their kind of oversight, arrogance, recklessness and corruption would prevail unchecked. WEAK COMMITTEE STRUCTURE Then there were the interminable hours spent in sessional committees. Meetings are irregular because facilities and staff are said to be limited. This government has neutered committees into near extinction by their fear of Opposition chairpersons. The public and interest groups are heard, reports are written, most of which never influence policy or legislation. A cruel example is my fruitless effort over two decades to require the names of all fathers to be recorded on their childrens birth certificates. IS IT WORTH IT Each candidate in the upcoming elections must ask themselves if the effort at representation is worth it. Those who conclude that it is must resolve to radically change the capacities and accountability of the present order. Our governance arrangements are broken full of form and too empty of substance. Autocracy thrives. The present system produces elected eunuchs. Rev Ronald G. Thwaites is an attorneyatlaw. He is former member of parliament for Kingston Central and was the minister of education. He is the principal of St Michaels College at the UWI. Send feedback to columnsgleanerjm.com.",1

The next council meeting will take place on Wednesday, Oct. 4 at 5 p.m.","Municipality provides inkind assistance in liaising with nearby residents North Cowichan council met for 5 12 hours during its regular meeting and public hearing on Sept. 26. North Cowichan Mayor Rob Douglas report included the following updates Earlier this month, Chief James Thomas from the Halalt Nation invited Councillor Debra Toporowski and I to join a meeting with the Minister of Emergency Management Climate Change Readiness, Bowinn Ma, to discuss the need for provincial funding for additional flood mitigation works along the Chemainus River, including to stabilize the right bank downstream from the TransCanada Highway bridge. Shortly after this meeting, work began to remove about 8,500 cubic metres of sediment from a gravel bar between the Chemainus Road Bridge and the E N railway bridge on the Chemainus River. The work is being funded by the Province and managed by their consultant, KWL, with North Cowichan providing inkind assistance in liaising with nearby residents, documentation reviews and related support to the project. Halalt Nation is an integral part of the project, supporting the work and facilitating the contract with local company Stone Pacific. Sharing of the gravel was agreed upon with the affected landowners, who are donating about half of the material for municipal use and half to the Halalt Nation. In September, North Cowichan council joined more than 2,000 elected officials from communities across the province for the annual Union of BC Municipalities convention in Vancouver. Council met with Premier David Eby, Minister of Forests Bruce Ralston, Minister of Mental Health Addictions Jennifer Whiteside and Minister of Tourism, Arts Culture Lana Popham, to discuss the growing challenges we are facing in the municipality including housing, homelessness, climate change and infrastructure and the need for more support from the senior levels of government to tackle these issues. Paper Excellence informed me that more than 300 workers from the Crofton mill will be back on the job in the first week of October and the kraft pulp operations will restart in midOctober. After the threemonth shutdown, this is great news for the workers and their families, for our municipality and for the broader Cowichan region. However, curtailment of the paper operations has been extended to late October, affecting more than 100 workers. Paul Fletcher of the Somenos Marsh Wildlife Society presented on its Firehouse Creek and Samunu wetland proposal. The proposal outlined plans to restore Bings Creek upstream and downstream of the RCMP station on Canada Avenue and restore Firehouse Creek, which currently exists as a ditch located near the North Cowichan and Duncan fire halls between Duncan Street and Canada Avenue. These habitat restoration projects would not only benefit fish populations but would also help stormwater management and provide a place for public interaction with the aquatic environment. Two organizations which had applied for Permissive Tax Exemptions presented to council. Corina Finlay, on behalf of House of Grace Pregnancy Centre, and Scott Bayley, on behalf of Camp Qwanoes, each provided an overview of their organizations in response to councils decision at the Sept. 12 Committee of the Whole meeting to deny their requests for a permissive tax exemption. Council then gave first three readings to the Permissive Tax Exemption Bylaw which exempts certain properties in 2024 from municipal property taxes. The list of properties includes Camp Qwanoes, in addition to the other properties endorsed on Sept. 12. Council will be reviewing its Permissive Tax Exemption Policy over the next 12 months in advance of the 2025 budget. The Sewer Services User Fee Amendment Bylaw was adopted. This bylaw amendment ensures consistency with user fee practices and compliance with provincial legislation and is necessary now that North Cowichan issues separate bills for utility charges. An amendment to the Official Community Plan and zoning bylaws to facilitate a proposed fivelot subdivision at 6409 Wicks Rd. was denied. Council directed staff to align the Building Bylaw to reflect provincial Energy Step Code requirements for space and water heating in buildings. As of May 1, 2023, the Province requires all new residential and commercial buildings to demonstrate compliance with the BC Energy Step Code. North Cowichan will consider adopting Zero Emission Step Code EL3, once the Building Bylaw is amended in October, with EL4 effective July 1, 2024. This would mean that newly constructed buildings are energyefficient and use lowcarbon energy sources. North Cowichan will be engaging with the building industry on these changes. A Temporary Use Permit for 68236833 Bell McKinnon Rd. was approved. The permit will allow construction worker vehicle parking, trades trailers and storage of topsoil adjacent to the new hospital construction site. A Remedial Action Order to rectify hazardous conditions at 7900 Mays Rd. was imposed. A number of issues related to an exposed embankment have been noted. Council approved a request to apply for the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund Grant under the Volunteer Composite Fire Department Training Equipment funding stream for Wildland Personal Protective Equipment in the amount of 30,000. Prebudget approval for regional recreation budgets was approved. The 20242028 budget for the Cowichan Aquatic Centre and Fuller Lake Arena will be submitted to the Cowichan Valley Regional District. Council directed staff to investigate various aspects of installing solar power on civic buildings and homes and bring back a report to the Environmental Advisory Committee for review. Two items were heard at a public hearing An application to permit a detached accessory dwelling unit ADU at 6344 Woodgrove Way received third reading. A twolot subdivision at 3211 Malcolm Rd. received third reading and was adopted. The next council meeting will take place on Wednesday, Oct. 4 at 5 p.m.",1

According to the Associated Press, at least 600 people have been killed in Israel a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades and more than 300 have been killed in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes pound the territory. Dozens of civilians and soldiers from Israel were seized by Hamas fighters and taken back to Gaza. Many of the captives included women, children, and the elderly. Jeff Arbus, a Jewish man in Sault Ste. Marie who has served in numerous leadership roles within the local Beth Jacob Synagogue, calls the attack a blatant act of terrorism. This is a terrorist organization whose key aim is to get rid of Israel, he told SooToday. Thats stated clearly in their charter and in all their documents. What we saw yesterday was a complete act of terrorism theres no other way to describe it. Any attempt to justify the actions of this terrorist organization is in fact supporting terrorism. To me, its not complex. What happened yesterday is very clearcut. While Arbus and his wife dont have immediate family living in Israel, they work with people who do. Someone I work with provincially has a cousin who was murdered, he says. I know there are people in the Sault with connections to Israelis by family or by business or whatever it may be. Theres a huge concern because civilians are being targeted. Sault Ste. Marie has had a Jewish community for 140 years. For more than half that time, Congregation Beth Jacob has remained the first and only synagogue in the twin Saults. Earlier this year, Arbus led an antisemitism training course for some of the citys top officials, including Mayor Matthew Shoemaker, chief administrative officer Malcolm White, and Police Chief Hugh Stevenson. He has reached out to those same officials in the last day and a half to ensure the Saults Jewish community which is estimated to only be in the double digits remains protected in troubling times like this. The trend has been that when incidents like this occur, there is a global spike in antisemitic incidents, he says. We have been in touch with the mayors office and with the local police chief who have been very supportive. Were believing that there is no immediate threat to the local Jewish community, but were certainly being watchful. You lose sleep over stuff like that. While he didnt want to dive too deep into the complexities of the politics overseas, Arbus says he would be in favour of a twostate solution and believes most of the Jewish community would support that as well. If people want to support Palestinian liberation and a Palestinian state Ill join them, he says. But if they want to somehow excuse acts of terrorism as part of that struggle, they dont get my support at all. What happened yesterday is markedly different than what weve seen in the past, both in terms of its scope and the brutality of what happened. They killed civilians, posted videos parading over dead bodies, and desecrated those bodies. Regardless of how people may feel about Palestine or Palestinian liberation, yesterday was a blatant act of horrific terrorism. Politicians across the country, including Shoemaker, Premier Doug Ford, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, took to social media to condemn Hamas attacks. Arbus believes Canadas role in the conflict has some of its own complexities involved, but hes hopeful the country will help provide some muchneeded relief and advocacy for Israel. I think Canadas efforts at the United Nations could be stepped up towards a twostate solution, he admits. Hamas gets its arms from Iran, and Canada is in the middle of a deal with Iran regarding nuclear power. At some point, the rubber hits the road and youve got to make a decision. Theres work for Canada to do, but I think Canada has shown in the past their leadership in the Middle East. I hope they step up and that this all passes soon. We have to be hopeful, and we have to stand up to terrorism.",1

The Saturday quakes in the west of the country hit 35 km 20 miles northwest of the city of Herat, with one of 6.3 magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey USGS said. They were among the worlds deadliest quakes this year, after tremors in Turkey and Syria killed an estimated 50,000 in February. Janan Sayeeq, spokesman for the Ministry of Disasters, said in a message to Reuters that the toll had risen to 2,445 dead, but he revised down the number of injured to more than 2,000. Earlier, he had said that 9,240 people had been injured. Sayeeq also said 1,320 houses had been damaged or destroyed. The death toll spiked from 500 reported earlier on Sunday by the Red Crescent. Ten rescue teams were in the area, which borders Iran, Sayeeq told a press conference. More than 200 dead had been brought to various hospitals, said a Herat health department official who identified himself as Dr Danish, adding most of them were women and children. Bodies had been taken to several places military bases, hospitals, Danish said. Beds were set up outside the main hospital in Herat to receive a flood of victims, photos on social media showed. Food, drinking water, medicine, clothes and tents were urgently needed for rescue and relief, Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban political office in Qatar, said in a message to the media. The mediaeval minarets of Herat sustained some damage, photographs on social media showed, with cracks visible and tiles fallen off. Hemmed in by mountains, Afghanistan has a history of strong earthquakes, many in the rugged Hindu Kush region bordering Pakistan. Death tolls often rise when information comes in from more remote parts of a country where decades of war have left infrastructure in a shambles, and relief and rescue operations difficult to organise. Afghanistans healthcare system, reliant almost entirely on foreign aid, has faced crippling cuts in the two years since the Taliban took over and much international assistance, which had formed the backbone of the economy, was halted. Diplomats and aid officials say concerns over Taliban restrictions on women and competing global humanitarian crises are causing donors to pull back on financial support. The Islamist government has ordered most Afghan female aid staff not to work, although with exemptions in health and education. In August, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was likely to end its financial support for 25 Afghan hospitals because of funding constraints. It was not immediately clear if the Herat hospital was on that list. The quakes triggered panic in Herat, resident Naseema said. People left their houses, we all are on the streets, she wrote in a text message to Reuters on Saturday, adding that the city was feeling aftershocks. There are a total of 202 public health facilities in Herat province, one of which is the major regional hospital where 500 casualties had been taken, the World Health Organization WHOsaid in a report on Sunday. A vast majority of the facilities are smaller basic health centres and logistical challenges were hindering operations, particularly in remote areas, the WHO said. While search and rescue operations remain ongoing, casualties in these areas have not yet been fully identified, it said.

The game went through a delay in the first intermission when a jammed door prevented the ice resurfacing machines from getting out to flood the ice. A whole lot of ingenuity helped get the machines around to a different door and onto the ice to get the ice ready for the second period. The wait did nothing to dampen the London momentum. The Knights came out and played physically to begin the second period. Will Nicholl carried the puck into the Guelph end just past the sixminute mark of the second period on a 3on1 and slid a pass to Jacob Julien on the right side. Julien onetouched a pass to Jackson Edward and he buried his first of the year to give London a 20 advantage. Charlie Paquette scored for the Storm at 921 to cut Londons lead in half but Barkey set up Ruslan Gazizov for his first goal of 202324 and the Knights led 31 going into the final 20 minutes. Barkeys second of the game into an empty net sealed things for London with 49 seconds left in regulation time. The Knights outshot Guelph 3016. Michael Simpson earned his third victory of the season for London. Brayden Gillespie stopped 26 shots in net for the Storm. Linesperson Kevin Hastings honoured in his final OHL game. Jim Van Horne 980 CFPL Linesperson Kevin Hastings officiated his 1,038th game and his final game in the OHL. Hastings was honoured before the opening faceoff. Hastings will take on a new office role with the league. London wore jerseys for the game that will be auctioned off in support of Epilepsy Southwestern Ontario.

It was Cowans fourth preseason game in total. He had a goal and an assist in his first game against the Ottawa Senators and then an assist against the Buffalo Sabres in a game played in St. Thomas, Ont. Cowan also played in Montreal. NHL teams must declare their capcompliant rosters on Monday, Oct.9, so final decisions will be made between now and then. Piccinich loving the Norweigian air A season ago former Knight J.J. Piccinich headed to Norway to play for Stjernan. Piccinich had won a Memorial Cup with the Knights, a Kelly Cup with the Newfoundland Growlers and in his first season playing in the Eliteserien, Piccinich won a scoring title with 65 points in 45 games. In fact, he and his teammates Alex Dostie and Austin Cangelosi were 123 in league scoring. Through six games Piccinich is doing the same kind of offensive damage with 12 points to sit second in scoring in the Eliteserien. Dostie is no longer playing for Stjernan but Cangelosi is right there with Piccinich tied in points so far as the duo looks for a repeat atop the scoring race. Up next The London Knights and the Peterborough Petes will meet on Thursday, Oct. 12 in Peterborough for the first time since last years OHL Championship series.

The plan would involve integrating multidisciplinary goals for planning, infrastructure, climate action, flood management, and other challenges of the 21st Century, according to his presentation. There are a number of seriously concerning trends were seeing in our watershed today and the current forms of management or land use planning are simply not up to dealing with these trends. This comes largely from climate change and climate change is giving us a world which is quite different from the world we have experienced in the past, said Ross, who told council he had previously worked for the Ministry of the Environment and learned from experience the importance of dealing with negative environmental trends as they are discovered rather than being reactive. He said the Muskoka Watershed Council MWC has been actively promoting integrated watershed management as the most promising response to deal with the problems were facing. Were not alone in doing this. The Muskoka Watershed Advisory Group appointed by the Province of Ontario, largely as a result of the 2019 flood, recommended Integrated Watershed Management. Its referred to in the Provincial Policy Statement and many jurisdictions across Canada and the world are using Integrated Watershed Management IWM but not as yet in Muskoka. He told councillors its a project needed to preserve Muskokas ecosystem which is the basis for Muskokas economy. He said MWC, made up of volunteers, is in a unique position to partner with municipalities in getting an Integrated Watershed Management Plan in place. Once an IWMbased watershed management plan is in place, our role will likely diminish. We are a community of volunteers speaking to science, he said, adding that MWC would not be the administrator of the plan. Who would administer the plan would be determined as the plan is formalized. Deputy Mayor Dan Armour questioned whether it would be better to ask for funding from the District of Muskoka since it is a districtwide initiative. Ross said they want all municipalities to be involved and they need all municipalities to pitch in. A request for 15,000 was made. Councillor Scott Morrison suggested that the funds could come from the Towns portion of the Huntsville Municipal Accommodation Tax so the burden does not fall on the taxpayer, noting that he supports the initiative and that without the natural environment, there is no tourism. I could justify that money coming out of the MAT tax because it does affect tourism. If our lakes are full of bluegreen algae no one is going to come to visit. Staff told the committee to include it in the 2024 draft budget first and then see if it would qualify under the accommodation tax. Councillor Helena Renwick said she also supports the initiative, which she referred to as imperative. If we dont have clean lakes, were not going to get people here anymore, so I would highly support that. Armour said that while he does not disagree with the initiative, hed hate to be the only municipality to fund it. Huntsville Mayor Nancy Alcock said she understood the concern but said she did know that Lake of Bay and Bracebridge are incredibly supportive and District. Councillor Cory Clarke also questioned why MWC wouldnt go to the District first but said he agreed with the importance of the lakes and supports the project, although hed rather see the money come from the accommodation tax. I think we need to lead by example here, said Councillor Jason FitzGerald. Councillor Bob Stone said he agrees that the natural environment is the areas economy and needs to be protected. Im just thinking that theres no definite use for this money yet. Its just hey lets make a pot of money and then well decide how to disseminate it, so Im not all in. He also noted that the MAT money isnt just a giant pot of money. We want to use some of that for housing and many other great projects too so its not just an endless pot that we can keep taking from. Councillor Dione Schumacher said shed be in favour of supporting the project at 15,000 this year if it comes from the accommodation tax and at 10,000 initially suggested by the Mayor to get approval around the table if it comes from the property tax. I dont want to necessarily dip in too much, as Councillor Stone said we dont exactly know where its going but I do know it has touched our community and my little lake of Longs Lake in Utterson has bluegreen algae so it is there and that is one of our public beaches that we need to protect and I want to see the work done to be able to combat that. Alcock said, MWC is the only organization thats been doing research on algal blooms since we started seeing them in Muskoka. Renwick again said the project is very important, she suggested giving MWC 20,000 but said she would support 15,000. We should be leaders on this In the end, a majority of councillors voted in favour of setting aside 15,000 for the Muskoka Watershed Council as part of the 2024 budget discussions.

Real estate company City Developments Ltd. has built barriers and waterlevel sensors at the St. Regis Singapore hotel, Palais Renaissance shopping mall and Republic Plaza skyscraper. This system, along with sea walls, enables Singapore to do something extraordinary reclaim land thats below sea level. Still, Singapore has more intense rain, so its ponds, drainage canals and pumps are designed to cope with more water.","Bloomberg Markets During a halfcentury of independence, Singapore has fought to expand its territory, inch by hardwon inch. On the tip of the Malaysian peninsula, the island citystate piled up sand to expand its coastline and reclaim land from the sea. In that time, Singapore has grown by onequarter, adding landmass more than twice the size of Manhattan. At 284 square miles, Singapore is now approaching the size of all five boroughs of New York City. It plans to grow an additional 4 by 2030. Its a striking accomplishment, given that many other coasts are receding because of rising sea levels, a result of climate change. We are not planning to lose any inch of land permanently, says Ho Chai Teck, a deputy director at PUB, the government agency coordinating the effort to save the nations shores. Singapore will build a continuous line of defense along our entire coast. This is something that we take very seriously. Roughly onethird of Singapore is less than 16 feet above sea level, low enough for flooding to cause punishing financial losses. Some of its most prized property sits on vulnerable land the skyscrapers overlooking the Marina Bay waterfront, known for its luxury mall and casino, and the towers that house giant banks such as Singaporebased DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Southeast Asias largest, and UKbased Standard Chartered Plc. Assuming 1.5C of warming, prime real estate in the city worth S70 billion 50 billion faces a high risk of flooding, according to Bloomberg estimates using data from real estate company CBRE Group Inc. Another endangered, and vital, part of the country is Jurong Island, where Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. have oil and petrochemical operations. Youve got small island nations, but they dont have this much economic wealth, says Benjamin Horton, a professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who studies sealevel change. The actual value of every square meter in Singapore is off the charts. This is a country more susceptible to sealevel rise than virtually any country in the world. In 2019, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore would need to spend S100 billion over the next 100 years to protect against rising sea levels. The government has since put S5 billion toward a coastal and flood protection fund. Both the Singapore Armed Forces and climate change defenses are existential, he said then. These are lifeanddeath matters. Everything else must bend at the knee to safeguard the existence of our island nation. A days bike ride along Singapores coastal paths will take you past glittering skyscrapers and scenic dams, beaches and mangrove swampsdiverse scenes that make clear how the country must carefully tailor its approach. What Singapore does will be keenly watched by other populous coastal cities such as Bangkok, Miami, New York and Shanghai. Fortifying the City On a recent weekday, tourists and locals fly kites on a towering structure with dazzling views of Singapores skyline. But what theyre standing on is much more than an attraction. Its a S226 million dam called the Marina Barrage. Inside, seven giant pumps drain excess water into the sea during high tide and extreme rainfall. Currently, some kind of humanmade barrier protects 70 of Singapores coastline. But the citystate will have to reinforce and improve those shields as tropical storms increase and sea levels rise. The Hydroinformatics Institute and National University of Singapore are working with PUB to build a computer model simulating the combined effects of sealevel rise and rainfall on the countrys coastlines. When completed in 2025, it will help assess which areas are most vulnerable, based on the predicted depth and duration of floods. We have to look at this in a very dynamic way, Grace Fu, minister for sustainability and the environment, said at a September event launching a new coast and flood protection institute. Protecting us too much, you waste a lot of resources. If you build the coastal protection solution too low, then you will find that, several generations later, youll need to enhance it. Government authorities are already considering storm surge barriers on Singapores waterways. The barriers would generally be open, so ships can travel to their destinations. But during a big storm, they would close, encircling the citys industrial areas. Other possible measures raising the height of current coastal reservoir dikes tide gates, which block water and more embankments, typically raised piles of earth. Singapore is also building a huge additional terminal at its airport on higher ground, 18 feet above average sea level. More than 6 miles of drainage are planned to keep runways clear of water. Businesses are getting into the act, too. Real estate company City Developments Ltd. has built barriers and waterlevel sensors at the St. Regis Singapore hotel, Palais Renaissance shopping mall and Republic Plaza skyscraper. In the business district, Frasers Propertys 38story tower has added floodgates. More still needs to be done, says David Fogarty, CBREs head of ESG consulting services for Singapore and Southeast Asia. Companies are thinking about rising sea levels, but they arent acting fast enough. Enlisting Nature At the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, the roots of mangrove trees have all kinds of configurations. They can look like a pencil, a bent knee or a stilt. The tropical trees flourish in salty tidal waters. Their thick aboveground roots and trunks break waves and trap sedimentforming a natural barrier to rising seas. To protect shorelines properly, mangrove forests should sprawl for hundreds of yards. In neighboring Indonesia, they can even stretch for miles. In Singapore, mangroves can reduce storm wave heights by more than 75. Mangrove forests also soak up to four times as much carbon as rainforests. But mangroves alone arent enough. Singapore is studying whether it can combine the trees with other barriers, called revetments, often made of stone or concrete. Experiments involving combined mangroverock revetments are underway at Kranji Coastal Nature Park, near the wetland reserve, and Pulau Hantu, an island off the southern coast. Singapores existing sea walls and revetments limit one possible solution, encouraging the growth of more mangrove habitat, says Daisuke Taira, a mangrove researcher at the National University of Singapores Centre for Naturebased Climate Solutions. The country should preserve the current habitat of tropical trees, and their protective roots, researchers say. But it will likely have to rely more on barriers and other feats of engineering. When it comes to cultivating mangroves to keep the seas at bay, Taira says, Singapore is one of the most challenging places. Borrowing From the Dutch On Pulau Tekong, an island northeast of Singapore, giant machinery whirs and clanks as workers stabilize soil and lay out a network of intricately designed drains and pumps. The equipment collects and channels rainwater into a pond. Excess can then be pumped into the ocean. This system, along with sea walls, enables Singapore to do something extraordinary reclaim land thats below sea level. Singapore is taking a page from the Netherlands, a third of which is below sea level. The Dutch built sea walls beyond their coastline, creating new tracts of land they call polders. A beanshaped plot of land on Pulau Tekong is the first polder in Singapore. At 3 square miles, it will add 1 to Singapores landmass once its completed at the end of 2024 and will be used for military training. Polders use less sand than the kind of reclamation Singapore has used in the past. Thats a huge advantage because its one of the worlds biggest importers of sand, which is expensive. Singapore is adapting Dutch methods to the tropics. Its corner of the Pacific is calmer than the North Atlantic, so sea walls dont need to be as high as in the Netherlands, according to JanJaap Brinkman, a director at Dutch water research institute Deltares, which is advising Singapore. Still, Singapore has more intense rain, so its ponds, drainage canals and pumps are designed to cope with more water. Brinkman says the government is learning on its own and starting relatively small on Pulau Tekong Singapore wants to see if the technology is safe, and ensure everything is working well, before it takes the next step.

Social Welfare Ministry official Lay Shwe Zin Oo said Bago evacuees were sheltering in relief camps, schools and Buddhist monasteries, while the authorities were providing food, drinking water and other essential assistance. Reports in the staterun Myanmar Alinn newspaper on Monday said that trains that departed from Mandalay, the countrys secondlargest city in central Myanmar, and from southern Mawlamyine township were halted en route. Scheduled departures from Yangon, the biggest city in the country, were canceled after rail lines were flooded by the rapid flow of water from mountain torrents and the spillage from dams in the Bago region. MRTV said almost 1,000 people in Mon states Kyaikto township, just east of Bago, were sheltering in three relief camps, and there some evacuations as well in a northern part of Yangon. Myanmar experiences extreme weather virtually every year during the monsoon season. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people. In July and August this year, floods in Mon, Kayin and Rakhine states and the regions of Bago and Magway killed five people and displaced about 60,000.",1

Vancouver, Amon said, has implemented a rain city strategy that aims to integrate green infrastructure throughout planning decisions. He says green infrastructure can be expensive to install and need a bit more maintenance than a simple sewer pipe, which has made some municipalities more hesitant. Amon adds that green infrastructure can also contribute to more equitable neighbourhoods by adding foodbearing trees, culturally significant plants and more greenery to neighbourhoods that lack it. Green infrastructure is amazing, because it can be transformative in so many different ways, she said.","Idea is to divert stormwater into vegetated areas so less ends up in sewers From green roofs in Toronto to Vancouvers rain city strategy, Canadian cities are looking to become sponges in order to help mitigate some of the effects of extreme rainfall events. In Montreal, Mayor Valrie Plante announced last week that the city plans to develop some 30 additional sponge parks designed to catch and absorb rainwater and keep it from flowing into overburdened sewers during extreme rain events. Those, combined with an additional 400 sponge sidewalks, featuring added vegetation squares, will help the city retain the equivalent of three Olympic swimming pools in water at half the cost of underground works, the city said in a news release. Melanie Glorieux, a sustainable landscape planner with the firm Rousseau Lefebvre said that while the concept of building a sponge city isnt new, its an idea that more and more municipalities are embracing as they cope with extreme weather. The idea, she said, is to divert stormwater into low areas or channels planted with trees, shrubs and grasses, so that more of it is absorbed on the surface and less flows into sewers, lakes or rivers. As an added benefit, the plants filter the water before it enters the system, removing some of the pollutants it picks up from streets. Firstly, we reduce the quantity of water sent to sewers, and secondly, we improve the quality of what is there, she said The goal is to reverse some of the harm done by the last 40 to 50 years of caroriented urban development, which involved replacing natural spaces that soak up water with impermeable infrastructure such as roads and parking lots. In place of absorption, water was redirected to underground sewer systems, which can become overwhelmed by heavy rain, causing flooding and contamination of rivers. The sponge city concept, which first rose to prominence in China, is essentially the opposite limit runoff and maximize infiltration, Glorieux said. Green infrastructure can be incorporated into a landscape in many ways, from simple tree planting to rain gardens, swales, holding ponds and more complex bioretention systems that involve layers of filtering, she said. Some projects are also replacing asphalt with permeable paving that allows better water flow. Glorieux said most of the green infrastructure water retention areas are designed to absorb the first 25 millimetres of rainfall, which means they should be able to handle about 95 per cent of rain events. Emily Amon, the director of green infrastructure at Green Communities Canada, says the combination of increasingly severe weather events due to climate change and urbanization has led to real losses on the landscape in terms of our ability to absorb that stormwater we receive. On July 13, Montreal received a months worth of rain in less than two hours, causing some 85 millimetres of rain to flood underpasses, overflow from sewers and force city officials to warn citizens to stay away from waterways due to possible contamination. The nonprofit Green Communities Canada works with other organizations to help municipalities create green infrastructure, including planting mini forests and gardens that absorb rain and removing the pavement from old parking lots. Across Canada, cities appear to be jumping on board. Toronto has won praise for its bylaw requiring new developments greater than 2,000 square metres to have green roofs over part of their surfaces. The roofs soak up rainwater that otherwise would run off into sewers. Vancouver, Amon said, has implemented a rain city strategy that aims to integrate green infrastructure throughout planning decisions. She said the Federation of Canadian Municipalities has started a natural asset management program that encourages cities to categorize and put a dollar value on their green infrastructure so it can be better managed a strategy that was pioneered in Gibsons, B.C. Guillaume Grgoire, an assistant professor who studies plant sciences and green infrastructure at Universit Laval in Quebec City, says green infrastructure does not really have any downside, but it has to occupy a good part of the territory in order to have a true effect. He says green infrastructure can be expensive to install and need a bit more maintenance than a simple sewer pipe, which has made some municipalities more hesitant. However, he said comparative studies have shown that the cost over time is the same or less than that of upgrading sewer systems, even when the extra maintenance is taken into account. All three experts say that in addition to stormwater management, the sponge city model brings other benefits, including increased biodiversity, reduced heat island effect, attractive public spaces and more exposure to nature, which contributes to better mental health. Amon adds that green infrastructure can also contribute to more equitable neighbourhoods by adding foodbearing trees, culturally significant plants and more greenery to neighbourhoods that lack it. Green infrastructure is amazing, because it can be transformative in so many different ways, she said.",1

I was in Sudbury, Ontario and I was very much part of that closed adoption process.","Two city councillors talked tonight about their personal experiences with adoption Sault Ste. Marie city council voted tonight to investigate the possibility of establishing a secure dropoff location where babies may be anonymously surrendered. At the request of Ward 3 Coun. Angela Caputo and her Ward 2 counterpart Lisa VezeauAllen, council agreed to look into setting up a temperaturecontrolled Hopes Cradle bassinet box, most likely at a local fire station. Established by Calgarybased domestic abuse survivors charity Gems for Gems, Hopes Cradle offers mothers and caregivers a judgmentfree process for legally surrendering infants to childrens service professionals. The programs first two baby boxes were built into exterior walls in fire stations in Strathmore, Alberta, and Tach, Manitoba. Another is expected to open this fall in Clarington in Ontarios Durham region. Coun. Caputo talked at tonights city council meeting about her adopted infant daughter, Leo. Coun. VezeauAllen talked about being herself adopted. The vote was unanimous, except for Ward 5 Coun. Corey Gardi, who didnt attend the meeting. As many of you know, my daughter Leo entered into my life via adoption, Coun. Caputo said. So Im familiar with the adoption process. And while I am grateful for it, I want everyone to understand that it is not easy. It is not a simple process. And it is one that a lot of folks who might be suffering with mental health and addiction or have past traumas would really struggle to complete, Caputo said. So I have a little shout out to Leos birth mother. Without her I dont know where I would be. She searched for me. When she found me, she knew that she and that little unborn little girl had found the person that they were looking for. She fought to get through this adoption process. Not everyone would. Some dont have access to a phone for the many scheduled calls. Some would simply break, through the many mandated therapy sessions delving into their past traumas. And frankly, some would face violence or persecution, if anyone even found out they were pregnant. I will never pretend to understand the pain on a birth mothers heart when having to make a decision not to parent a child. Tonight, we have the option to potentially save lives for a very small cost. And given the crisis that we are facing as a community with mental health and addictions, I beg you to vote yes on this, Caputo said. I myself have an adoption story. I was adopted, said Coun. VezeauAllen. I was born in 1967. I was in Sudbury, Ontario and I was very much part of that closed adoption process. In my adoption papers it actually lied and said my dad was a law student. He was a bartender, VezeauAllen said. I also want to be very clear that Im very pro choice. I believe in a womans right to choose and this comes from a very lived experience a very heartfelt experience. Installing a Hopes Cradle baby box costs about 20,000. I think its really just about understanding how a woman might feel when shes faced with this decision and how she may not have cultural supports, financial support, the ability to make a decision Im extremely fortunate to have met my birth mother at the age of 34. I cannot even understand at the age of 21 how she felt and I later found out later in life, that my aunt her sister actually wanted to adopt me but they wouldnt allow that because she was a single woman, even though she was a nurse and quite willing to take care of me So change needs to happen. People need to be open about these things, VezeauAllen told the meeting. I hope all of my colleagues on council will support this. Its about keeping our community safe and giving people choice. It started for a reason. Ward 1 Coun. Sonny Spina said This is going to be an extremely important report coming back from staff. In the last couple of days, I had some important conversations with some folks who work in the child protection area in our community.... I want to just encourage staff... to have those conversations and include as many people as possible with Indigenous job services, local child services, appropriate government officials. Because from what Im told theres rapidly changing laws, procedures that are going on with adoptions right now. I think its important for us to have all of that picture looking forward and I really believe this is going to be a very important report. We have to get it right the first time. Im thankful that this has come forward and Im thankful that we have the opportunity to have this discussion. I just want to make sure we get it right and include as many people as possible to get that right, Spina said.",1

For JTTM subscription information, click here. On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched operation AlAqsa Flood also Known as AlAqsa Storm, a largescale surprise attack on Israel. As part of the attack, the Gazabased terrorist group fired thousands of rockets into Israel and dispatched fighters into Israeli towns and communities near the Gaza Strip.1 On October 8, 2023, the Telegram channel of the Hamas mouthpiece AlRisalah posted an article according to which senior members of the Iranled antiU.S. and antiIsrael axis of resistance, among them senior officials from Hamas, Iranbacked Iraqi militias, and the Houthi Ansar Allah movement in Yemen, warned the U.S. against intervening in the fighting to help Israel and threatened that any such intervention would lead to the involvement of all the forces of the axis of resistance in the campaign and endanger all the U.S. interests in the region. According to the AlRisalah website, senior officials of the axis of resistance informed it that the U.S. should beware the results of its blatant intervention in Israels favor in the fighting currently going on in the Gaza Strip, including equipping Israel with advanced weapons to perpetrate massacres against the residents of the Gaza Strip. The same officials told AlRisalah that American intervention will put U.S. interests in the area at great risk and the gates of hell will open to them its embassies in the region will be targets for attack and military surprises, and the AlAqsa Flood will drown its presence in the region. Hazem Qasem, a senior member of Hamas, said that if the U.S. brings its weapons and uses them in the region, it will become a full partner of Israels in its crimes against the Palestinian people. Nasr AlShammari, the deputy leader and spokesman of the Iraqi AlNujaba Movement militia, said that American intervention and the dispatch of naval vessels to the region would constitute a declaration of war on the entire region and a threat to all the peoples of the region. He asserted that such interference would transform the U.S. into a major player in the aggression, and would encounter a firm response which would endanger the American interests in Iraq and transform all its sites in the region into targets for attack. AlShammari asserted that the resistance will not abandon its role in the attack on the American interests in all of Iraq, and will make the U.S. regret its position. He added that, the Palestinian people will not remain alone in this war, and the resistance in every place is ready to transform the campaign into a flood that will drown its the American interests. Major General Abdallah AlJafari, spokesman for the aerial defense forces of the Houthi Ansar Allah movement in Yemen, declared that the campaign being led by the Palestinian resistance is the start of a comprehensive campaign that all the forces of the axis of resistance will join. He also said that Washington wants to protect its forward operating base in the region, in the form of the Israeli entity, but it will realize that all its bases are in range of attack. He further claimed that Yemen has accurate missiles called Toophan missiles which have a 2,000 km range, and can hit Tel Aviv and beyond, as far as Dimona in the south. He also contended that Yemen has drones with a range of more than 2,500 km, which can carry various warheads, including cluster bombs. According to AlJafari, the Toophan missiles have a speed greater than Mach 50, carry warheads of various sizes, and can attack the Israeli nuclear facilities. He also contended that among the axis forces there is a clear agreement according to which if one arena is in need of assistance, the others will come to its aid, and the American presence portends the intervention of the other arenas in the campaign.2 It is notable that since Hamas launched the surprise attack against Israel, the Iranbacked militias in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen have vowed to support Hamas and the Palestinian factions which have joined the fighting, and have explicitly threatened to attack American targets in the region in the event of American intervention in the fighting in Israels favor.3",1

But it has received a broadside of criticism, including from a top European Union official, questioning the adequacy of the response. Outside watchdog groups said misinformation about the war abounds on the platform, whose workforce including its content moderation team was gutted by billionaire Elon Musk after he bought it last year. Fake and manipulated imagery circulating on X include repurposed old images of unrelated armed conflicts or military footage that actually originated from video games, said a Tuesday letter to Musk from European Commissioner Thierry Breton. This appears to be manifestly false or misleading information. Breton, the EUs digital rights chief, also warned Musk that authorities have been flagging potentially illegal content that could violate EU laws and you must be timely, diligent and objective in removing it when warranted. San Franciscobased X didnt immediately respond to a request for comment about Bretons letter. A post late Monday from Xs safety team claimed it is treating the crisis with utmost effort In the past couple of days, weve seen an increase in daily active users on X in the conflict area, plus there have been more than 50 million posts globally focusing on the weekends terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas. As the events continue to unfold rapidly, a crosscompany leadership group has assessed this moment as a crisis requiring the highest level of response. That includes continuing a policy frequently championed by Musk of letting users help rate what might be misinformation, which causes those posts to include a note of context but not disappear from the platform. The struggle to identify reliable sources for news about the war was exacerbated over the weekend by Musk, who on Sunday posted the names of two accounts he said were good for following the war in realtime. Analyst Emerson Brooking of the Atlantic Council called one of those accounts absolutely poisonous. Journalists and X users also pointed out that both accounts had previously shared a fake AIgenerated image of an explosion at the Pentagon, and that one of them had posted numerous antisemitic comments in recent months. Musk later deleted his post. Brooking posted on X that Musk had enabled fake war reporting by abandoning the blue check verification system for trusted accounts and allowing anyone to buy a blue check. Brooking said Tuesday that it is significantly harder to determine ground truth in this conflict as compared to Russias invasion of Ukraine last year and Elon Musk bears personal responsibility for this. He said Musks changes to the X platform have made it impossible to quickly assess the credibility of accounts while his introduction of view monetization has created perverse incentives for warfocused accounts to post as many times as possible, even unverified rumors, and to make the most salacious claims possible. War is always a cauldron of tragedy and disinformation Musk has made it worse, he added. Further, Brooking said via email Musk has repeatedly and purposefully denigrated the idea of an objective media, and he made platform design decisions that undermine such reporting. We now see the result. Part of Musks drastic changes over the past year included removing many of the people responsible for moderating toxic content and harmful misinformation. One former member of Twitters public policy team said the company is having a harder time taking action on posts that violate its policies because there arent enough people to do that work. The layoffs are undermining the capacity of Twitters trust and safety team, and associated teams like public policy, to provide needed support during a critical time of crisis, said Theodora Skeadas, one of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in the months after Musk bought the company. X says it changed one policy over the weekend to enable people to more easily choose whether or not to see sensitive media without the company actually taking down those posts. X believes that, while difficult, its in the publics interest to understand whats happening in real time, its statement said. The company said it is also removing newly created Hamasaffiliated accounts and working with other tech companies to try to prevent terrorist content from being distributed online. It said it is also continuing to proactively monitor for antisemitic speech as part of all our efforts. Plus weve taken action to remove several hundred accounts attempting to manipulate trending topics. Linda Yaccarino, whom Elon Musk named in May as the top executive at X, withdrew from an upcoming threeday tech conference where she was scheduled to speak, citing the need to focus on how the platform was handling the war. With the global crisis unfolding, Linda and her team must remain fully focused on X platform safety, X told the organizers of the WSJ Tech Live conference being held next week in Laguna Beach, California.

Speaking on The Mike Farwell Show on Tuesday, Fishburn said the inhumanity of some of the sights can be heartbreaking but also confusing and difficult to unpack. Its a very complicated political and religious landscape in the Middle East, Fishburn said. And sometimes it leads people to stay silent as well because they dont want to offend either side. Fishburn though noted whats most important is for people to know its okay to feel whatever they may be feeling and its also okay to let those feelings show.

She also suggested limiting our time on social media and watching the news. When you have those gruesome images just on repeatthat triggers trauma. Theres no question, she said.

Today, I was pleased to announce that the cityofhamilton will receive over 93M in incentive payments through the Housing Accelerator Fund to deliver significant, lasting changes to the way homes are built in Hamilton and deliver over 2,600 additional housing permits. pic.twitter.com9Q9uLWgrNZ Filomena Tassi FilomenaTassi October 10, 2023 However, the minister says the programs stemming from the investment, such as the governments 4 billion Housing Accelerator Fund, will take time. WATCH MORE Filomena Tassi makes a federal housing announcement in Hamilton at 9 a.m. This isnt the first housing crisis to hit cities like Hamilton. The Second World War saw a housing crisis hitting across the country as there was a growing shortage for those working in the war industry, followed by a flood of returning soldiers in need of somewhere to live. Nearly 80 years ago the federal governments Wartime Housing Corporation launched a homebuilding program. Built in the 1940s, 50s, and early 60s, they were known as Victory or Strawberry Box houses because of their resemblance to fruit crates. These homes are still standing across Canada, with some of the streets of areas like Hamiltons east mountain lined with the wartime bungalows and oneandahalf storey houses adorned with what have become iconic steep roofs. WATCH MORE Housing minister says Hamilton still in control of developing on expanded urban boundary The builds provided the modest and affordable homes that were needed at the time. Today HamOnt became the 3rd city in CA to receive from the Federal Housing Accelerator Fund.

It was definitely risky, said Sini RinneKanto, another cocurator of the exhibition, because for much of World War II, Finland was aligned with the German Reich.","NEW YORK, NY . Europe was on the brink of World War II when Tove Jansson, a Scandinavian writer and artist, sat down to sketch her first Moomin story, about a snoutnosed troll living in a magical land threatened by a rising flood. The halfwritten draft was forgotten until after the war, when it was published in 1945 as The Little Trolls and the Great Flood, the first in a series of nine Moomin books, which became classics of Finnish literature. The Moomin characters adorable Little My, cheeky Snork Maiden and moody Snufkin gained international fame in 1954, when Jansson made them the protagonists of a comic strip for The Evening News, a newspaper in London. In the 1990s, the Moomins enjoyed a second wave of popularity when a Japanese and Dutch collaboration created an animated Moomin television program and a Moomin feature film. Today, the Moomins are probably Finlands most beloved cultural export, and Janssons books, written in Swedish, have been translated into more than 50 languages. But the woman behind the series, a FinnishSwedish lesbian artist and ardent pacifist, who lived with her partner for half the year on an island, is far less well known. A new exhibition, Houses of Tove Jansson, which opened in Paris at Espace MontLouis on Sept. 29, aims to bring more attention to her entire oeuvre, and how it was shaped by her utopian vision. In addition to Moomin illustrations and cartoons, the show includes Janssons paintings and sketches, as well as designs for costumes and sets much of it whimsical expressions of a wish for peace, tolerance and harmony. The show also shares biographical information about her youth, her familial relationships including with her life partner, Tuulikki Pietil and the places where she created her art. We felt that there is so much more to be said about her work, said Tuukka Laurila, a member of the Parisian art collective The Community, which curated the exhibit in collaboration with the artists estate to bring a new perspective to her work and to explore her work in todays context, he added. By understanding the biographical elements of Janssons life, Laurila said, you realize that many of the characters in the Moomin books were inspired by the people around her, and by her life. Once you know which character represents who, it gives you a reading of Toves life. Thingumy and Bob, two inseparable little creatures in dresses who speak a secret language, represent Tove and her first love, Vivica Bandler, for example. The optimistic, problemsolving TooTicky was directly inspired by Pietil, Laurila said. Such samesex relationships were criminalized in Finland until the 1970s, but they had a place in the Moomins world. In the books, there is also a focus on living in nature, developing friendships with unusual creatures, learning from challenges and finding ways to help one another. Boel Westin, a professor of childrens literature at Stockholm University who wrote a biography of Jansson, said the artist used her work to express her ideas around pacifism. During the war, she wrote in her diary that she wanted to construct a happy society and another world, Westin said. Perhaps you can see the Moomin world as a some kind of realization, or fictionalization, of that dream. Also on Artdaily Claude Cormier, landscape architect with a playful eye, dies at 63 Jansson, who died in 2001, was born in Helsinki in 1914. Her Swedish mother, illustrator Signe HammarstenJansson, and her FinnishSwedish father, sculptor Viktor Jansson, met in Paris while they were studying art. Tove started drawing as soon as she could hold a pen and went on to study art in Stockholm and Paris. At 15, she created her first illustration for Garm, a Swedishlanguage political satire magazine that openly criticized the rising fascist and communist movements of the time. She worked with the magazine until 1953, producing about 100 cover illustrations, including caricatures of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin. It was definitely risky, said Sini RinneKanto, another cocurator of the exhibition, because for much of World War II, Finland was aligned with the German Reich. Some of Janssons Garm illustrations were censored, RinneKanto added. From 1944, Jansson lived half the year in an atelier in Helsinki, and once spring came, she would spend the rest of the year with Pietil, living on a tiny island, called Klovharun, on the Finnish archipelago. The island had only one house theirs which had no electricity or running water they brought all their supplies by boat. The little house on their island was just one room, said Sophia Jansson, Toves niece, who grew up visiting the island. They also had a tent next to the house, and they slept in that most often, because they loved the idea of hearing the wind and the sea. There was another reason for living on an island In Finland, the couple could have faced arrest or legal penalties for being in a samesex relationship, but on Klovharun, they could live together openly. They spent time there for 30 years, until they grew old and Jansson became afraid of the sea. But they were not completely isolated, Sophia said. The couple regularly welcomed family and friends, in much the same way Janssons Moomin characters extend hospitality to both blood relatives and strangers. When guests would visit, the guests would sleep in the house, and Tove and Tuulikki would sleep in the tent, Sophia said. In the Moomin world, the door is always open. This idea of creating a safe home was central to Janssons writing, Westin said. In the books, home is a place where you can be secure, where you can have fun, she said, but at the same time, home is sometimes threatened by catastrophe, so you have to fight to keep it. The situations of the Moomin characters reflected Janssons reality, her niece said. That was true from the first book, in which Moomintroll and his mother go in search of Moominpapa, who is lost. Without at all exaggerating, everybody that she knew had lost somebody, Sophia said. Lots of men died at the front, so there were lots of fathers missing everyone was on the move, and the refugee theme was very prevalent. RinneKanto said many of the themes of Janssons work especially natural disaster, climate catastrophe and the plight of refugees continued to resonate with contemporary readers. Shes describing what were currently going through, RinneKanto said, but its amazing to think that she was writing these 80 years ago.

One of the main organizers for many of the actions in the UK, U.S. and Canada is the Palestinian Youth Movement. Accordingly, there was a high level of participation from the new generation of Palestinian and other youth, all of whom are taking their place in the historic movement for the liberation of Palestine. In Canada on October 7, 8 and 9, actions in the form of rallies, marches and banner drops were held in Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton, Vancouver, Toronto, London and Calgary. From October 7 to 9, at least 57 actions were held across North America and Europe alone, with more to come in the following days. The occupying forces are once again resorting to collective punishment and further crimes against the people of Gaza by waging a massive and indiscriminate bombing campaign and attempting to completely cut off Gaza, to block the entry of food, fuel and supplies to the population of 2.3 million, which can only lead to humanitarian crisis. While the border wall of Gaza was breached in multiple places and at least one border crossing was destroyed by the resistance at the start of the operation, Israel now claims that it has once again locked down Gaza. Mustafa Barghouti, General Secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, in a recent interview on CNN on the situation in Palestine, decries the attempts by the Zionists and their collaborators to criminalize the Palestinian resistance and all those who support the Palestinian cause. An excerpt from the video can be viewed here. Freedom for Palestine The narrative of unfolding events presented by the Canadian government, the cartel parties in the Parliament, the CBC and monopoly media is all based on disinformation and depriving the polity of context and the history of Palestine, to then try to justify Zionist crimes in the name of selfdefence and equate Palestinians just resistance and national liberation to terrorism. According to this dehumanizing outlook, the Palestinian people were never dispossessed of their historic homeland by the Zionists and their collaborators. Thus, their right to resist and all other rights that belong to them as a people, especially as a people living under occupation, and the historical crimes committed against them on which Israel was founded, do not exist. Such disinformation is preparing the ground for even further crimes by the Zionists. The actions across Canada and around the world in support of the Palestinian resistance make clear that this will not pass. The Israeli zionists are blinded by the imperialist outlook that might makes right and that the use of force is the deciding factor. They receive billions of dollars from the U.S. imperialists to arm themselves to the teeth and carry out innumerable crimes against the Palestinians, as well as support from Britain and big powers of Old Europe. They think that they can use force to carry out relentless expansion of illegal settlements, the collective punishment of mass incarceration and trampling the rights of the Palestinians. They refuse to negotiate and to respect their obligations under international law, and do all of this for decades with impunity. To call the Palestinian people and their resistance terrorists while theirs is a terror regime demands a reckoning which is long overdue. Support for the resistance to affirm the rights of the Palestinian people and to hold the Zionist occupiers to account is reflected in the militant and unequivocal support for the resistance and refusal of conciliate with Zionism seen in demonstrations around the world. What these actions across Canada and around the world make clear is that it is the role of the people and their organized resistance and defence of their rights which is decisive. The Communist Party of Canada MarxistLeninist reiterates its categorical condemnation of the state of Israel for its ongoing attempt to commit genocide to wipe out the Palestinian people and seize their entire territory. It condemns the government of Canada and those MPs and opposition parties who declare that the resistance fighters are terrorists while Israel is engaged in justified selfdefence and that anyone who supports the right to be of the Palestinian people is antisemitic, engaged in a hate crime and is to be prosecuted as an extremist or terrorist. It condemns the stand taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who convened the socalled Incident Response Group of ministers and senior officials and condemned the armed resistance of Palestinian fighters as terrorist attacks against Israel. He expressed Canadas full support for Israels socalled right to defend itself, which is not a right of occupiers recognized in any international law, but remained silent on the rights of the people of Palestine. On October 9, Trudeau went on to say at an Ottawa rally in support of Israel, Canada unequivocally and in the strongest possible terms condemns these terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas. We stand with Israel and reaffirm our support for Israels right to defend itself in accordance with international law. He then added, Let me be very clear Hamas terrorists are not a resistance. They arent freedom fighters, they are terrorists. And no one in Canada should be supporting them, much less celebrating them. Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre stated, Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian people, it does not speak for Muslims, and it surely does not speak for Canadians. He clearly did not see the irony in suggesting that he, on the other hand, presumably does speak for Canadians even with so many saying Canadas stand is not in our name. Poilievre went further saying, And that is why I unreservedly condemn any and all who took part in the disgusting celebrations that we have seen on our streets. Many politicians and officials at the provincial and municipal levels are also attempting to portray the resistance as terrorism and support for the resistance as support for terrorism. Canadians and Quebeckers should consider carefully what it means that after being caught redhanded giving ovations to a Nazi collaborator in the House of Commons, and then claiming that this is a mistake, Canadas socalled political leaders are now unreservedly backing Zionist crimes and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. All Out to Support the Palestinian Resistance End the Occupation Now Freedom and Justice for Palestine Palestine resistance fighters tear down fence between Gaza and occupied Palestine, October 7, 2023 At dawn on October 7, Palestinian resistance fighters launched a stunning assault from occupied Palestine to smash the siege on Gaza with a comprehensive offensive confronting the occupier by land and air, taking control of Palestinian land, seizing occupation settlers and soldiers and launching thousands of missiles. The Palestinian resistance forces are fighting to advance towards the liberation of Palestine, Samidoun, the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network wrote. They reported that Brigadier General Nimrod Aloni is one of the dozens of hostages they were able to take. The hostages are from among the occupation soldiers and settlers taken in order to liberate the 5,250 Palestinian prisoners in occupation prisons, including the 1,350 jailed without charge or trial under administrative detention, 39 women and 170 children. The operation, called AlAqsa Flood, was launched on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war in which Egypt reclaimed the occupied Sinai from Zionist occupation, and is set to alter the direction of the struggle in occupied Palestine, moving from resistance toward revolution and liberation, the organization wrote. It explained that the resistance operation comes in response to the ongoing stream of crimes against the Palestinian people, the daily murder of Palestinians on the streets of the West Bank of occupied Palestine, the siege on Gaza, the theft of land for settlements, the denial of refugees right to return, imposing exile for over 75 years, the torture and attacks on the Palestinian prisoners, the ongoing invasions of AlAqsa Mosque, and the 75 years of Zionist occupation and over 100 years of imperialist domination and colonialism throughout occupied Palestine. It also comes to bring about the liberation of Palestinian prisoners, as part and parcel of the Palestinian people and land. Samidoun continues It is a decisive rebuke to the entire path of Oslo and normalization imposed upon the Palestinian and Arab people for the past 50 years, indicating a new path forward with a clear goal liberation, and nothing less. It builds upon the liberation of south Lebanon from occupation by the Lebanese resistance, led by Hezbollah, in 2000, and the defeat of the Zionist invasion of Lebanon in 2006, as well as the successive heroic battles waged by the Palestinian resistance throughout occupied Palestine and especially from its base area of resistance land in Gaza. Samidoun has joined the Masar Badil, the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement in calling the masses of our Palestinian people, supporters of the resistance in exile and diaspora, allies from the liberation forces and movements, and solidarity committees with the Palestinian people everywhere, to express their support for the heroic Palestinian resistance, raise the flag of Palestine and the banners of resistance. The Masar Badil has called on its organizations and supporters to organize popular, political and media demonstrations and events to expose the Zionist crimes against our people in occupied Palestine, and to support the AlAqsa Flood operation announced by the CommanderinChief of the Izz alDin alQassam Brigades the military wing of Hamas, Brother Mohammed alDeif. The statement says The heroic Palestinian resistance has opened a chapter of battles of dignity and pride at the dawn of October 7, 2023, and it is now responding to decades of continuous and repeated Zionist, U.S. and European aggression against the masses of our Arab and Islamic nation. For its part, Hamas stated this operation, called AlAqsa Flood was launched on October 7 with more than 7,000 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance movement also said its fighters have joined the operation as Hamas called on Palestinians everywhere to fight and on resistance groups in Lebanon to join the fighting against Israel. Israel responded with massive air strikes deep inside Gaza, killing scores and wounding hundreds of people and vowing unprecedented retaliation.Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. We are in a war and we will win it. He told everyone in Gaza to evacuate or face the consequences of Israeli strikes, despite the fact that Gaza is an area of about 365 square km, and home to 2.3 million Palestinians, which has been under an Israeli occupation and blockade since 2007, meaning that the people have no where to go. Palestinians inspect the ruins of mosques and homes following Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City, October 9, 2023. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed and at least 123,500 have been displaced by Israeli bombings as of October 9. Crowds gather on October 9, 2023, for the funeral of 15yearold Imad Jareh Adili, shot the night before by Israeli colonial forces at the entrance of Beita, south of Nablus. These forces have killed at least 11 Palestinians in the West Bank at demonstrations in support of resistance in Gaza and in confrontations with the army. Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on October 7 I have signed an order instructing Israel Electric Company to stop the electricity supply to Gaza. Power outages have long been an everyday occurrence in Gaza and households only had electricity for several hours a day on a rotational basis on the days before recent power cuts started. Gazas power authority informed that 80 per cent of the electricity supplies to Gaza from the national grid were cut off following Israels announcement. As of October 9, the UN informs that the Gaza Power Plant is now the only source of power and could run out of fuel within days. The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel, UN Human Rights Commission in its recent report September 2023 concluded that Israel has violated and continues to violate the right of the Palestinian people to selfdetermination by its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. The legal consequence of the violation of right to selfdetermination, which is an obligation erga omnes toward all, is the responsibility of the State of Israel. The current occupation, which has lasted 56 years to date, is unlawful under international law. The result of the unlawful acts entails legal consequences for Israel to bring an end to the internationally wrongful act. All States and the UN are also under an obligation to act urgently to bring the unlawful acts to an end. Palestinian children fill water bottles after Israeli colonial forces announce a complete siege cutting off food, water, fuel and electricity, October 9, 2023. As of October 9, the death toll of Palestinians has risen to 687 people, including 140 children and over 2,900 injured. At least 900 Israelis have been killed and over 2,616 wounded. The United Nations says 123,538 Palestinians have been displaced by fighting. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees estimates that 73,538 people are sheltering across 64 schools in Gaza, some of which are designated emergency shelters. Meanwhile, 130 Israelis are reportedly being held captive and approximately 750 Israelis are currently missing, according to Israeli media. The U.S. said that nine U.S. citizens have died during ongoing hostilities in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israel has now initiated Operation Swords of Iron which it says is directed against Hamas but in fact targets the entire population of Gaza. Israel has amassed a force 300,000 strong and an all out Israeli ground attack on the Gaza Strip is expected. Israels Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a complete siege of the Gaza Strip on October 9. I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed, Gallant said. On the morning of October 10, the Israeli military said its air force had dropped 2,000 munitions and more than 1,000 tonnes of bombs on Gaza in the last 20 hours. It has shelled 20 highrise residential buildings, mosques, hospitals, banks and other civilian infrastructure, news agencies report. Despite the large number of civilian buildings struck, the Israeli military claims it has destroyed 800 military targets in Gaza as part of its bombing campaign. Gallant said, We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly. Salama Marouf, head of media for the Hamas government of Gaza, said Gallants statement was cover to justify the occupations aggression against civilian people and property. UN observers concur. Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza have targeted houses and apartment buildings, with some struck without warning for residents to evacuate, the UN said on October 9. One Israeli airstrike in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, for example, killed 19 members of the same family. Conducting airstrikes against civilian targets without warning has become Israels new normal. The execution of Israeli hostages will be the response to the Israeli forces attacks on residential buildings and civilian facilities, Hamas said in a statement. Intense clashes are also reported as the resistance fighters engage Israeli troops in several cities across the occupied West Bank, including clashes in Jenin, Nablus, Jericho, and Hebron. Palestinian media reports more than 300 acts of resistance in the West Bank since Hamas began its operation, including several shootings targeting Israeli troops. The Jalameh checkpoint was set ablaze by Palestinian fighters on October 8. Confrontations with Israeli forces were reported in the town of alIssawiya, northeast of occupied Jerusalem and in Wadi alJooz, Ras alAmoud, and alThawri neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. International Response U.S. President Joe Biden has ordered the largest U.S. aircraft carrier and warplanes to move closer to Israel in a show of support for Israels war against the Palestinian people. The U.S. also promised to provide munitions and equipment to Israel, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on October 9. Israel has also requested the Biden administration provide it additional Iron Dome missile interceptors, small diameter bombs, and machine gun ammunition. For his part, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that Britain unequivocally stands with Israel and has offered potential military aid. He also posted a picture of Downing Street to social media, with the Israeli flag projected on it with the caption We Stand with Israel. Another was projected on Londons City Hall. Lebanons Hezbollah resistance movement says it has fired shells and guided missiles toward Israelioccupied Lebanese territories, in response to Israeli bombardment of its installations. Hezbollah said it had targeted the Radar, Zabdin, and Ruwaysat AlAlam sites in the Israelioccupied Shebaa Farms. The attacks were carried out on the path to liberate what remains occupied of our Lebanese land and in solidarity with the victorious Palestinian resistance, the struggling and patient Palestinian people, Hezbollah said. Qatar is holding negotiations between Palestinian organizations and Israel for a possible deal on a prisoner swap. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation OIC has condemned Israels ongoing military aggression against the people in Palestine, stressing that the main cause of the latest bloody conflict is the regimes disregard for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. The OIC said the continuation of the Israeli occupation and its failure to adhere to the resolutions of international legitimacy, and the escalation of the pace of its attacks and daily crimes against the Palestinian people, their land and holy sites, and depriving them of their legitimate rights is the main reason for instability. Irans mission to the United Nations says Operation AlAqsa Storm is a legitimate defence against decades of Israeli occupation. It rejected allegations that Tehran had a role in Hamas largescale military operation. It has been taken solely by Palestine itself, the mission said. The resolute measures taken by Palestine constitute a wholly legitimate defence against seven decades of oppressive occupation and heinous crimes committed by the illegitimate Zionist regime, the mission said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba issued a statement on October 8 which said The Republic of Cuba expresses grave concern over the escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine, which is the result of 75 years of continuous violation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and Israels aggressive and expansionist policy. Cuba demands a broad, fair and lasting solution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, on the basis of the creation of two states, which enables the Palestinian people to exercise their right to free determination and to possess an independent and sovereign state within the borders prior to 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The United Nations Security Council must fulfill its mandate and put an end to the impunity of Israel, the occupying power, of which the United States has historically been accomplice, by repeatedly obstructing the bodys action, undermining peace, security and stability in the Middle East. Cuba calls for peace and the search for a solution through negotiation that avoids a further escalation of conflict that has already cost the lives of tens of thousands of people. Indonesia and Pakistan also expressed support for the Palestinians. They called on Israel to immediately halt its brutal aggression against Palestinians. Indonesia is deeply concerned with the escalation of conflict between Palestine and Israel. Indonesia urges the immediate end of violence to avoid further human casualties, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The root of conflict, namely the occupation of the Palestinian territories by Israel, must be resolved, in accordance with the parameters agreed upon by the UN, the statement said. This came after the Indonesia Hospital, located in the northern Gaza Strip city of Beit Lahia, was hit by Israeli forces on Saturday killing one of the facilitys local staff. Indonesian nongovernmental organization Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, or MERC, which funded the hospital, has vociferously condemned the attack. The direct attack on the Indonesia Hospital complex in Beit Lahia, Gaza Strip on Saturday appears to amplify how in the IsraelPalestine war, international humanitarian law is never under consideration for Israel, the committee said in a statement. Pakistans President Dr. Arif Alvi criticized Israel for suppressing the rights of Palestinians, urging the international community to play its active role to ease the tension between Israel and Palestine. Progress toward peace cannot materialize without condemnation of usurpation and brutalization of Palestinian rights and people by Israel, Alvi wrote A viable and sovereign State of Palestine must be established on the basis of pre1967 borders and UN resolutions. The international community needs to intervene to bring an end to the conflict, protect civilians, and work towards a lasting peace in the Middle East, he added. Riyad H. Mansour the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations urged the international community not to let Israel double down on its terrible choices, but to instead encourage it to change course and remind it that there is a path to peace, where neither Palestinians nor Israelis are killed. And it is the one diametrically opposed to the one Israel has embarked on. History for some media and politicians starts when Israelis are killed, he said, adding that Our people have endured one deadly year after another. ... Where is the international protection the Palestinian people are entitled to when the occupying power violates international law and harms those it is obliged to protect Arent Palestinian lives worth saving The Palestinian civilians killed, the Palestinian children killed in occupied Palestine, could have been spared. Isnt that a moral and legal obligation and a contribution to peace Why nothing is done when those killed are Palestinians We need to think hard of what logic we want to see prevail here. If this is about vengeance, then many Palestinians will feel they have much to avenge. If this is about peace, then the way to it is not through further entrenching oppression and occupation but by ending it. You cannot say nothing justifies killing Israelis and then provide justifications for killing Palestinians. We are not subhumans. We will never accept a rhetoric that denigrates our humanity and reneges our rights, a rhetoric that ignores the occupation of our land and oppression of our people. Mansour urged the international community to consider a different path, one that prioritizes the lives and rights of the Palestinian people. He called for equal measures of freedom and security, emphasizing that standing up against occupation is not just the right thing to do morally, but also legally and politically. Last October, we stated before the Security Council The Palestinian people will be free, one day or the other, one way or another. We chose the peaceful way, the one the international community advocates for. Do not let Israel prove us wrong, for our sake and theirs, said Mansour. When Israel now tries to justify yet another assault by the same faulty premise, no one should say or do anything to encourage it down this path. We know only too well that the messages about Israels right to defend itself will be interpreted by Israel as license to kill, to pursue on the very path that led us here. The UN Security Council met on October 8 to discuss the developments but was unable to issue a statement as no agreement could be reached. Statements As Israeli colonial violence escalates in Gaza, Labour for PalestineCanada demands that the Canadian government call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the Israeli occupation and apartheid in Palestine. We offer our condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in recent days, and throughout the decades of forcible dispossession and occupation, no matter where they live. It is a heartbreaking truth that the daily violence and terror experienced by the Palestinians, at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces and with the support of the international community, requires relentless and sustained resistance. A population cannot live under siege and apartheid with the daily threat of harassment, humiliation, violence, home demolitions and murder without responding. The UN claims 2023 has already been the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started counting deaths in 2006. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of this year, according to the health ministry. Western world leaders, including Canada, have shamefully turned a blind eye as far right Israeli ministers publicly provoke violence, as land grabbing became official government policy, and unspeakable war crimes are a regular occurrence. After more than 16 years of living under economic and military siege by Israel, of being confined to the worlds largest open airprison, Gaza has finally broken free and Palestinians are demonstrating their determination to liberate themselves and their land from 75 years of settlercolonization, apartheid and occupation. The current Palestinian violence must be understood within the context that it is taking place in order for genuine peace and justice to be realized. Now, after such prolonged and shameful silence, Canada and its political parties have jumped to condemn Palestinians for resisting their own annihilation. Yet they refuse to even mention that Israel, a military superpower, has now declared war on Palestinians for daring to resist. As members of the labour movement in Canada, we call for an end to the Israeli occupation and apartheid in Palestine. We further call on the Canadian Government to recognize and condemn the incessant violence perpetrated and provoked by Israel. We commend Palestinians for their heroic resistance and their indomitable will. We recognize the right of all people to resist their own occupation, including through armed struggle. This right, first protected by the Geneva Conventions in 1949, has been reaffirmed numerous times by the United Nations general assembly. We refuse to be divided or to fall into the colonial trap of condemning certain Palestinian groups or certain forms of resistance. Canadians should not attempt to dictate how an oppressed indigenous population fights for their own liberation. We call on all trade unions and labour leaders to be in solidarity with Palestinian resistance by educating their members, pressuring politicians, and championing boycott, divestment, and sanctions against apartheid Israel. The labour movement must use its power and influence to end Canadas support for Israels racist colonial regime. We encourage trade unionists to contact Labour for Palestine for resources and support towards that end. The Association of Palestinian Arab Canadians APAC is deeply concerned with the ongoing violence in Palestine and Israel and stands in solidarity with all Palestinians in advocating for their human rights. We condemn statements reaffirming Israels right to defend itself and view statements of this nature as onesided and irresponsible. Such statements perpetuate an ongoing and harmful pattern of complete disregard to the core issues that have created the conditions which led to this violence. APAC affirms that the death of civilians is never acceptable. However, the violence we are seeing today is sadly what Palestinians experience on a daily basis, whether it be through Israels crushing illegal blockade of Gaza, persistent settler attacks on Palestinian civilians, or Israels illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. Todays violence is a reminder of the consequences of a 75 year long unchecked occupation, continued expansion of illegal settlements, continued denial of Palestinians fundamental human rights, a brutal blockade, and an unrelenting system of apartheid. In the immediate term, we call on the Government of Canada, in partnership with the international community, to exercise all diplomatic efforts to deescalate the situation demand that Israel exercise restraint and remind Israel of its legal duties under international law as an occupying power to protect those living under its brutal occupation. Furthermore, we call on the Government of Canada to refrain from issuing provocative statements affirming Israels unequivocal right to defend itself. Courage is required to recognize that the international communitys pattern of reaffirming Israels right to defend itself has not contributed to improving the prospects for peace and only serves to provide Israel with the diplomatic cover to undertake heinous acts of violence against the Palestinian people. Lastly, we call on the Government of Canada, in partnership with the international community, to make resolving the IsraelPalestine issue a top international priority. Peace in the region remains elusive in part due to the international communitys refusal to make sincere efforts to address root causes and its failure to hold Israel accountable for its flagrant violation of international law. A solution can only be achieved with the full participation of the Palestinian people and through the upholding and equal application of international law and an end to the occupation. In the absence of this, we will remain trapped in this ongoing cycle of violence as the desire for freedom, and efforts to resist the denial of this freedom, should never be underestimated. On October 7, the Communist Party of Israel CPI and the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality Hadash courageously and truthfully put the full responsibility for the escalation of violence in the Israeli war against the Palestinians on the Netanyahu government. In a statement concerning the rapid escalation of military confrontation between Hamas and Israeli forces, they blame the criminal occupation policy of the Netanyahu government, underlining the grave dangers that it poses for the peace in the region. The fascist rightwing governments crimes to perpetuate the occupation are leading to a regional war that must be stopped. Even in difficult days like this we repeat and voice an unequivocal condemnation of any harm to innocent civilians, and call for their removal from the bloodshed. We send our condolences to all the families of the victims of the occupation, Arabs and Jews alike, the statement reads. CPI and Hadash put the full responsibility on the fascist rightwing government for the sharp and dangerous escalation of the last few hours, that cost the lives of many innocent citizens. At the end of a shocking week in which the settlers ran amok throughout the occupied territories under the auspices of their government, desecrated the AlAqsa Mosque and carried out another pogrom in Huwara, we woke up this morning to a very serious escalation, which endangers the entire region in a regional and dangerous war which the rightwing government has been fueling since its first day. Todays events show in what dangerous direction the Netanyahu government and the settlers are leading the entire region, and emphasize once again that there is no way to manage the conflict or resolve it militarily there is only one solution strive to end the occupation and recognize the legitimate demands and rights of the Palestinian people. The end of the occupation and the establishment of a just peace are a distinct and common interest of the two peoples in this country. CPI and Hadash express deep concern about the use of recent developments by the Netanyahu government to carry out a vengeful attack on the Gaza Strip and call on the international community and the countries of the region to intervene immediately to silence the drums of war and initiate moves that will lead to the promotion of a political solution. CPI and Hadash warn of revenge activities against the ArabPalestinian citizens of Israel, and especially the residents of the mixed cities and the unknown villages in the Negev who have already paid a high price due to the neglect of their lives by the state and the lack of infrastructure in the settlements. In this reality, it is the duty of the sane forces in Israel, Jews and Arabs alike, to raise a sharp and clear voice against any attempt to incite against entire populations or to take the law into ones own hands, and to promote joint activity, which signifies the aspiration for a normative life without occupation, discrimination and supremacy a life of peace, equality and true democracy for all. Saturday evening October 7, Member of the Knesset Ofer Cassif Hadash posted a video to social media Nothing justifies crimes and massacres as committed today in the south of Israel. But the writing was on the wall, as I warned for a long time We will pay a heavy price for the crimes of the occupation, the siege on Gaza and the arrogance of the racist Kahanist government. There is no military solution, only a political one the end of the occupation and Palestinian independence. On October 4, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights PCHR delivered an oral intervention during the 54th regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council UNHRC. The statement was delivered by Basel Alsourani, PCHRs International Advocacy Officer, under Agenda item 7 on Human Rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab Territories. It addressed Israeli apartheid, focusing on the statements made by Israeli National Security Minister, Itamar BenGvir, during a TV interview in which he publicly admitted to Israeli apartheid. During the interview, Itamar BenGvir stated that Israeli rights were more important than those of Palestinians, a statement which he refused to apologize for. The text of the oral statement continues Itamar Ben Gvirs statements reflect the enduring reality in the Occupied Palestinian Territory OPT and inside the Green Line as the Israeli government continues to impose a system of domination and oppression against Palestinians denying them their most basic rights, including their right to selfdetermination, in order to benefit Israeli Jews. This is not the first time that an Israeli minister has made such a statement. Several months earlier, Israeli Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, called for the wiping out of the Palestinian town of Howara. The existence of apartheid has become increasingly difficult to ignore considering the Israeli government policies, statements, and practices which clearly show an intent to pursue permanent annexation of Palestinian land based on Jewish supremacy. In addition, there has been growing recognition among Palestinian, Israeli, and International human rights organizations as well as experts, academics, and prominent individuals that the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as well as inside the Green Line amounts to apartheid. At the end of the statement, PCHR called on Member States of the UNHRC to recognize, condemn, and dismantle Israels apartheid system. PCHR also called on the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to include the crime against humanity of apartheid in his investigation into the situation and prosecute relevant perpetrators. On September 27, members of the Security Council received a brief of the UN SecretaryGeneral on the implementation of Security Council resolution 2334 2016 for the reporting period from June 15 to September 19 of this year. Security Council resolution 2334 2016 calls on Israel to immediately and completely cease all settlement activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and to fully respect all of its legal obligations in this regard. Settlement activity has, nevertheless, continued. Israeli authorities advanced plans for 6,300 housing units in Area C, including the retroactive legalization, under Israeli law, of three outposts near the settlement of Eli. In East Jerusalem, approximately 3,580 housing units were advanced. ... I remain deeply troubled by the unrelenting expansion of Israeli settlements and settlement outposts in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, with over 10,000 housing units advanced in this reporting period alone. Settlements further entrench the occupation, fuel violence, impede Palestinian access to their land and resources, and systematically erode the viability of a Palestinian State as part of a twoState solution. I reiterate that settlements have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law and United Nations resolutions. I call on the Government of Israel to cease all settlement activity and dismantle outposts immediately, in line with its obligations under international law. Demolitions and seizures of Palestinianowned structures continued across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Citing the lack of Israeliissued building permits, which are almost impossible for Palestinians to obtain, Israeli authorities, demolished, seized or forced people to demolish 238 structures, displacing 183 people, including 46 women and 91 children and 32 structures which were donor funded. Fiftynine schools, serving some 6,500 Palestinian students, are at risk of demolition. The demolition and seizure of Palestinian structures, including internationally funded humanitarian projects, entail numerous human rights violations and raise concerns about the risk of forcible transfer. I call upon the Government of Israel to end this practice, in line with its international obligations, and to allow Palestinian communities to build and address their development needs, the UN Secretary General said. The report further recorded the following Over the reporting period, 68 Palestinians, including 18 children, were killed by Israeli security forces during demonstrations, clashes, security operations, attacks or alleged attacks against Israelis, and other incidents. 2,830 Palestinians, including 30 women and 559 children, were injured. Of that number, 271 were injured by live ammunition and 2,119 by tear gas inhalation. In addition, two Palestinians were killed and 73 injured, including three women and 12 children, amid a high level of attacks by Israeli settlers. Israeli security forces carried out 1,042 searchandarrest operations in the West Bank, resulting in 1,504 Palestinians arrested, including 88 children. Israel currently holds 1,264 Palestinians in administrative detention, the highest number in over a decade. Security Council resolution 2334 2016 calls for the parties to refrain from acts of provocation, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric. Unfortunately, such acts continued. In an interview, an Israeli Minister said, My right and that of my wife and my children, to travel on the roads in Judea and Samaria, is more important than the freedom of movement for Arabs. A Member of the Israeli Knesset said that any Palestinian running away from an Israel Defense Forces soldier must be shot. A Palestinian who approaches an IDF soldier must also be shot, he added. An Israeli minister visited the Holy Sites on the Jewish commemoration day of Tisha Bav and called on Israelis to return to the sites and show our governance. The SecretaryGeneral called on Israel to abide by its obligations under international law, including with regard to the proportional use of force, and ensure thorough, independent and prompt investigations into all instances of possible excessive use of force, holding those responsible to account. ... I am disturbed by the multiple instances in which officials have used dangerous or racist rhetoric and engaged in incitement. The SecretaryGeneral said that he continues to remain committed to supporting Palestinians and Israelis to end the occupation and resolve the conflict in line with international law, relevant United Nations resolutions, and bilateral agreements in pursuit of the vision of two States Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous, viable, and sovereign Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security within secure and recognized borders, on the basis of the pre1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the shared capital of both States. For 30 years now, Israel has shown it has no intention of abiding by its obligations under international law and that the twostate solution was never its intention. The Palestinian people are courageously seeking an end to the occupation, the apartheid regime and the crimes of genocide committed against them. Photo Review Ottawa, October 8 With less than a days notice, more than 1,200 people, most of them young people, gathered at the Human Rights Monument in Ottawa to show their support for the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance. Speakers there included the Palestinian Youth Movement, Independent Jewish Voices, Palestinian Student Association University of Ottawa, and Labour for Palestine Canada. All the speakers called for support for the Palestinian people against the aggression and armed violence of the Zionist entity. They saluted the Palestinian resistance which has opened a chapter of struggle for the dignity and pride of the Palestinian people which is now responding to decades of continuous and repeated Zionist aggression against the Palestinian people. They denounced the hypocrisy of the Trudeau government and all political parties who support Israels right to defend itself while ignoring the plight of the Palestinian people caused by the Zionists criminality. They also cautioned everyone not to fall into the trap of condemning the victims of oppression and dictating how the Palestinian people should fight for their liberation. After hearing the speakers, the demonstration marched through downtown Ottawa and the Byward Market, past the U.S. Embassy and Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus office on Wellington Street. Slogans shouted called for the freedom of Palestine and affirmed that resistance is a right. The demonstration ended at the Human Rights Monument more than two hours after the rally began, with calls from the organizers to be ready to demonstrate again and continue actions in support of the Palestinian people. Montreal, October 8 At the call of the Palestinian Youth Movement, hundreds of people of all ages, most of them youth, rallied at Dorchester Square in downtown Montreal where a sea of Palestinian flags adorned the park. For close to an hour, people chanted in unison in French, English and Arabic From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free Free, Free Palestine Netanyahu, You Will See, Palestine Will Be Free Gaza, Gaza Resistance is Justified, When People are Occupied,Resistance Is Justified When People are Colonized Intifada, Intifada, Long Live Intifada There Is Only One Solution, Intifada Revolution Israel Terrorist, Trudeau Accomplice A young woman spoke to the crowd reminding everyone that People in Palestine have been under a blockade for more than 50 years. Under the brutality of the occupation, people have been denied their basic rights. The crowd answered back Shame She added, The arrogance of the occupiers, believing they can get away with anything because they have the backing of some of the most powerful countries in the world, ... The operations that have been going on for the last few days are to restore our dignity, and for all the Arabs of the world. We are here to celebrate that victory, .. to break that captivity that has been imposed on us by the Zionist entity ... to restore our rightful honour ... We are asking politicians to support us and to remind them that we are here to liberate our homeland, with our own hands. As members of the diaspora that live in Canada, in the heart of the enemy, we must remind ourselves to be patient, that wherever we go, we must not rest until every inch of Palestine is liberated For close to two hours the march travelled through the streets of downtown Montreal, with people chanting slogans and waving flags until they arrived at the Israeli consulate. The consulate was heavily guarded by police officers of the Sret du Qubec riot squad who pushed back anyone trying to go up the stairs leading to the entrance of the building. The crowd stayed on for another half hour. The organizers called on people to be ready to come out for another emergency rally when needed. Halifax, October 8 Toronto, October 7 For several hours, a group of Palestinian youth and supporters of the Palestinian resistance waved flags and hung a large banner stating Honk Your Horns for Palestine on an overpass straddling the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto. The honking of the horns was practically uninterrupted as motorists coming into and leaving the city showed their support, some waving and raising their fists. This support invigorated the youth who held their ground despite the efforts of the Toronto police to harass and intimidate them, and clearly reflected the broad support for the Palestinian peoples courage and their just cause. Toronto, October 9 More than 5,000 people participated in a rally and march in support of the Palestinian people organized by the Palestine Youth Movement. The action began at Nathan Phillips Square with the chanting of slogans including From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free Trudeau You Will See, Palestine Will Be Free The Only Solution, Intifada Revolution Intifada, Intifada, Long Live the Intifada, and others in Arabic and English. Following the rally, the participants marched up Bay Street stopping at intersections to chant and shout slogans. Along the route youth were front and centre along the way and leading the chants. Many Torontonians warmly saluted the action, many joining in. The action ended at the Israeli Consulate at Yonge and Bloor Street where the chanting of slogans continued for some time reflecting the spirit of the Palestinian people to continue their struggle until victory. Many denounced the statements of politicians like Ontario Premier Doug Ford and the mayor of Toronto, Olivia Chow, who outdid themselves in characterizing the actions called in solidarity with Palestine as glorifying this weekends indiscriminate violence. Chow tweeted that The rally to support Hamas at Nathan Phillips Square today is unsanctioned, without a permit and I unequivocally denounce it. Glorifying this weekends indiscriminate violence, including murder and kidnapping of women and children, by Hamas against Israeli civilians is deplorable. She remained silent about the crimes of the Zionists against women and children and the entire Palestinian people, all against international law including cutting electricity and shipments of food and water and medical supplies to Gaza and standards of human behaviour. Chow ended her statement with I am receiving updates from the Chief of Police, who assures me they will investigate and address any suspected incidents of hate. The spirit of the rally in Toronto was unequivocally in support of the unwavering determination of the Palestinian people to end the Israeli occupation and their treatment as less than human, with no rights. It applauded the Palestinian resistance for defying the constant repression and violence and the stand of the Zionists and their supporters that they are all powerful and can succeed in subduing the longsuffering Palestinian nation. London, October 9 Edmonton, October 8 Around 1,500 Palestinians and their supports held a militant rally in Castle Downs Park. Large numbers of youth participated, along with whole families, from the small children holding Palestinian flags to the older generation who hold the memories of being forced from their homes when they themselves were small children. A huge Palestinian flag covered the hillside where everyone gathered to hear the speakers. Speaker after speaker upheld the right of the people of Palestine and all oppressed people to resist. They spoke of the crimes committed by the Zionists, and their determination to End the Occupation. Again and again the speakers were met with Free Palestine From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free and other chants. Following the speakers everyone joined in to hold a militant march through the park.

By Benjamin Bouchard, Universit Laval Daniel Nadeau, Universit Laval, and Florent Domine, Universit Laval For more than six months a year, Quebecs boreal forest is covered in a thick blanket of snow. While this is essential for the balance of our ecosystems, for the people living downstream from forested watersheds the snow can be like a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. The major floods of spring 2023 in the Charlevoix region show why the snow cover poses a risk. Last winter, the Rivire du Gouffre watershed, of which nearly 75 per cent is covered by forests, accumulated a large amount of snow. The melting of this snow cover combined with an extremely intense rainfall event helped push the river out of its bed, causing unprecedented flooding in BaieSaintPaul. As part of my PhD at Universit Laval, in collaboration with Sentinel North, I am looking at the impact of snow cover properties on watershed hydrology in the boreal forest. Rain as an energy carrier As we saw in the spring of 2023, rain events combined with snow cover can lead to a sudden rise in river water levels. One reason for this is that rainwater transfers heat to the snow.",0

Will the average homeowner be able to afford catastrophe insurance as a predisaster risk management mechanism in the near future Donaldson said that without catastrophe insurance, the recovery process would become even more challenging, which would produce a drag on economic recovery. She said the importance of catastrophe insurance for countries in natural disaster corridors cannot be underestimated.","Extreme weather events brought on by an unfolding climate crisis are expected to trigger a significant reduction in insurance coverage for Jamaican homeowners, industry experts are warning. Already, major insurers in the United States, a main market for local insurance companies reinsurers, have announced their intent to cease writing coverage for some regions because of troubling weather patterns caused by climate change. The ripple effect will be an increase in premiums and deductibles for some homeowners while others are expected to be priced out of catastrophe insurance coverage. International reinsurers, the finance companies that cover risks taken on by local insurance companies, want more and are moving to other markets to do business where Jamaican insurance companies fail to increase coverage rates, The Gleaner reported months ago. Approximately 90 per cent of the premiums charged by local insurers on property is ceded to reinsurers and those funds are put in a pool to cover payout from a disaster. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. For several years, Sharon Donaldson, president of the Insurance Association of Jamaica, has said the Caribbean has experienced an increasing frequency in the number of natural disasters that have resulted in significant damage to properties. She said general insurance companies and reinsurers have funded these economic losses caused by natural disasters windstorms and earthquakes for many years. These pool funds are rapidly declining and have been said in some quarters to be at an alltime low. The result is catastrophe risk insurance is less available and more expensive, she told The Gleaner. Donaldson said 2023, even as it draws to a close, saw one of the most challenging renewal seasons for the entire region to include the Caribbean and North America. She said many reinsurers reduced capacity to the region while others withdrew entirely from the market. Given the continuing negative impact of climate change on the frequency of natural disasters, I dont think the reinsurance capacity for the upcoming year will improve. I believe that commercial businesses will continue to purchase insurance, but homeowners may find the price a tad too steep and opt to selfinsure, Donaldson theorised. Will the average homeowner be able to afford catastrophe insurance as a predisaster risk management mechanism in the near future Probably not, she added, noting that postdisaster may be burdensome on the community, the economy, and the family. Donaldson said that without catastrophe insurance, the recovery process would become even more challenging, which would produce a drag on economic recovery. She said the importance of catastrophe insurance for countries in natural disaster corridors cannot be underestimated. I suspect business owners and homeowners will continue to face difficult choices on insurance spend, said Donaldson. The 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season produced 14 named storms winds of 39mph or greater, of which eight became hurricanes winds of 74mph or greater and two intensified to major hurricanes with winds reaching 111mph or greater, according to the Washington, D.C.based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA. The NOAA is a scientific and regulatory agency. The 2021 season saw 21 storms, ranking as the thirdbusiest Atlantic season on record, behind 2020s unprecedented 30 named storms, and the 27 named storms and one unnamed storm that developed in 2005. I dont think people understand the extent to which property insurance underpins all formal commercial activity, environmentalist Diana McCaulay noted. McCaulay, whose background is also rooted in general insurance, said given the current climate crisis that is unfolding in several kinds of hazards windstorms, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding, wildfires it is not surprising that insurance is becoming more expensive and less available in regions of the world that are particularly subject to these hazards. Yet as I look around Jamaica, we continue to build as if we are still in the climate of the past. Will we be able to buy property insurance for hotels on the coast in the near future Will our people be able to withstand the heat, which is made worse by all the concrete and hard structures we are laying down I dont know, but this summer is a true wakeup call for what lies ahead, she said. Beachfront properties and others closer to the sea are considered a problematic type of risk, Managing Director of BCIC Jamaica Peter Levy told The Gleaner, noting that they carry a 50 per cent higher rate. Still, the company has not seen a falloff in its portfolio and has seen a commensurate movement with respect to coverage for floodprone or lowlying areas that would run on average 25 per cent higher in terms of premium. I think thats partly because of climate change. Sea level rise is the expected outcome of climate change that a lot of people are aware of whereas changing rain patterns and flood frequencies is not something that has received the same amount of public attention. So I would say its the coastal risks rather than the floodprone risks that have seen reductions in appetite from the insurance market. I would also say at the same time, though, that we havent seen people opting out of the insurance market. In fact, weve seen a higherthannormal level in increases of value, he said. kimone.francisgleanerjm.com",1

Additionally, VFRS will also be receiving fire suppression equipment up to 80,000, specifically made for electric vehicle EV fires. Its a blanket that is pulled over the vehicle to help contain the heat and the gas from the fire, said fire chief David Lind. And the other tool we need actually hooks up to water. We place it under the vehicle and we lift it up into the area where the battery boxes are located and then flood that area with water. Lind mentioned how fires from EVs use a considerable amount of water, more so than a gas vehicle fire. With a gas vehicle, we can essentially just use water from our fire truck reservoir, not even needing a hydrant, Lind added. A tethered heavy duty drone, made to reach distances as high at 200 feet, was also accepted by council, for use by VFRS. The drone would be able to be flown into controlled airspaces during emergencies, like the recent McDougall Creek Wildfire. This specific drone is in use at other emergency services communities, Lind explained. The heavy price tag, up to 50,000 was initially questioned by Coun. Kelly Fehr, before the explanation by Lind. All funds for VFS will be discussed at the 2024 budget deliberations. Cannabis smell update After a resident brought forth a petition demanding enforcement of the cannabis odour control act at the previous council meeting, council has seemingly listened. The company, Avant Ventures has seen 44 complaints levied their way by Bylaw Compliance. However, Health Canada is responsible for action upon these complaints and since its federally regulated, there has not been any changes. Council approved a new motion, to write a letter to Health Canada requesting that they expedite the review of Avant Ventures, to be looked at at the next council meeting. I think we also send them Health Canada the number of complaints to them and continue to write them letters until the issue is dealt with, said Coun. Kari Gares. Our hands are tied, said Coun. Brian Quiring. We can do our best to work with the business owner but we cant force compliance and Health Canada has a responsibility. It should happen sooner rather than later, as the residents are being impacted. The letter will also be distributed to MP Mel Arnold. Roster Sports Club upgrade An application to increase the occupancy load at Rosters Sports Club, from 95 to 140 patrons, was approved without any discussion. Two residents who lived near the club submitted emails expressing concern for the proposal, out of the 136 property owners who were contacted. Roster believes that the structural change is not anticipated to have it be operated in a manner that is contrary to its primary purpose of a sports club. Funds for Carnival and OKeefe Grant funding requests from both the Vernon Winter Carnival and OKeefe Ranch Interior Heritage Society were both accepted by council. Carnival is seeking 10,000 in what is a continuation of funding, according to a city report. Since 2009, the City of Vernon has provided the VWC a grant in the amount of 10,000 to assist with its annual carnival. The grant is provided for annually in the budget, and for 2024, the tourism department has already agreed to be a sponsor for the society, and the city paid 10,000 for that sponsorship in August 2023. The request for 10,000 is in addition to the sponsorship amount and the funds have been included in the 2024 budget. Deliberations on the funds will be had in December when council dissects the upcoming budget. OKeefe is seeking 150,000. The city already annually includes 50,000 for the society, funded by taxation.

Freezing and expanding can cause cracking that can potentially flood your house. During a cold snap, if youre just away for the day or if your furnace shuts down, it can help to leave a faucet on a bit. If you turn your water on to at least a trickle, the water will be less likely to freeze because its moving. He cautioned not to just turn your water on and not pay attention to it, but When it gets really cold, thats a good emergency measure. If youre going away for longer, the cheapest solution is to have someone check on your house daily. Kevin suggested Make sure they actually walk into the utility room and check things, look at the furnace, the water heater and where the water comes in. Dont set your temperature lower than 15C, especially if the weather might get to minus 20. Kevin explains that it might be 10 upstairs, but maybe downstairs its a few degrees cooler, and in a back corner where pipes might be, the temperature could get a lot closer to zero. Having someone come by isnt always an option, and some people go away for extended periods of time. Technology can let you keep tabs on things while youre not home.

The second phase of the project is already underway and will be completed by the end of the month. It involves an extension of the Mountview Dike by 60 meters and replacement of an undersized culvert under Mount McLean Dr. Construction on this 415,000 project is being undertaken by Gally Equipment Services and funds are coming from city reserves. The 700 millimeter culvert was undersized and didnt have enough capacity during some storms, which contributed to localized flooding at the edge of Max Turyk Community Centre. It is being replaced with a 1,800 millimeter diameter culvert. Phase three, which will be designed by McElhanney and financed by a Union of British Columbia Municipalities grant totaling 1,980,300, will be finished by next summer. The City awarded a design contract to McElhanney at a council meeting on Sept. 26 and construction will be tendered out next spring. It will see a portion of the dike altered to meet current standards. The dike will be raised approximately half a meter to the approved flood construction level, and the top will be widened and the sides altered where necessary to make a more gentle slope. A section of land at the junction of Elk River and Coal Creek will be strengthened to protect it from water erosion through a process known as armouring, which involves placing material, usually rocks, along the shoreline. Erosion that has occurred at the Coal Creek Bin Wall will be investigated. The bin wall is made of steel bins, which are filled with rocks and gravel and capped with cement. If the rocks and gravel are found to have eroded at the bottom, the wall will be repaired. The City initially hoped to complete the whole project using a 750,000 grant from the Union of British Columbia Municipalities that was allocated three years ago but this goal was not met and the project was instead divided into three phases, the first of which began 2020, when the dike was extended by 220metres. These projects were launched in response to the flood in June 2013. The existing dike was built before this event and heightening and widening it will prevent future floods from impacting the Mountview neighbourhood like it did that year. The dike borders Sharpes Field and the eastern edge of James White Park, near the Mountview neighbourhood. City of Fernie project engineer Joanna Line mentioned that the height of a dike is usually calculated by measuring the height of the worst flood that has affected a given area, while also accounting for local variation and debris. Flood Construction Level is typically the height of the 1 in 200 year flood event of that river, plus 10 per cent for future climate uncertainty and a 0.6 meters of freeboard, however, for areas where worse flood events have occurred, the flood construction level is calculated using the height of that flood event, plus the 10 per cent and freeboard, she explained in an email to The Free Press. In theory, there should be 0.6 meters of dry land between the top of the water and the top of the dike. Just think, if there are waves or large debris that is pulled from the banks of the river or creek upstream and get wedged or placed somewhere else downstream during a flood event, that could cause localized higher levels of water. Freeboard gives a margin of extra storage capacity, she added. gfrans15 newsroomthefreepress.ca Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.",1

Marshall says, Music, for me, is medicine, therapy, and connection. Coproduced by Jeshua and Todd Rosenberg, The Flood features Jeshua Marshall vocals, guitar, Seth Acquarolo guitar, keyboards, Davey Hemm bass, Todd Rosenberg drums, Miguel Mendoza trumpet, and Wendi Wampler clarinet. Originally from Canada, Marshall grew up enveloped in religious orthodoxy yet was drawn toward secular music, especially the extreme ethos of pure punk. When he was 16 years old, he and his brother Jamin formed a punk band called Larry and His Flask, which later became famous for its reckless finesse. After touring nonstop, in 2019, Larry and His Flask came to an end, opening the door for Marshall to explore new sonic milieus. Encompassing ten tracks, The Flood begins with Water, a song written by Willy Tea Taylor about Knights Ferry, California. According to Marshall, Knights Ferry is a very special place to me, a home away from home. As a result, I fell in love with this song and learned it directly from Willy while I was touring through Scandinavia while playing bass for him in 2017. Water opens on a funky rhythm topped by tasty, bluesy guitars and blatting, sleazy horns. Marshalls evocative vocals imbue the lyrics with delicious tones. Entry points on the album include the reggaeflavored title track, with its skiffing guitars and onedrop beat. Braying brass gives the melody bright accents as well as a tropical feel. Unbound rolls out on a pushing, Americana rhythm as light, gleaming guitars suffuse the melody with creamy, shimmering colors. The feel and mood of the tune are upbeat and buoyant. Scrumptious, Spanishlace horns open Closed Doors, which segues into a driving countryrock melody brimming with wild energy and psychedelic whooshing inflections. Tinted with reggae hues, Swing blends big band energy with rollicking jazz aromas and wickedly sumptuous brass tones. The closing track, Wave, travels on sensuous blues textures, rolling on a captivating, swaying rhythm as Marshalls vocals imbue the lyrics with lush, alluring timbres. With its amalgamation of styles ranging from funk to reggae to Americana, The Flood reveals delicious wrinkles of aural flair. The Flood Track Listing 1. Water 2. The Flood 3.

In the early stages of his doctoral degree, Robert Chlumsky BASc 15, MASc 18 had doubts about whether he had made the right choice to return to school. There were days Robert wondered why he had left a fulltime job as a water resources consulting engineer, particularly when he wasnt successful in applying But now as a recent recipient of the Jain Family Award for Entrepreneurship, he is no longer questioning coming back to the University of Waterloo for his third environmental engineering degree. For Robert, the award made possible by a gift from the Vijay Anand Foundation to encourage student entrepreneurship at Waterloo is providing financial assistance and, perhaps more importantly, confirmation that his research has significant potential. Before I received the award, I definitely had some moments of selfdoubt, he said. Part of receiving the award was validation that I had made the right decision to pursue a PhD. It was during his time as a municipal engineering consultant that Robert discovered the need for new floodplain mapping technology. I had seen how things are done and practised and I had some ideas about how the technology could be improved, he said. Floodplain mapping is becoming an increasingly important issue with climate change where more intense flooding is expected, not less. Together with civil and environmental engineering professors James Craig and Bryan Tolson, Robert is developing Blackbird, a more effective method for floodplain mapping. Unlike flood maps used today, Blackbirds will be both realtime and twodimensional and could substantially impact flood mitigation and emergency response, potentially leading to lower costs and risk to life. Shortly after he began his PhD in 2020, Robert launched Heron Hydrologic, a company that provides training and other services related to hydrologic modelling, calibration and data analysis. Craig, Roberts MASc supervisor, and Tolson, his doctoral supervisor, are also part of Heron Hydrologic. The father of three under three has a fourthdegree black belt and both practises and teaches karate at Legacy Martial Arts and Fitness in Kitchener, where he has been a member for over 24 years. In addition to impressive time management skills, Robert credits the support of his wife and awards such as the Jain Family Award for Entrepreneurship for allowing him to work on his PhD and keep up with all the other professional and personal parts of his busy life. He expects to complete his doctorate in spring 2024 and then work full time on Blackbird and Heron Hydrologic. The University of Waterloo is the right school to provide the best opportunities to succeed, Robert said. Im looking forward to what the future will bring.

How to be a board member, and free fitness classes for staff A message from the University of Waterloo Staff Association UWSA. Volunteering to be on the board of directors for a charity or notforprofit organization can be intimidating. Board Foundations is a 60 to 90minute virtual workshop for UWaterloo staff that focuses on the key concepts and responsibilities of board leadership, with a goal to answer questions and make board roles more accessible. Participants will learn about the legal roles and responsibilities of boards and board members. The session will provide an overview of fiduciary, strategic, and generative leadership responsibilities, and will touch on the legislation that provides the framework for governance in Ontario. An organization is strongest when it includes diverse perspectives. A boards culture needs to celebrate diversity of voices and enable everyone to safely contribute. The workshops will apply an antioppression lens on governance and help participants understand their role in developing an inclusive organizational culture. This is a new component that will be beneficial to those who attended the workshop last year. Registration is open on Portal there are five offerings of the workshop between October 16 and March 21, so you can choose a date that works for you. Funding for this workshop is provided by the Staff Excellence Fund. Other currently funded projects you can attend include Workplace Yoga, Pilates Party, and daily fitness and wellness programming from Athletics. Any staff member can submit a proposal for funding at any time.",1

Across the province, this years wildfire season was particularly harrowing, leading to tens of thousands of people evacuating, hundreds of homes lost and a long and difficult season for those on the front lines. Were doing everything we can to prepare for next year. Thats why, in addition to this legislation, our government has launched an expert task force on emergencies to determine how we can better support evacuees, frontline workers and volunteers and apply the lessons we have learned to prepare for the 2024 wildfire season. By engaging frontline workers, community members, First Nations, local governments, farmers and industries that faced challenges during the 2023 wildfire season, the task force will provide actionoriented advice to government and partners on how we can improve for future emergencies. The safety of British Columbians and protecting our diverse and beautiful landscape will always be a priority for our government. We know that we cant predict the future, but we are doing the work now to be prepared and strengthen our provinces resilience for years to come.

During her undergrad, she joined the Waterloo Architecture Students Association WASA and got involved in research work as an assistant with the Buoyant Foundation Project a notforprofit organization founded by Waterloo architecture professor Dr. Elizabeth English.

This has shaped my masters thesis topic to focus on flood mitigation amphibious architecture in Canada.Holder is still part of the Buoyant Foundation Project team, now in the role of project manager. Regardless of where her important work takes her, Holder knows that the connections shes made at Waterloo will stay with her.","When she was 16 years old, Alexa Megan Holder spent a month camping and canoeing in Northern Ontario. She loved it so much that she became a wilderness guide with the YMCA, taking kids between six and 16 years old on river trips. Her recreational love of wild waters grew into an academic interest that guided her towards Waterloos Faculty of Engineering for a Bachelor of Architectural Studies BAS. Holder crosses the stage at convocation this fall to mark the completion of her undergraduate degree, though her studies at Waterloo will continue. Holder recently began her Master of Architecture MArch degree in the Collaborative Water Program, with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council SSHRC. For her thesis, she plans to focus on how building design can mitigate flood related issues and disasters. Paddling together Overseen by the Universitys Water Institute, the Collaborative Water Program involves 11 academic units to deliver the most interdisciplinary water graduate program in Canada. For Holder, this opportunity to focus her research on water, and work with students from other disciplines, is invaluable. University studies are typically siloed into faculties, Holder says. You dont often get a chance to collaborate with other disciplines, share knowledge and ideas, and engage with different viewpoints at least not formally. And yet in practice, a lot of what we do as architects is an interdisciplinary effort that can involve engineers, designers, archeologists, policy makers, social workers, urban planners and more. Interdisciplinary academic experience is critical to elevate our research and our work. I believe it will help prepare us and many other professionals for the big issues that we hope to address in the coming years. Getting involved Holder intentionally pursued a wellrounded university experience that went beyond academics. During her undergrad, she joined the Waterloo Architecture Students Association WASA and got involved in research work as an assistant with the Buoyant Foundation Project a notforprofit organization founded by Waterloo architecture professor Dr. Elizabeth English. I wanted to learn more about what research in architecture looks like, Holder says. The Buoyant Foundation Project was a perfect fit for me as it investigates how amphibious technologies can retrofit housing to better withstand rising water levels and flooding. This has shaped my masters thesis topic to focus on flood mitigation amphibious architecture in Canada. Holder is still part of the Buoyant Foundation Project team, now in the role of project manager. She credits her undergraduate experience with the foundation, as well as her five coop work terms, with helping her develop her capabilities and confidence. She worked in Rotterdam, Elora, Toronto, Victoria and New York an exciting mix of local and international exposure to different ways of living and working. I did a lot of hiking and rock climbing in Victoria, not so much in New York, Holder explains. The two cities are worlds apart, so it was great to experience both and get a better idea of what and where suits me before I start looking for a fulltime job. Changing currents Once shes completed her masters degree, Holder wants to work in sustainability and climate change disaster mitigation, and is open to roles as either an academic researcher or an architect in the field. Regardless of where her important work takes her, Holder knows that the connections shes made at Waterloo will stay with her. Our class of 2023 is a very closeknit group, she says. The School of Architecture campus is small which makes getting to know each other easy. Most of us in my cohort are not from the area so when we were firstyear students, we grabbed our orientation packs and went looking for housing together. By the end of that first day, Id made some good friends, including my current roommate. We moved in together in our second year and still live together. I imagine a lot of new firstyear students are still settling in and figuring things out. Change is challenging but its amazing to discover what youre made of. For me, getting involved in areas outside my course work was hugely rewarding, introducing me to interesting ideas, experiences and people. Thanks to my undergraduate degree, I feel grounded and ready for this next adventure.",1

Lind explained that EV fires can be quite difficult to put out and require a tremendous amount of water. A lot of equipment is a blanket, if you will, that basically is pulled over the vehicle that helps contain the heat and the off gassing, from the fire, said Lind. And the other tool actually hooks up to water ... and our standard fire hoses.

Will the events of this past summer convince everyone that climate is a top priority","As Canadians gathered for Thanksgiving this year, the extreme heat of the summer and early fall was not far from many of our minds. This unprecedented heat has melted away the last traces of climate change denial, as the true costs reveal themselves. Though climate policy remains a political hot potato, the Canadian debate has finally and definitively shifted from whether theres a serious need for a credible policy to how best to address it. As opposed to previous years, where extreme weather events though horrible were sporadic and regional, the summer of 2023 brought consistent and widespread horrors from around the world to our TV screens for months on end. Extreme floods wreaked havoc, as did wildfires, and some places were flooding and on fire at the same time. Because smoke doesnt respect borders, people hundreds of kilometres away were impacted by fires in other countries. And from east to west and north to south in our big, complicated country, many communities were negatively affected by extreme heat, floods and fires in unprecedented ways. Significantly, many media reports of these disasters explicitly linked them to climate change another change from previous years when climate change was often not mentioned as a factor. In 2023, the public was left with no doubt as to causality. As one example, the scientific experts at World Weather Attribution calculated that climate change more than doubled the likelihood of extreme fire weather conditions in Eastern Canada Climate change made the cumulative severity of Qubecs 2023 fire season to the end of July around 50 per cent more intense, and seasons of this severity at least seven times more likely to occur. Hydro plan helps Quebec rise to the climate challenge and stay competitive Though economists have long warned of the high cost being exacted by climate changedriven extreme weather, this summer, those calculations became far more real and close to home. For instance, the B.C. government estimated that so far this year, firefighting has cost the province 770 million, blowing away any previous years total. Layering on top the health costs exacted by wildfire smoke, that figure would be much higher, with such costs estimated at more than 1 billion for one week in June in Ontario alone. The City of Halifax estimated a cleanup bill of 20 million after a year that included a hurricane, fires and floods. There are two more summers until the mandatory date of the next federal election. Canadians are concerned about climate change impacts and expect the government to act to protect us from them, writes Rick Smith ClimateInstit cdnpoli ClimateRisk As perhaps the most extreme example of huge, new costs, this summer marked the acceleration of insurance companies around the world warning that climate change will render many properties increasingly uninsurable. State Farm, the largest homeowner insurance company in California, announced it would stop accepting new applications, including all business and personal lines property and casualty insurance. The group representing Canadian insurers warned that rates could skyrocket, or a lot of Canadians could be denied coverage if they live in areas where these extreme weather events typically happen. In Australia, home insurance rates jumped 28 per cent in the past year, according to the Actuaries Institute, which warned, Based on science, we expect these home insurance affordability pressures are likely to continue to worsen due to climate change. Homeowners have started to sit up and take notice. In the U.K., half of homeowners reported being concerned about climate change driving up their insurance rates.

To fulfil that recommendation, MNRF will be leading the flood strategy commitment to establish a provincial urban flooding work group, Rolf von den BaumenClark told the committee. I dont know what the Urban Flooding Working Group is Are we developing an Urban Flooding Policy","After a yearslong backandforth, the government has now convened an urban flooding working group. EDITORS NOTE This article originally appeared on The Trillium, a new Village Media website devoted exclusively to covering provincial politics at Queens Park. In April, Ontario promised to create a working group on flooding. In June, the responsible ministers office appeared to have never heard of it. But yes as of October, it does exist, the ministry now co Rdnfirms. Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry MNRF thendeputy minister Monique Rolf von den BaumenClark made the pledge on April 3, saying her ministry would take the lead on an intragovernmental working group to address urban flooding. The group was to be a response to the auditor generals 2022 report, which found a lack of leadership on the file. In a legislative committee discussing the AG report, Rolf von den BaumenClark said the group would be made up of the Ministries of Natural Resources and Forestry, Environment, Conservation and Parks, Municipal Affairs and Housing, Infrastructure and Transportation, and some municipalities. It would identify roles and responsibilities related to urban flooding, determine new or emerging urban flooding issues and develop a provincial framework for urban flooding policy, she said. To fulfil that recommendation, MNRF will be leading the flood strategy commitment to establish a provincial urban flooding work group, Rolf von den BaumenClark told the committee. NDP climate critic Peter Tabuns asked when the working group would be convened and when it would start writing reports. Rolf von den BaumenClark initially refused to offer a timeline but said, We will start this year, after Tabuns pressed her. Just two months later, the ministers top policy staffer appeared not to have heard of the project. According to internal emails received through a freedomofinformation request, a ministry staffer contacted several employees in Natural Resources and Forestry Minister Graydon Smiths office on June 1. She was looking for approval to get back to the legislative committee with a more specific timeline. Proposed Answer The provincial urban flooding working group will be established this summer, with deliberations to be held through this fall and winter and a final frameworkreport to be completed in the spring of 2024, the ministry staffer wrote. A response came the next morning from Smiths director of policy, Matthew Stubbings. I dont know what the Urban Flooding Working Group is he wrote. Are we developing an Urban Flooding Policy Please advice. sic A couple of hours later, Stubbings asked the ministry to tone down its proposed committee answer because Smith and his staff didnt know enough about the group. I dont think we offer any time commitments without the ministers office and minister being briefed on this groups terms of reference and broader policy objectives, he wrote. I propose we change the language to something like the... Ministry will be considering establishing a working group in the coming months... On Thursday, ministry spokesperson Richard Mullin said the group has been established and will indeed meet this fall. Ontarios 2020 flooding strategy pledged to establish a working group with provincial agencies to identify custodians for flood mapping information, including base data, with clear roles and responsibilities. In the auditor generals report, she notes that the ministry had drafted terms of reference and invitations to participate in the group back in 2020, following a report from a Special Advisor on Flooding that recommended its creation but it still hadnt been created as of 2022. The province is well aware of the need to do more to address this issue, thenauditor general Bonnie Lysyk wrote, noting that four reports and plans had made recommendations. Yet the province has never clarified provincial roles for addressing and coordinating actions needed to alleviate the risk of urban flooding, with the result that gaps in responsibility persist and actions and commitments have never been implemented. The government seemed to backtrack on its plan to create a flood group after Lysyks report. Four ministries told her theyd work within their own mandates on flooding, but none agreed to develop a provincial framework that clearly identifies and assigns roles and responsibilities for urban flood management, Lysyk wrote. Floodprone communities have called for more help from higher levels of government, singling out the siloed nature of support. Some say governments could learn something from the Americans, whose Army Corps of Engineers is creating a plan to protect the shorelines of eight states along the Great Lakes. Thenenvironment minister David Piccini promised in August to call on the feds to create a similar plan. He also said there would be an announcement from Ottawa on that front in the fall, but the feds said they werent sure what he was talking about.",1

Keenleyside, Duncan and Mica to better support ecosystems, Indigenous cultural values and socioeconomic interests here in the B.C. Basin. Photo courtesy Columbia Basin Trust As someone who has called Castlegar home since childhood, I am very disturbed to see the current situation in the Arrow Lakes Reservoir. This region is ingrained in my own personal history my family camped, swam, fished and boated in the lakes, close to our home. These waters have been part of my life for more than half a century and, like many others who call this place home, Im deeply troubled by what weve seen over the past few months. I wish there was an easy way to fix this. I have shared your frustration over the summer and into fall, watching the impact on recreation, tourism, our economy, and our fish and wildlife habitats. As you may know, there are several factors at play here the first is a severe drought that has covered more than 80 of the province this summer, which we cannot control. Its also vital that a certain amount of water is held in Kinbasket Reservoir to meet B.C.s anticipated electricity demand for winter. The other factor is the Columbia River Treaty, which requires B.C. to send a specific volume of water to the United States at certain times of year for flood protection and, in the case of this summer, powergeneration purposes. As troubling as the situation has become this summer, it has drawn attention to the treaty, which is a positive thing. The treaty has been a part of the Columbia Basin for almost 60 years, and all of us know that there is a critical need to improve it. Canada, B.C. and the Ktunaxa, Secwepemc and Syilx Okanagan Nations are striving to modernize the treaty through the negotiation process. Though I am not at the negotiating table, as minister responsible for the Columbia River Treaty, I am in frequent contact with the B.C. treaty team and federal and Indigenous leaders to emphasize what needs to change. One of our key goals is to gain more flexibility for how B.C. operates its treaty dams Hugh L. Keenleyside, Duncan and Mica to better support ecosystems, Indigenous cultural values and socioeconomic interests here in the B.C. Basin. B.C.s negotiating team has shared photos and stories from Arrow Lakes Reservoir this summer with their American counterparts to illustrate how important this additional flexibility is. The letters we receive, the photos and posts we see on social media, the news reports, all of this strengthens our negotiating position to create a modernized agreement that reduces these types of impacts in the future. To specifically tackle the situation in Arrow Lakes Reservoir, I will be taking part in a virtual information session on Oct. 18 at 6 p.m. Pacific time. I will be joined by representatives from the Canadian Columbia River Treaty negotiating team and BC Hydro, who will share information about the difficult conditions were facing this year and whats being done to reduce these types of impacts in the future. This session is just the latest step in a decadelong engagement process led by the provincial governments Columbia River Treaty team. We have been engaging with Indigenous Nations, local governments and residents since 2012 to not only hear how the treaty impacted them, but to find out how it could be improved in the future. We have connected with people through more than 40 inperson community meetings, virtual sessions, social media, newsletters, emails, letters and oneonone phone calls. I encourage you to read engagement reports from 2013, 2018 and 2019 to learn what weve heard from each community, at httpsengage.gov.bc.cacolumbiarivertreatyengagementprocess Before any agreement on a modernized Columbia River Treaty is finalized, we will return to the basin to explain what is being proposed and seek feedback. In the meantime, I look forward to speaking to you at the Arrow Lakes Reservoir information session on Oct. 18, from 6 p.m. until 730 p.m. Pacific time, and 7 p.m. until 830 p.m. Mountain time via Zoom webinar.

And, despite rain and lower temperatures in recent days, several months of moisture are needed to break a drought. Usually we receive between six and eight inches of precipitation throughout the growing season which is well needed and well used, and this year was significantly less than that. It was between one to two inches of rain during the growing season, so it was definitely less than what was needed, explained Jason Miller with the Raymond Irrigation District. Calgary continues to see record low levels in the Bow and Elbow Rivers, and a statement from Calgary Water Services says, those restrictions are in place to help sustain Calgarys water supply in the Glenmore reservoir something Miller says is essential to helping Alberta survive and thrive. They help mitigate flooding when its a rain event, it mitigates drought events like weve had.

The 2021 season was one of the worst with production at its lowest in more than a decade. Dry conditions have accelerated the push for effective irrigation systems across the country. In Alberta, in 2020, the province and the federal government through the Canada Infrastructure Bank announced a 932million project to rehabilitate older irrigation equipment in the province, as well as construct or enlarge up to four offstream irrigation storage reservoirs.

So far since the start of the conflict X has identified and removed hundreds of Hamasaffiliated accounts from the platform, Yaccarino said in a letter posted on X.

Here are some tips to make sure you have the right coverage and amount of insurance. Factors that influence the price of insurance Insurance cost is always subject to a number of factors, including the type of business, aspects of the building you occupy and the commercial vehicles you use. The key factor taken into account are Business activities Products and services Annual income Area served deliveries, transporting goods, etc. The value of goods in inventory and equipment Building Features age, type, materials, etc. Location Surrounding area flood zones, proximity to public services, etc. Type of neighbourhood industrial, commercial, residential Added protection measures linked alarm system, sprinklers, surveillance system with camera, etc. Commercial vehicles Type of vehicle Its use delivery, transporting goods, etc. Number of drivers and their driving record The territory covered The importance of choosing the right protection Take the time to list the coverages you need or may need when youre getting ready to sign or renew your business insurance policy. These questions will help you better identify what you need to consider What kinds of occurrences might impact your operations How much is your business worth, including commercial property building and its contents Do you work with your hands or do you provide consulting services Do you sell your products online or in a store Do clients come and meet with you at your workplace Do you require a commercial vehicle for your business Tips for getting a fair premium, and even saving Here are some tips to reduce your business insurance costs while maintaining sufficient coverage. Review your coverage needs and choices. Your company changes and so do its needs. Its useful to regularly review your coverage in light of your companys current needs. Note that it is important to be honest about your income when requesting a quote. That way youll avoid unpleasant surprises in the event of a claim. Also make sure that the cost to rebuild the building is consistent with the insured value in your policy. Combine your products Combining coverage can reduce your premium. An entrepreneur who owns several businesses for example, real estate assets will benefit from insuring them with a single insurer. Monitor your financial health Your personal credit score can affect your business insurance. Think about your location Geographic region affects premiums. A less densely populated area can reduce costs. Avoid cutting costs at any cost. In times of inflation, it can be very tempting to temporarily remove certain coverages to lighten the budget. But remember that what you sacrifice in prevention, you gain in increased risk and vulnerability. The goal is to have the right coverage to ensure your companys longterm viability at the right price.

OUTLOOK The final day of September marked the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation in Canada, and in the town of Outlook, events held to mark the occasion helped local students gain more understanding of the days significance and also took a lot of emotion out of grown adults. On Thursday, September 28 at the Bounty Theatre, Grade 8 students from Outlook High School were joined by a few other adults in witnessing the presentation held by George Fayant, a Mtis man born and raised in southern Saskatchewan near the QuAppelle Valley. Fayants presentation to everyone was centered on the history and the significance of the Red River Cart, which he has been building for 25 years. Fayant builds the carts in various scales and he routinely gives presentations and workshops on the history of these carts, including how they were built using antique tools. George Fayant spoke to students and others about the history of the Red River cart. Photo Derek RuttleThe Outlook The Red River cart was a mode of transportation used by Mtis people in the Prairies during the settlement of the West in the midto late1800s to carry loads across distances. The name of the cart derives from the Red River, along which the Red River Colony 181270, inhabited mainly by Mtis peoples, was settled. One of the more interesting aspects about these carts is that theyre completely held together by connecting joints in the wood rather than spikes or nails, allowing them to be disassembled at any time. This would be useful to the people who used them generations ago, as in addition to its use as a transportation vessel, the cart served as a temporary home during long trips. Talking about the history of the cart, George also touched on a number of other items, such as beaver pelts, showing everyone a top hat that was constructed out of the material. Discussing the aspect of trading, Fayant explained that any transaction being carried out had to be an equal one. For example, if you had a number of animal pelts to trade and you were seeking a rifle, then you had to match the height of the gun in pelts in order to acquire the weapon. Students actually put together a wheel for the cart. Photo Derek RuttleThe Outlook Getting the students involved in the process, George invited a few of them to try and assemble the cart themselves, and everyone was then invited to take part in a crafts activity building their very own handheld mini carts, providing an opportunity for the kids to take home a keepsake after having their eyes opened to the ways of life for some in our country. Two days later on Saturday, September 30, the Bounty Theatre hall was once again the location for a special event, this one being a blanket exercise hosted by Sharon Meyer. A member of the Cree Nation, Beardys Okemasis First Nation, Meyer is a guest speaker and a Medicine Wheel knowledge keeper who recently retired from her position of First Nation and Mtis consultant for the North East School Division, where she helped incorporate Indigenous ways of learning into the classroom. Sharon Meyers presentation started with a ceremonial smudge. Photo Derek RuttleThe Outlook Beginning the day with a ceremonial smudge, Meyer walked around to each person sitting in the circle, who wafted the smoke towards them. Going over some historical facts, she spoke of medicine and how its not just the items bought in a health store that can be called as such. Your words are medicine, said Sharon. Your racism can bring someone down, and your positivity can bring someone up. A series of video clips aided Meyers presentation throughout the morning, including music videos and one clip signifying how no Indigenous person can just get over it in Canada, pointing to the countrys dark past when it comes to First Nations relations. The biggest portion of the mornings events then took place in the form of a blanket exercise. The blanket exercise is an interactive way to teach and learn 500 years of CanadianIndigenous history. Blankets are placed on the floor and participants stand on them, taking on the roles of First Nations people arriving to Canada, or Turtle Island as it was known in many circles, while others may portray European colonizers, who come in and begin to systematically remove personal items, rights and the identities that strip away at the heart of the Indigenous people. The exercise is narrated, beginning the story hundreds of years ago and bringing it all the way up to modern times, showing the shrinking and depletion of the things that make First Nations people who they were back then and who they are today. The exercise, in which more than a dozen people in Outlook took part in that day, was an emotionallydraining one for the participants. Watching the blankets get removed by settlers and seeing the group of people become more cramped signified the reductions of their First Nations identities in Canada as the years wore on. Whether it was completely eyeopening for some and a harsh reminder for others, there were plenty of tears shed following the exercise, in which a sharing circle was held where everyone was given an opportunity to share what they learned from the days events. Meyers talk with those present opened many eyes to the realities faced by Indigenous populations. Photo Derek RuttleThe Outlook Some harsh truths and some eyeopening revelations came out of that circle, and the one consistent thing that was noticed was how hopeful everyone was for a better and more understanding future. The one thing I always hear, the word hope comes out, said Sharon, adding that its what she routinely hears from other participants in the exercise.

The question has already come up in the United States and the United Kingdom, where national flood insurance programs exist. Canada does not have a national flood program, although the federal government pledged to build one in its 2023 budget. And if I look at Flood Re the national flood insurance program in the U.K., one of the reasons they did Flood Re was not because flood coverage wasnt available. If you had a flood in a highrisk flood zone, they would not allow reconstruction, Wolfe said.","When Canadian homeowners finally get access to Canadas proposed national flood insurance program, PC insurance industry professionals are curious how it will will affect the countrys real estate and mortgage industries. The question has already come up in the United States and the United Kingdom, where national flood insurance programs exist. Canada does not have a national flood program, although the federal government pledged to build one in its 2023 budget. As part of the Canadian program, consumers will have online access to flood plain information that allows them to assess the risk of their home getting flooded. The federal government says the program should be announced publicly in Spring 2024, and Insurance Bureau of Canada IBC is calling for the government to launch the program in April 2025. IBC notes 10 or roughly 1.5 million Canadian households are built in highrisk flood areas. And about 90 of insurers flood liability is associated with this 10 of households. Fully onethird of the financial liability for flood resides in the riskiest 1 of households, IBC chief economist and vice president of policy development Jordan Brennan, said at a panel discussing flood insurance at the National Insurance Conference of Canada NICC in Montreal. So thats the situation we find ourselves in now. Thats the intolerable present. Canadian PC insurers are currently working with the federal government on a privatepublic partnership model to make flood insurance available to people living in these highrisk areas. In this model, theoretically, the private insurance industry will pay out for a certain portion of flood catastrophes, and a federal government backstop will cover flood damage above and beyond that threshold. One question open for discussion within Canadas PC industry is What happens if the value of a policyholders home is reduced because its found to be in a highrisk area for flooding If we say to a homeowner, youre actually in a high risk flood zone, what does that do to the value of their home If theyre going to have to resell itthere could be a small portion of our population, it could be one of us, who are sitting in a place where the value of our home is going to be not as good as it was before, said NICC panellist Susan Penwarden, managing director of personal lines at Aviva Canada. And if I look at Flood Re the national flood insurance program in the U.K., one of the reasons they did Flood Re was not because flood coverage wasnt available. It was because of the costs being so high. They really worried that if they suddenly moved to market cost for flood insurance, the mortgage market would crash, and the housing market would crash. And if anybody whos lived in the UK, as I have, knows, the housing market is big part of the economy over there. They were quite worriedit would be a precipitous drop. In talking to one of my colleagues whos involved with it, he said, Look, it was never about availability. It was about affordability, and then gradually moving that affordability to the right level. Part of the U.K. Flood Re model addresses the sensitive topic of strategic retreat. In other words, relocating people and developers out of floodprone areas. Matt Wolfe, president and CEO of Aon Reinsurance Solutions Canada, noted how the Flood Re model incorporates an element of strategic retreat into its model. If you had a flood in a highrisk flood zone, they would not allow reconstruction, Wolfe said. In addition, if it was in a designated highrisk flood zone, they wouldnt insure new construction. Thats a smart, gradual approach, where youre saying, Okay, postevent youll collect flood insurance. But were not going to rebuild there. Builders, developers, youre not going to be able to rebuild there and offload this risk to Flood Re. I think theres a great lesson for us as we move forward. One argument for creating a flood insurance program in Canada is that the lack of availability of flood insurance could actually make things worse for PC insurers. In the U.S., noted NICC panellist Jolee Crosby, incoming president and CEO of Swiss Re Canada English Caribbean, people are automatically given the basic flood coverage and must opt out of it. That way, they have to make a conscious decision not to be insured for flood. Thats a lesson we learned from the U.S., where its driven so much from the mortgage industry, said Crosbee. Those properties that dont have flood insurance, they dont have a mortgage on their property, so they choose not to get flood insurance. These are lowerincome properties that have been generational homes. After Hurricane Fiona came in and decimated a whole area of Florida, there was no flood insurance. And so people lost their homes. And then what happened You had opportunistic developers coming in and offering prices, offering to buy the property, and it creates this vicious circle. Because then people dont have a place to go for new housing. You can you build more expensive properties in place of other properties, and then it just creates more of a difficult situation. So I like the thought of going in that direction of people automatically getting opted into the national flood insurance program. Feature image courtesy of iStock.comdrewhadley",1

CLAIM A video shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un saying in a speech that he blames President Joe Biden for the latest IsraelHamas war. CLAIM The Israeli military confirmed it bombed a hospital in Gaza in a social media post written in Arabic. CLAIM A video shows a BBC News report confirming Ukraine provided weapons to Hamas. The video shows footage from the making of the 2022 short film directed by Awni Eshtaiwe, a filmmaker based in the West Bank.","In the days since Hamas militants stormed into Israel early Oct. 7, a flood of videos and photos purporting to show the conflict have filled social media, making it difficult for onlookers from around the world to sort fact from fiction. While plenty of real imagery and accounts of the ensuing carnage have emerged, they have been intermingled with users pushing false claims and misrepresenting videos from other events. Among the fabrications, users have shared false claims that a top Israeli commander had been kidnapped, circulated a false video imitating a BBC News report, and pushed old and unrelated clips of Russian President Vladimir Putin with inaccurate English captions. Here is a closer look at the misinformation spreading online and the facts. CLAIM Videos taken one day apart show a Palestinian crisis actor pretending to be seriously injured in a hospital bed one day and completely fine the next. THE FACTS Two different people appear in the videos. In addition, the video of the injured man in a hospital bed dates to August. The videos are being shared to falsely claim an injured man is an actor playing a Palestinian victim. A post on X, formerly known as Twitter, puts two videos side by side. In one, a man lies seriously injured in a hospital bed with two other men at his side. In the other, a man is talking into a camera while walking through wreckage after an attack in Gaza. The post claims the videos show the same man, with the one in the hospital taken a day earlier. Palestinian blogger miraculously healed in one day from Israeli bombing. Yesterday, he was hospitalized, today, he is walking and walking like nothing happened, reads the post on X, with more than 9,000 likes. But the videos show two different people and the hospital video predates the latest IsraelHamas war. The video of the man speaking to the camera is Saleh Aljafarawi, from Gaza. Aljafarawi posted the original video on Oct. 25 to his Instagram account. More than 30 missiles landed in front of my eyes, he wrote in the caption with the video. Aljafarawi didnt respond to the APs request for comment. Aljafarawi also has a YouTube channel where he describes himself a Palestinian living in Gaza. The video of the young man in the hospital bed had been online at least August with the earliest version available posted on Aug. 18, 2023, on TikTok. Another video from a different angle was shared a day earlier on TikTok. One of the hashtags from the Aug. 18 video reads, NourShamsCamp, which is a refugee camp located in the West Bank. An Aug. 25 report from the International Solidarity Movement, a Palestinianled group, shows a photo of the same man in the hospital video. The report identifies him as 16yearold Mohammed Zendiq, whose leg was amputated at the hospital after he was injured during July 24 clashes at the camp. Other outlets reported on the events at the time. Associated Press writer Karena Phan in Los Angeles contributed this report. CLAIM A video shows a large number of U.S. Marines arriving at an airport in Israel amid the latest IsraelHamas war. THE FACTS The video is from 2022 and shows soldiers from the U.S. Armys 101st Airborne Division arriving in Romania. The footage shows soldiers dressed in fatigues getting off of a plane at night, carrying their belongings and walking across the tarmac. One post with the video on X, formerly known as Twitter, had more than 9,000 likes with text that reads HAPPENING NOW Thousands of U.S. Marines Just Landed in Israel WW3 HIGH ALERT However the video doesnt show Marines nor Israel, and it isnt recent. The original can be found on the Defense Departments media distribution website, which says it shows U.S. Army soldiers arriving in Romania in June last year. 101st Airborne Division Air Assault Soldiers arrive in Mihail Kogainiceani, Romania, June 28, 2022, reads the videos description. The site says the unit was there to reinforce NATOs eastern flank and conduct multinational exercises with allies across Europe. Hours after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, the U.S. did begin moving warships and aircrafts to the region. In an interview on 60 Minutes that aired Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris said the U.S. has no intention to send combat troops into Israel or Gaza. Karena Phan. CLAIM A major mosque in Iran raised a black flag to call Muslims to war over Israels attacks on Gaza. THE FACTS The Imam Reza shrine said the flag was raised as a symbol of mourning for the lives lost in Israels strikes on Gaza. Experts on Islam and Iran confirmed the flag includes a passage from the Quran that is meant to comfort Muslims that their sacrifices will one day be rewarded. Social media users are sharing the false claim alongside images and videos of the distinctive gold dome of the shrine a major pilgrimage site for Shiite Muslims in Irans northeast that includes a mosque, library and other institutions with a black banner flying on a flagpole. BREAKING The Black Flag has been raised over Razavi Shrine in Mashhad, Khorasan province, Iran, wrote one Facebook user who shared the image on Oct. 18, using an alternate name for the complex. This is a call for war or vengeance. Others claimed the black flag and its Farsi inscription was meant to herald the coming of the Mahdi, the final leader believed to appear at the end of times to lead Muslim people. But the black flag isnt a call for war, and neither the flags text nor the shrines statement about the banner references the coming of the Mahdi or the end of time. In fact, an announcement on the shrines Englishlanguage Facebook page on Oct. 17 specifically describes it as a mourning flag that was raised in response to the deadly blast that rocked a hospital in Hamascontrolled Gaza that day. In an unprecedented gesture and by the order of the custodian of Astan Quds Razavi, the black flag has been hoisted above the illuminated and pure Razavi dome, and drum beating will not be played tomorrow, the post said, including sorrow mourning sadness grief and other hashtags. Islamic and Iranian experts confirmed the flag includes a line from the Quran roughly translated as help from Allah and an imminent victory or conquest from Allah and victory is near. That phrase isnt traditionally used to declare war, but meant to bring comfort and hope to those struggling or engaged in battle that their sacrifice is not in vain and that Allah will grant them victory eventually, they said. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian Studies at Columbia University in New York, said the Quranic verse, in the context of the shrines Facebook post, means solidarity with the Palestinian cause and not an outright declaration of war against Israel. To me it says nothing more than the obvious the ruling government in Iran supports Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, he wrote in an email. Nothing more, nothing less. The Middle East Media Research Institute, a Washingtonbased think tank founded by Israeli analysts, agreed, noting that Islamic militants tend to use a different passage from the Quran when declaring war. The organization noted that statements from the Iranbacked Iraqi militias claiming responsibility for recent attacks on U.S. bases in Syria and Iraq open with this Quranic verse Permission to fight is given to those upon whom war is made because they are oppressed, and most surely Allah is well able to grant them victory. Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo in New York contributed this report. CLAIM A video shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un saying in a speech that he blames President Joe Biden for the latest IsraelHamas war. THE FACTS The video is from 2020 and the version currently circulating online features incorrect English captions. The footage actually shows Kim celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean Workers Party he doesnt reference the conflict in the Middle East or Biden at any point. In the misleading video circulating online, the English captions claim Kim says Under the Biden administration, conflicts erupt yearly. This year a war begins between Israel and Palestine. Im afraid that if the Biden admin does not cease to exist in the next election, World War 3 may begin, the captions continue. Who knows what next years war will be. I support Donald Trump for President in 2024. Good Luck to Mr. Trump. The video was shared on Instagram and TikTok, where one post garnered more than 223,000 likes. However, the video is old and the captions are completely inaccurate. Clips and images from the same speech can be seen in news reports from October 2020 about an event celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Korean Workers Party. A transcript of the full speech translated to English by The National Committee on North Korea, a U.S.based organization, does not mention anything about the IsraelHamas war nor the 2024 U.S. presidential race. Multiple Korean speakers and an expert who reviewed the portion of the speech circulating online also confirmed Kim says nothing of the sort in the footage. Instead, Kim thanks his people and his military, saying The patriotic and heroic commitment shown by our Peoples Army soldiers on the unexpected frontlines of epidemic prevention and natural disaster recovery this year is something that evokes tears of gratitude from everyone. JiYoung Lee, a professor of Korean Studies at American University who confirmed the captions are inaccurate, noted that the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas militants did create concerns in South Korea about a similar assault from the North. Karena Phan. CLAIM The Israeli military confirmed it bombed a hospital in Gaza in a social media post written in Arabic. THE FACTS A screenshot circulating online shows a Facebook post from an account posing as the Israeli military. No such post exists on the militarys actual social media pages and its top Arabicspeaking spokesperson confirmed his office has issued no such statement. In the wake of the Oct. 17 deadly blast at alAhli hospital in Gaza, social media users shared the screenshot, claiming it is from a member of the Israeli militarys Arabicspeaking media relations team. The users profile image bears the blueandwhite emblem of the spokespersons office, which features radio waves atop the Israeli militarys traditional symbol of an olive branchwrapped sword. The post, written in Arabic, suggests the Jewish nation said it bombed the hospital because the Gaza City medical facility lacked supplies and staff. Israeli official facebook post Due to the lack of medical equipment and the lack of medical staff, it was decided to bomb the Baptist Hospital in Gaza and give them euthanasia, wrote one user on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, in a post translating the screenshot. Similar posts were also widely shared on TikTok and other social media platforms. But the purported statement wasnt penned by the Israeli militarys press office, its top Arabicspeaking spokesperson confirmed this week. Just to clarify I did not issue any statement or comment regarding the Baptist Hospital in Gaza, wrote Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab media branch of the Israeli militarys Spokespersons Unit, in a post on X from Oct. 17, when the blast occurred. All the news circulating in my name comes from the Hamas media outlets and is completely false. The office on Oct. 19 confirmed the post did not come from the militarys official Arabic page, saying in an emailed statement The IDF has made it very clear that there was no IDF strike on the hospital. Whats more, the Israeli militarys press office doesnt use its own logo on its actual social media accounts, unlike the fake account. The units separate Facebook pages in English and Hebrew, as well as its X account written in Farsi, for example, all use the militarys main symbol. That goldcolored emblem features the olive branchwrapped sword with the Star of David in the background. Meanwhile Adraees social media accounts, which are the main channel for the Israeli militarys messages in Arabic, feature his profile picture and a maroonlogo consisting of five swords with flames in the background as its cover photo. The original fake account and post on Facebook also appear to have been deleted as of Oct. 19. Spokespersons for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, didnt reply to an email seeking comment. There were conflicting accusations of who was responsible for the hospital blast, with Hamas officials in Gaza blaming an Israeli airstrike and Israel saying it was caused by a an errant rocket launched by Palestinian militants. U.S. and French intelligence services also concluded it was likely caused by a misfired rocket. An AP analysis of video, photos and satellite imagery, as well as consultation with experts, showed the cause was likely a rocket launched from Palestinian territory that misfired in the air and crashed to the ground. However, a definitive conclusion could not be reached. Philip Marcelo. CLAIM A video shows Qatars emir threatening to cut off the worlds natural gas supply if Israel doesnt stop bombing Gaza. THE FACTS Qatars ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, says no such thing in the widely circulating clip, which is more than 6 years old. A spokesperson for the Qatari government also confirmed that neither the emir nor any other government official has threatened to cut off exports in response to the conflict. Many online are sharing the video of the Persian Gulf nations ruler, falsely claiming it shows him saying in Arabic that hes willing to halt the distribution of its gas reserves to achieve his desired end to the latest IsraelHamas war. BREAKING Qatar is threatening to create a global gas shortage in support of Palestine, wrote one user who posted the video on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. If the bombing of Gaza doesnt stop, we will stop gas supply of the world. But Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani says nothing of the sort in the video. The 7second clip is actually a tiny snippet from his opening speech at the Doha Forum in 2017. Marc Owen Jones, a professor of Middle East studies at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Doha, the capital of Qatar, confirmed that the emir touches briefly on Palestinians in the widely shared clip, but doesnt make any threats related to the current conflict. Instead the emir, in his remarks, urged the international community to take more steps to address the regions refugee crisis, news outlets reported at the time. The exact translation is The issue of Palestine, Ill begin by saying its a case of a people uprooted from their lands, and displaced from their nation, Jones wrote in an email. Qatars government on Oct. 16 confirmed the clip dates to 2017 and is being misrepresented. This is yet another case of an online disinformation against Qatar such a statement has never been made and never would be, wrote the countrys International Media Office in an email. Qatar does not politicize its LNG supplies or any economic investment. Qatar is one of the worlds top natural gas producers. It controlled the thirdlargest natural gas reserves and was the second largest exporter of liquified natural gas, or LNG, in 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Whats more, the country has been working in recent years to use its sizable resources to build ties with other nations, not antagonize them, according to experts. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a Bostonbased company that tracks gas prices nationwide, pointed to a deal Qatars state energy company just announced to supply French energy company TotalEnergies with 3.5 million tons of natural gas annually for the next 27 years. Qatar has been securing investment since Russias invasion of Ukraine pushed Europe to find new sources of natural gas and quickly, he wrote in an email. Theyre making deals left and right. Philip Marcelo. CLAIM A video shows a BBC News report confirming Ukraine provided weapons to Hamas. THE FACTS The widely shared video clip is fabricated, officials with the BBC and Bellingcat, an investigative news website that is cited in the video as the source, confirm. The clip, which includes the BBCs distinctive blocktext logo, purports to show a story from the outlet about a recent report from Bellingcat on Ukraine providing arms to Hamas. Bellingcat Ukrainian military offensive failure and HAMAS attack linked, reads the text over the video, which has more than 2,500 comments and 110,000 views on the messaging service Telegram. The Palestinians purchased firearms, ammunition, drones and other weapons. But neither the BBC nor Bellingcat has reported any evidence to support the notion that Ukraine funneled arms to Hamas. Weve reached no such conclusions or made any such claims, Bellingcat wrote Oct. 10 in a post on X that included screengrabs of the fake report. Wed like to stress that this is a fabrication and should be treated accordingly. Eliot Higgins, the Amsterdambased organizations founder, noted in a separate post on X that the claims have been amplified by Russian social media users. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a New York University professor briefly shown near the end of the video, also disputed the clips suggestion that hes said the U.S. might leave NATO if the arms claims prove true. Entirely fake. Never said that, the distinguished professor of risk engineering wrote in an email. Spokespersons for the BBC didnt respond to emails seeking comment, but Shayan Sardarizadeh, a reporter with the organizations fact checking unit, confirmed in a post on X that the video is not real. Ukrainian officials have similarly dismissed the notion that its countrys arms have somehow found their way to Hamas. The countrys military intelligence agency, in an Oct. 9 post on its official Facebook page, accused Russia of plotting a disinformation campaign around these claims. Experts say there is also no evidence of Hamas making any claims about receiving arms from Ukraine, nor would it make sense for Kyiv to provide them. I see no reason Ukraine would do this, said Michael OHanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Starting with the fact that Kiev is in the business of obtaining weapons and not giving them away. Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo in New York and Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed this report. CLAIM Video of a young actor being filmed lying in a pool of fake blood shows propaganda being created for use in the IsraelHamas war. THE FACTS The video is behindthescenes footage from the making of Empty Place, a short film focused on the story of Ahmad Manasra, a Palestinian who was arrested at age 13 in 2015 in relation to the stabbing of two Israelis. Social media users on both sides of the latest IsraelHamas war are sharing the video, each falsely alleging that its proof the other group is creating propaganda about their own. In the clip, a young actor lies on a sidewalk covered in fake blood, his right leg bent backward, as a film crew works around him. Other actors mill about dressed as soldiers and in garb worn by many Orthodox Jewish men. See how Israelis are making fake videos saying that Palestine Freedom Fighters killed children, reads one tweet that had received more than 5,600 likes and more than 4,400 shares as of Oct. 11. An Instagram post claimed the opposite, stating These terrorists are dressing up as JEWISH soldiers to create fake videos about Israeli soldiers Faking Propaganda But neither allegation is correct. The video shows footage from the making of the 2022 short film directed by Awni Eshtaiwe, a filmmaker based in the West Bank. The scene being shot begins about 1 minute and 10 seconds into the approximately 2 minute film. Mohamad Awawdeh, a cinematographer listed in the films credits as a camera assistant, posted the behindthescenes footage to TikTok in April 2022, around the time the film was released. A caption on the post, written in Arabic, explains that the scene being filmed in the video shows Manasra being attacked. Awawdeh posted the same footage to Instagram on June 30. Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin in New York contributed this report. CLAIM Nimrod Aloni, a top general in the Israeli army, was captured by Hamas militants during a deadly incursion Oct. 7 into southern Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip. THE FACTS Theres no truth to this claim, a spokesperson for the Israeli military confirmed. Aloni was seen Oct. 8 at a meeting of top Israeli military officials. The erroneous claim that Aloni was one of the hostages taken by Hamas spread widely online after the militant group attacked Israel. Palestinian resistance fighters capture Israeli commander Nimrod Aloni along with dozens of other Israeli soldiers as the resistance fighters attacked neighbouring occupied towns and Israeli check posts near Gaza, stated one Instagram post that received more than 43,000 likes. But Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli militarys chief military spokesman, told reporters Oct. 7 that claims Aloni was captured are not true. Aloni clearly appears 10 seconds into a video posted to the Israeli militarys official YouTube channel of top officials discussing the war on Oct. 8. The date can be seen on a slide in the background. The military also published online four images from the meeting. The one on the lower right shows Aloni on the far right. The Israeli army confirmed to The Associated Press that Aloni is the man in the video and image. Melissa Goldin. CLAIM A video shows Hamas fighters parachuting onto a sports field before attacking Israeli citizens during the groups surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel. THE FACTS While Hamas did employ paragliders to get some fighters across the border between Gaza and southern Israel, the footage of the sports field shows parachute jumpers in Cairo and has been online since at least September. The clip shows people strapped to multicolored parachutes descending onto a crowded sports field complex filled with children and families, many in red sports jerseys. Hamas paraglided amongst Israeli citizens and proceeded to massacre them, text on the video clip reads. One post of the misleading footage on TikTok was viewed more than 38,000 times. But this footage has been online since at least Sept. 27, when it was posted to TikTok with the location tag Egypt. Details of the video also point to Egypt as the location a person is wearing a blue shirt that reads El Nasr SC on the back, the name of a sporting club in northeastern Cairo. Images of the club on Google Maps match the scene of the video as well as several other clips of the event from the same TikTok user with both showing a bright blue fence around a sporting ground next to a paved area with green and blue plastic seats. The parachuters land on a larger soccer pitch surrounded by tall field lights. The field matches photos posted to the clubs Facebook page and footage of its soccer teams matches, including a distinctive red building with a blue fence on top at one end that can be seen in the TikTok clip at around 19 seconds. Other TikTok users shared footage of a parachuting similar scene around the same time, with El Nasr in the caption in Arabic. The crowd of onlookers in the clip circulating online also doesnt seem distressed by the arrival of the parachuters, as one might expect if they were an invading force. In fact, many women and children are seen running towards them, phones in hand taking videos and photos of the aerial display. CLAIM Two videos show Russian President Vladimir Putin warning the U.S. to stay away from the latest IsraelHamas war. THE FACTS Bothvideos circulating online are monthsold clips of Putin speaking about the RussiaUkraine war, not the conflict in the Middle East, which have been miscaptioned in English. Both videos show Putin speaking in Russian, with false English captions saying he was warning the U.S. to refrain from helping the Jewish state. America wants to Destroy israel as we destroy ukraine In past, the captions on one video state. I am warning America. Russia will help palestine and america can do nothing. One TikTok post that shared the clip had received approximately 11,600 views as of Oct. 9. A caption on another video of Putin, filmed in a different location, similarly reads I am warning america to stay Away from palestine israel war. But the two clips long predate the latest IsraelHamas war and make no mention of Israel at all. The first shows Putin at a meeting of Russias Human Rights Council in December 2022, where, amid discussions about the war in Ukraine, he responded to a question about the countrys potential use of nuclear weapons, as the AP reported at the time. The footage was featured by multiple other newsoutlets with similar translations. In the second, Putin is speaking at a February 2023 event marking the 80th anniversary of the World War II Soviet victory over Nazi German forces in the battle of Stalingrad. In his remarks, he compared this threat to Germanys thenrecent decision to supply Ukraine with tanks, the AP reported at the time. Several media outlets also featured the footage in similar reports. In reality, Putin has condemned the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on towns in southern Israel while also warning Israel against blockading the Gaza Strip. He has cast the war as a failure of U.S. peacemaking efforts, accusing Washington of opting for economic handouts to the Palestinians while abandoning efforts to help create a Palestinian state.

To fulfil that recommendation, MNRF will be leading the flood strategy commitment to establish a provincial urban flooding work group, Rolf von den BaumenClark told the committee. NDP climate critic Peter Tabuns asked when the working group would be convened and when it would start writing reports. I dont know what the Urban Flooding Working Group is Are we developing an Urban Flooding Policy","After a yearslong backandforth, the provincial government has now convened an urban flooding working group EDITORS NOTE A version of this article originally appeared on The Trillium, a new Village Media website devoted to covering provincial politics at Queens Park. In April, Ontario promised to create a working group on flooding. In June, the responsible ministers office appeared to have never heard of it. But yes as of October, it does exist, the ministry now confirms. Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry MNRF thendeputy minister Monique Rolf von den BaumenClark made the pledge on April 3, saying her ministry would take the lead on an intragovernmental working group to address urban flooding. The group was to be a response to the auditor generals 2022 report, which found a lack of leadership on the file. In a legislative committee discussing the AG report, Rolf von den BaumenClark said the group would be made up of the Ministries of Natural Resources and Forestry, Environment, Conservation and Parks, Municipal Affairs and Housing, Infrastructure and Transportation, and some municipalities. It would identify roles and responsibilities related to urban flooding, determine new or emerging urban flooding issues and develop a provincial framework for urban flooding policy, she said. To fulfil that recommendation, MNRF will be leading the flood strategy commitment to establish a provincial urban flooding work group, Rolf von den BaumenClark told the committee. NDP climate critic Peter Tabuns asked when the working group would be convened and when it would start writing reports. Rolf von den BaumenClark initially refused to offer a timeline but said, We will start this year, after Tabuns pressed her. Just two months later, the ministers top policy staffer appeared not to have heard of the project. According to internal emails received through a freedomofinformation request, a ministry staffer contacted several employees in Natural Resources and Forestry Minister Graydon Smiths office on June 1. She was looking for approval to get back to the legislative committee with a more specific timeline. Proposed Answer The provincial urban flooding working group will be established this summer, with deliberations to be held through this fall and winter and a final frameworkreport to be completed in the spring of 2024, the ministry staffer wrote. A response came the next morning from Smiths director of policy, Matthew Stubbings. I dont know what the Urban Flooding Working Group is he wrote. Are we developing an Urban Flooding Policy Please advice. sic A couple of hours later, Stubbings asked the ministry to tone down its proposed committee answer because Smith and his staff didnt know enough about the group. I dont think we offer any time commitments without the ministers office and minister being briefed on this groups terms of reference and broader policy objectives, he wrote. I propose we change the language to something like the... Ministry will be considering establishing a working group in the coming months... On Thursday, ministry spokesperson Richard Mullin said the group has been established and will indeed meet this fall. Ontarios 2020 flooding strategy pledged to establish a working group with provincial agencies to identify custodians for flood mapping information, including base data, with clear roles and responsibilities. In the auditor generals report, she notes that the ministry had drafted terms of reference and invitations to participate in the group back in 2020, following a report from a Special Advisor on Flooding that recommended its creation but it still hadnt been created as of 2022. The province is well aware of the need to do more to address this issue, thenauditor general Bonnie Lysyk wrote, noting that four reports and plans had made recommendations. Yet the province has never clarified provincial roles for addressing and coordinating actions needed to alleviate the risk of urban flooding, with the result that gaps in responsibility persist and actions and commitments have never been implemented. The government seemed to backtrack on its plan to create a flood group after Lysyks report. Four ministries told her theyd work within their own mandates on flooding, but none agreed to develop a provincial framework that clearly identifies and assigns roles and responsibilities for urban flood management, Lysyk wrote. Floodprone communities have called for more help from higher levels of government, singling out the siloed nature of support. Some say governments could learn something from the Americans, whose Army Corps of Engineers is creating a plan to protect the shorelines of eight states along the Great Lakes. Thenenvironment minister David Piccini promised in August to call on the feds to create a similar plan. He also said there would be an announcement from Ottawa on that front in the fall, but the feds said they werent sure what he was talking about.",1

Selon une nouvelle tude, des chercheurs affirment que ces catastrophes ont un impact croissant sur les revenus fiscaux des villes, qui sappuient largement sur les taxes foncires, empchant peu peu ces municipalits de payer les cots de ladaptation climatique. Selon ce que rappellent les chercheurs, originaires des Universits Cornell et dtat de la Floride, en septembre de lan dernier, louragan Ian a ravag le sudouest de la Floride, tuant au moins 156 personnes et entranant au moins 113 milliards de dollars amricains en dgts. Puis, louragan Idalia a frapp la rgion floridienne appele Panhandle, en septembre de cette anne, en plus dune superlune qui a aussi augment la force des inondations lies aux mares, dans le sudest de ltat. Les communauts peuvent sadapter certains de ces effets, ou au moins gagner du temps, crivent les spcialistes, en adoptant certaines politiques, comme le fait de moderniser les systmes de gestion des eaux de temptes, en plus de surlever les routes et les trottoirs. Mais les catastrophes climatiques et laugmentation du niveau de la mer nuisent aussi aux gouvernements, sur le plan fiscal, en faisant crotre les cots et en rduisant la base fiscale des villes. Pire encore, cette dpendance envers les taxes foncires pourrait dcourager les gouvernements locaux de cesser les dveloppements immobiliers dans les zones inondables, ce qui, affirmeton, est essentiel pour rduire les risques long terme. Dans le cadre de leur tude, les chercheurs ont constat que plus de la moiti des 410 villes de Floride seraient affectes par une hausse du niveau de la mer de lordre denviron deux mtres. Prs de 30 de tous les revenus locaux de ces 211 municipalits proviennent de btiments construits dans des zones qui seront trs largement inondes, potentiellement dici la fin du sicle. Malgr tout, affirmeton, les planificateurs urbains et les lus ignorent largement quel point la crise climatique affectera la sant fiscale lchelle municipale. Pire encore, indiquent les auteurs de ltude, certaines des communauts les plus risques sont parmi celles qui en font le moins pour se prparer. Le pige des taxes foncires Si les taxes foncires reprsentent 30 des revenus des villes, aux tatsUnis, en plus dtre le levier fiscal sur lequel les municipalits ont le plus de contrle, cest aussi une source dargent qui est directement menace par les catastrophes climatiques. Avec le rchauffement des ocans, les ouragans sont plus froces et se rendent plus loin lintrieur des terres ou le long des ctes. La crise climatique fait aussi augmenter le niveau des mers, ce qui fait augmenter les inondations ctires pendant les temptes et les mares hautes. Contrairement aux temptes, les hausses du niveau des ocans ne sinversent pas il sagit de la menace dune inondation permanente des terres ctires, avec le temps qui passe, mentionnent les auteurs des travaux. Sans compter les impacts physiques de la crise, la valeur foncire des proprits risque peut diminuer en raison dun dclassement des marchs immobiliers, ou encore dune hausse marque des frais dassurance, quand les compagnies ne refusent pas carrment dassurer ces proprits trop souvent menaces par les lments. Ce phnomne prend dailleurs dj de lampleur. Et dans ce cas, difficile, voire impossible de vendre son domicile pour stablir ailleurs qui voudrait acheter une maison qui pourrait tre emporte par locan dchan ou rendue inhabitable Et ces mmes impacts climatiques font monter la facture des services publics, comme leau courante, les gouts et lentretien des routes. Par exemple, liton dans ltude, la chaleur fait gondoler la chausse, les inondations emportent les infrastructures, et les trs fortes pluies poussent les rseaux dgout leur limite. Si les villes ne sadaptent pas, laccroissement des dgts provoqus par les catastrophes climatiques et laugmentation du niveau de la mer creront un cycle fiscal vicieux, en sapant la base fiscale et en faisant bondir le cot des services, ce qui, son tour, laissera encore moins dargent disponible pour ladaptation , crivent les chercheurs. Cependant, si les villes rduisent le dveloppement dans les zones risque, leurs taxes foncires et dautres revenus seront rduits. Et sils construisent davantage de murailles ctires et de maison blindes pour rsister aux ouragans et aux temptes, cela poussera plus de gens vivre dans des endroits dangereux, ajoutentils. Les revenus locaux risque Toujours selon les chercheurs, en vertu du scnario examin, des inondations pourraient toucher des proprits possdant une valeur combine de 619 milliards de dollars US, et qui gnrent des taxes foncires de lordre de 2,36 milliards par an. Cinq millions de Floridiens vivent dans des villes o au moins 10 des revenus locaux proviennent de zones risque lev dinondations chroniques et permanentes. Pire encore, pour 64 villes examines, 50 de leurs revenus proviennent de telles zones. Et de lavis des auteurs de ltude, les vritables effets fiscaux seraient probablement pires, aprs avoir tenu compte dautres revenus perdus, de la hausse des dpenses et des impacts de nombreux dangers climatiques, comme une temprature plus chaude et des ouragans plus intenses. Ces impacts ne sont dailleurs pas rpartis de faon quitable sur le territoire de cet tat du sud des tatsUnis. Les villes les plus risque, sur le plan fiscal, sont plus petites, plus denses, plus riches et plus blanches. linverse, les villes les moins risque sont plus peuples, plus diversifies, aux revenus plus faibles et au territoire plus vaste. La tte dans le sable De lavis des chercheurs, leurs conclusions sont un appel aux gouvernements locaux et tatique . Sans action urgente pour sadapter la crise climatique, des dizaines de municipalits pourraient se retrouver dans le rouge , affirmentils. Pourtant, plusieurs villes de Floride poursuivent des programmes de croissance via une expansion de leur infrastructure. Mme aprs des vnements dvastateurs comme louragan Iran, les limites administratives, les obligations en matire de services publics et les responsabilits budgtaires viennent compliquer la tche des leaders municipaux pour que ceuxci puissent faire une place pour leau, ou permettre aux citoyens de se relocaliser sur des terres surleves, liton dans ltude. Les scientifiques estiment que si la tendance favoriser la croissance et lexpansion se poursuit dans les villes ctires menaces, les rgions davantage situes lintrieur des terres, ainsi quen hauteur, comme St. Petersburg, Tampa et Miami, attireront davantage de dveloppements plus rsistants et de meilleure qualit, alors que les rsidents faibles revenus et membres des minorits ethniques devront soit quitter la rgion, ou vers les rgions ctires dont les ressources sont dj en dclin. Nous ne considrons pas ce rsultat comme tant invitable, en Floride comme ailleurs. Les villes ont des options pour grer leurs territoires afin de promouvoir des mthodes fiscalement justes, quitables et durables, afin de sadapter aux changements climatiques. La cl consiste reconnatre le pige fiscal et sy attaquer , affirment les spcialistes. Parmi les solutions, on suggre de diversifier les sources de revenus pour les villes, comme des taxes sur la consommation, sur les locaux inoccups, ou encore des frais associs aux impacts des temptes. Les petites villes sont aussi appeles faire cause commune et partager les revenus fiscaux, histoire de rduire les dveloppements dans les zones risque, tout en continuant dassurer les services pour leurs rsidents. Sloigner du modle de dveloppement traditionnel ne sera pas facile, mais notre tude dmontre que la Floride, avec son territoire plat et ses milliers de kilomtres de ctes, est menace par des impacts fiscaux en cascade si ltat poursuit sur sa voie actuelle , concluent les chercheurs.",1

In 1969, he graduated from the Krakow State Theater School, and made his stage debut with the role of Robert Faulconbridge in Drrenmatts play King John after Shakespeare, directed by Irina Babel.

As a film actor, he is primarily associated with the role of Bogusaw Radziwi the flood And coordinator Waldemar Mishorowski Th leper . It is to the director of these films, Jerzy Hoffmann, that Teleczynski owes his popularity. It was his films The Flood, in which I played the role of Bogusaw Radziwi, and, above all, The Leper, in which I played the orderly Waldemar Mishorowski that had a huge audience and gave me the greatest popular success, says the actor. When Jerzy Hoffmanns film The Leper was first shown in cinemas in 1976, all the Polish women went crazy for the handsome and organized man Waldemar Michorowski. Teleszyski then gained fame, notoriety and the admiration of women. However, the 30yearold actor was prepared for it beautiful women had lusted after him for years and did not hesitate to approach him on the street. Actor Henrik Talar recalled to his colleague We were walking in Krakow with Jurik Trella and Leszek and we heard women sighing Look, what a man. ideal. amazing. We had no doubt which of us aroused such feelings. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was one of the most beloved Polish actors among viewers. Even when he played villains, he was adorable and women fell madly in love with him He said I like to play villains. I try never to play with a thick black line, because it looks uninteresting to me. I always look for grey, anything in between, and try to give every character human characteristics. In one of the interviews In 1998, the actor began acting in this series Zlotopolsky In which he played Senator Jerzy Kowalski for 13 years. Unfortunately, when TVP decided to end production of the series, Teleszyski disappeared from the screens. We still see him in occasional appearances in Colors of Happiness, and he also appeared in small roles in two films Cursed and Na Uzim Ma Ive had a few breaks in my career, but apparently there hasnt always been a demand for an actor like me.

My friends from drama school were extras in Part Three of the Night , and uawski invited me to test pictures for the main role. I knew then that if I got this role, I would face a huge challenge. I wasnt wrong, the actor said years later. The Third Part of the Night takes place in Lviv during World War II, and in order to survive the German occupation, Teleszyskis hero gets a job as a lice feeder at the Weigl Institute. My hero was supposed to feed the lice, so he thought I should know what its like. I went to the institute in Gdynia. I had several thousand lice on my legs I was sitting and they were feeding on me said the actor in an interview with Rzeczpospolita . The neophyte was very afraid that he might contract typhus. Although he confirmed that all the lice were intact, he was given a vaccine to be on the safe side. He says I would rather get sick Giving the vaccine in the form of an oily liquid can only be compared to being beaten with an iron rod. 17 On Wednesday, January 4, 2017, it was exactly 45 years since the premiere of one of the most original performances in the history of Polish cinema The Third Part of the Night by Andrzej Sawski. The main roles in the film based on the war experiences of the directors father writer and diplomat Miroslaw uawski were played by Magorzata Braunek and Leszek Teleszyski. Source East NewsBulfilm A year after finishing filming The Third Part of the Night, Andrzej uawski began filming The Devil. The directors wife and she was then Malgorzata Brunek She insisted on involving Teleszyski. She didnt want to play with anyone else And only for this reason Leszek agreed to appear in the film The Devil and he quickly regretted it. This time, uawski sent the actor to a psychiatric hospital. I went to a psychiatric hospital in Torquay and locked myself in a schizophrenic room with no doorknobs, recalls Leszek Tiliczynski, who adds that Andrzej Zulawski had no mercy on anyone, not even his wife. Magosia Bronek had a nervous attack during the shooting. He wanted to get more and more emotions out of her, but it was not enough, he said. The film was so powerful that censorship did not allow it to be shown in cinemas. After the screening, a censor concluded that Polish viewers were not prepared to witness such experiments. The Devil has been on the shelf for 16 years During his studies, Leszek Teleszyski became involved with his college girlfriend Alicja Jachiewicz, i.e. Teresa Krasawska from The Poaniecki Family. They were the most beautiful couple in Krakow, and when they announced in the late 1960s that they were getting married, the whole city was waiting for their wedding. However, instead of leading his beloved to the altar, Leszek left her without a word of explanation picture Alicia Gaczewicz and Leszek Tyliczynski TZ East News East News East News Shortly thereafter, at the Polish theater he met Irina Szczurowska, an actress six years his senior, known primarily for her stage and television performances. He fell in love with her and she quickly returned his feelings. Soon after being cast by a Polish theater director as lovers in a play, they also became lovers in their private lives. Unfortunately, the actor and his beautiful lover could not flaunt their love because Irina was married. For several months, they hid that they had something more than just friendship, but finally the actresss husband discovered that his wife was flirting with him. Irina Szczorowskas marriage ended in a social scandal, because the man she cheated on was a widely known and respected writer, and one of the founders of the Student Satirical Theater, Jaroslaw Abramov Nyorli. At first, the writer decided to fight for his wife, but after a year of fierce fighting, he gave up and stopped standing in the way of the actors happiness. Teleszyski and Szczurowska married in 1976, and three years later, their daughter Karolina was born. Shortly after their child was born, the relationship they had fought so hard for began to deteriorate. The couple did not come to an agreement and had a quick divorce. It was rumored that the prose of life killed them. Leszek Tiliczynski only found true happiness in the early 1990s, and is still in a happy relationship with Jolanta, who became his second wife.",1

The event led to billions of dollars in damage to communities and highway infrastructure across the province. Stefan LabbGlacier Media The B.C. government is calling on the public to weigh in on how it should provide financial assistance in a disaster. The process, which is open to individuals, communities and small businesses, will inform a new postemergency financialassistance regulation and follows the Oct. 3, 2023, introduction of the Emergency and Disaster Management Act. The modernized act, which will be phased in starting late this year and will be reviewed every five years, requires infrastructure risk assessments and include the impact of climate change. The legislation is also guided by recognition of Indigenous rights and shifts emergency management from a focus on response to one that balances mitigation, preparation, response and recovery. Bowinn Ma, Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, said her ministry knows there remain gaps in the regulation and thats why they are calling on the public to help understand how they need assistance following an emergency. Following the 2021 atmosphericriver event, we received the highest number of applications in our Disaster Financial Assistance programs history, said Ma in a statement. I urge people to share their experiences so we can provide the most timely and effective assistance possible. Anyone interested in responding to the modernized emergency management act can do so by sending a written submission to modernizeEMgov.bc.ca by Dec. 31, 2023 or attend a virtual workshop. The public is also invited to respond to a series of questionnaires tailored to tenants, homeowners, farmers, small business owners, and Indigenous Peoples living on reserve lands, among others. B.C. emergency support outdated, finds ombudsman The call for public input comes less than two weeks after the provinces ombudsman released a report that found emergency support programs for disaster evacuees in British Columbia are outdated, underresourced, inaccessible and poorly communicated. The report analyzed the governments response to wildfires and severe flooding in 2021, finding there was unclear and confusing communication, unreasonable delays and a lack of flexibility about how help was delivered. Systems and processes that deliver assistance did not take into account the distinct needs of Indigenous evacuees, elderly people or those with physical and cognitive disabilities, said Ombudsperson Jay Chalke after the reports release. A onesizefitsall approach that weve seen in the past in terms of emergency support is shortsighted and doesnt do nearly enough to meet the needs of a diverse public that it is trying to serve, Chalke said. Meanwhile, Premier David Eby has appointed a 14member task force made up of emergency and wildfire management experts to provide recommendations on how to better prepare for emergencies before the 2024 wildfire season. Climate change making B.C. forests more flammable The 2023 wildfire season was the most destructive in B.C.s recorded history, with fires burning more than 2.8 million hectares. Thats more than double B.C.s previous record set in 2018. In B.C., the influence of climate change has been especially visible in recent years. The province has seen four of its most destructive wildfire seasons since 2017. Three of those saw more than a million hectares of forest burn across the province. By comparison, between 1919 and 2016, only three wildfires seasons burned more than half a million hectares, according to a recent study, which found climate change has made B.C. forests more flammable. Thats left researchers to conclude that B.C. will join a shortlist of global hot spots for wildfire over the coming decades. British Columbia is alongside California, Australia and the Mediterranean countries in southern Europe where catastrophic fire driven by climate change superimposed on decades of landuse practices has made our ecosystems more vulnerable, said Lori Daniels, a researcher in forestry at the University of British Columbia and one of the lead authors on the September study.

The project will include the installation of a bridge to replace the culvert under Highway 97 where it crosses Cache Creek near the Dairy Queen. The Highway 97 culvert is one of three chokepoints on the creek which have been identified as as having contributed to major flooding in the community, most recently in May 2023. The fourlane bridge, which will be approximately 13 metres long and built to a 75year lifespan, will see the creek daylighted at that spot. The channel will be deepened and widened to handle peak river flows and debris, especially during the spring freshet, and will be built to ensure structural stability against erosion. John Robineau, deputy director the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructures MOTI Cariboo Road Recovery Projects, is in charge of the project, along with 10 other major projects between Williams Lake and Quesnel in response to landslides in 2020 and 2021. He says that his project team was able to take on the project to support the recovery efforts in Cache Creek, and that they are looking to see work begin as early as this winter. The entire project is expected to take one construction season usually April through October, with a plan to complete the work in 2024. Weve done advance procurement for some components of the bridge, and preconstruction activities, such as utility relocation, are done in advance of work starting, he says. While thats underway traffic management like signs and cones will be in place. The southbound lanes will be built first, then the northbound lanes, so well build two lanes and move traffic to that, then build the other two lanes. During construction all business access will remain open, and pedestrian and bike access will still be maintained, so people can get to the school. Robineau notes that the bridge design will allow the highway to remain at the current elevation, so drivers wont face a hump. The new crossing will be wider and deeper to accommodate design flows, as well as debris coming down the channel. Were also looking to accommodate for floodwater volumes. Climate resiliency is a key focus with this project. He notes that there are several benefits to the ministry and the village working together on the Cache Creek corridor, and says that the Highway 97 crossing the most downstream of the three chokepoints on the creek is a good place to start work from a hydraulic perspective. If you start at the top Quartz Road you get a perfect new channel, but water hits the next chokepoint with more volume. Working up to the headwater establishes a new standard for all of them. Robineau adds that the project will also improve the environmental habitat within the creeks channel, and that the ministry and Bonaparte First Nation have worked together to prevent spawning in the channel for this season, to facilitate the new habitat being built. It goes a long way to start rebuilding Cache Creek as a fish habitat thats a safe place to be. He acknowledges that there is certainly more work to be done, however, a sentiment with which Cache Creek CAO Damian Couture agrees. Were starting a public consultation process, says Couture. We want to be thorough, but we know we have to be fast. Weve been working heavily with MOTI, and have been focused on assisting with their project, but now that theyre ready for tender we can shift focus back to the other two chokepoints. One of the two is at Quartz Road, where the creek has now been daylighted past the fire hall. Before this years flooding there were three lanes at Quartz Road and Highway 1 two vehicle lanes exiting onto the highway and one vehicle lane entering from it, with no dedicated pedestrian space. The road has been gone since May, and Couture says the village has been hearing a lot from the public about what needs to happen there. Its not a quick process, but were trying to get through it as quickly as we can. What people want there can be very different from person to person. We do hear We want a bridge, but there can be a lot of different bridges to span that space. The village has recently put out a survey available on their Facebook page and website residents can also contact the village office by phone, email, or inperson outlining the four options they are considering for Quartz Road 1 Put in a bigger culvert that is rated to handle the water flow, but keep the same lane configuration as in the past. This would probably be the least costly option for the village, as restoring the site to more or less its preevent condition would mean that 90 to 95 per cent of the project cost would be covered by Disaster Financial Assistance. 2 Create a bridge with three vehicle lanes two exiting Quartz Road and one entering it and pedestrian space. This would probably be the most costly option. 3 Create a bridge with only two lanes, one of which would be wide enough for vehicles but would be used for pedestrians except in case of emergency. We understand that theres a decent amount of contention about the amount of traffic at the fourway stop adjacent to the community hall, says Couture, so maybe it makes sense that Quartz Road leaving the residential area is out only to Highway. One of the two lanes could be pedestrian walking space, but could be used for traffic. 4 Leave the area more or less as it is now, with no road access to Highway 1 and a pedestrian bridge across Cache Creek at Quartz Road. Maybe we dont put anything back, get rid of the road, prettyup the space, and have a pedestrian bridge, says Couture. Three of the four proposed plans would have major traffic implications for the area, and Couture says that council has already directed staff to begin conversations with MOTI about changing the traffic light signalization at Highway 97 and Stage Road, regardless of what goes in at Quartz. I wish we had some mockup designs, but waiting for them would slow down the process, Couture adds. Thats why its so important to get input. We want to see what people want, get first and second choices, then do mockups or theoretical drawings of the top two, or maybe even just one if its a resounding winner. If one option is clearly ahead of the rest the recommendation to council would be just to look at that one. The culvert at the Cache Creek Motor Inn has been identified as probably the only other chokepoint on Cache Creek. There used to be multiple culverts throughout the community, but theyve slowly been removed, notes Couture. After weve spanned the other two it might be the only culvert left in the whole waterway within municipal limits. There has been some significant discussion going on about how to solve that issue. With all that water going through the space, can it handle that much volume, or will it be damaged asks Couture. Weve been talking with adjacent property owners and many ministries to sort out that issue, and the conversations with all the parties have been great so far. Everyone has a common goal that this is an issue that needs to be resolved. Couture adds that the village already has an eye on the 2024 freshet season. Were already having conversations with the Ministry of Emergency Management about what if we have the same issue next year with the same volumes and what do we need to do to mitigate something like this years event. That conversation is ongoing. Well see some substantial change, but its very challenging figuring out how to do so much before the next freshet. We have some strong allies and advocates who are working with us, and I think well see some positive things. Im hoping for the best.",1

Jeff McIntoshThe Canadian Press Load Image United Conservative Party members have proposed a resolution requiring parental notification whenever a student under 16 wants to change their name or pronouns at school. The resolution, which echoes legislation just introduced in the Saskatchewan legislature, is one of 30 policies up for discussion at the governing partys annual general meeting next month. The policy is proposed by the UCP constituency in EdmontonWest Henday. As was noted by Saskatchewan Education Minister Dustin Duncan, schools require a signed permission slip to take children on a field trip so its unclear why schools should not require parental consent for identification changes, the rationale for the resolution states. Schools should not be in the business of going behind parents backs. Kristopher Wells, an associate professor and the Canada Research Chair for the Public Understanding of Sexual and Gender Minority Youth at MacEwan University in Edmonton, said he is disappointed but not surprised the pronouns resolution is in the policy package. Wells said these kinds of measures are meanspirited, discriminatory and hurtful to vulnerable students who would benefit from having support at school. The research tells us quite clearly that gender affirmation reduces suicide ideation, Wells said in an interview with CBC News. These kinds of policies, when theyre enacted, cause very significant harm and realworld damage to young people. Premier Danielle Smith won the UCP leadership in 2022 with the backing of Take Back Alberta, an antivaccine, antilockdown activist group, whose leadership is opposed to transgender rights and believes parents need to fight back against a socalled woke ideology in the school system. On Friday, Smith suggested her government would have to talk to more than just UCP members before deciding to go ahead with a parental rights law. We also confer with stakeholders and we also talk to Albertans, Smith said at an unrelated news conference Friday. I want to see how the debate goes and then well make some decisions once we see whether or not it passes. Take Back Alberta At last years annual general meeting, a flood of TBA supporters helped get directors tied to the group elected to the partys provincial board. The group swept all nine seats, to control half the UCP board. This years annual general meeting set for Nov. 3 and 4 in Calgary was moved to a larger venue due to a surge of registrations. Other policies up for debate include proposals to end affirmative action for postsecondary admissions, close all Diversity, Inclusion and Equity offices at postsecondary institutions and prohibit the implementation of 15minute cities, a planning concept that encourages locating services within walking distance of peoples homes. Other resolutions reflect grievances from the COVID19 pandemic For example, two proposals aim to shield physicians from censure or job loss if they speak out against the use of COVID19 vaccines, or prescribe medications like Ivermectin to treat COVID19, even though it is not approved for that use in Canada. Melanee Thomas, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, said some of proposals are influenced by conspiracies about the COVID19 pandemic as well as the Republican politics in the United States. Thomas said data from 2018 showed there was a contingent of Alberta voters who were very socially conservative, pessimistic about the future and not politically active. Danielle Smith politically activated them, and their influence is now seen throughout the 2023 proposals, Thomas said. It looks like Take Back Alberta is very organized, she said. But Im not sure there are other elements within the party that might want to push back against some of these things that are as organized as Take Back Alberta is.",1

The latest incident yesterday was the worst in the 30 years that many of the more than 200 vendors who operate from the facility have experienced. This is their third major fire, coupled with a devastating flood that wreaked havoc in 2017 and breakins, which occur constantly. This is a pretty major blow to the smallbusiness community in Montego Bay, and this has happened just before Christmas, Deputy Prime Minister Dr Horace Chang told The Gleaner on Sunday, hours after visiting the vendors who have lost millions, of dollars in goods. According to Chang, the shortterm plan is to look at some businesscontinuity solution, and in the medium term, solutions aimed at fixing the facility, which is mainly board and zinc, through rehabilitation. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. As a result of the type of material in the market, the fire department warns that usually when there is a fire on the property, it spreads quickly, and on arrival there about 215 a.m., free burning was taking place. At least 60 per cent of the property was on fire. We used three pumpers until Trelawny arrived to assist us ... firefighting activities continued for about an hour before the fire was brought under control, Fire Superintendent Roland Walters said. Four hours later, the fire team was still spraying down the property with water. The fire load in this area is very heavy. Our initial investigation is showing that there are approximately 100 shops. All the shops are board, and the material is highly flammable, hence the extent of the damage, he noted. Rubbished accusations The fire department is currently investigating the cause of the fire. Walters rubbished accusations by the vendors that there was no water in the trucks that arrived from the Montego Bay Fire Station next door to the market. Three different groups, plus family, worked on containing the fire, said Walters. He admitted that water pressure is low in the area but indicated that that did not affect their efforts because they received assistance from the St James Municipal Corporation SJMC. The lands on which the market is located, between Creek Street and South Street, downtown Montego Bay, are owned by the SJMC. Deputy Mayor of Montego Bay Richard Vernon, who visited the facility Sunday morning, said he was awaiting the investigation of the fire department, however, he urged the people affected to go ahead and submit their reports to the team. As soon as the investigations are completed, the St James Municipal Corporation will meet with all the people who have been affected by the fire. So that we can devise the most appropriate approach to addressing the situation, he stated. In the meantime, 64yearold Imogene Salmon, who is fighting her third fire in the 30 years she has been operating in the market, is devastated. So is 65yearold Monica Bennett, who lost all her goods in 2015 when her shop was burnt to the ground and again returned to ashes on Sunday morning. My second fire and my store has been robbed three times. I am in court right now with one of the robbers who was held, and now fire tek mi, she lamented, hardly able to stand. It was a man who held me up when I got into the market. Right now mi weak. When I saw my shop, I felt like I want to go to the bathroom. Everything that me have burn up. All my investment, including bandana that I bought hoping to sell for Heroes Day, she told The Gleaner. Bennett said she left her shop at midnight Saturday, reached home by 1230 a.m., and by 130 a.m., she received a call that the market was on fire. Salmon said the last time she was flooded out in 2017, no one came to help them. Everything happen over yah, nobody nuh help we. Nutten. I dont save a pin, she cried. Last Wednesday, she purchased 40,000 worth of goods in the Falmouth Market, she said, because she wanted to catch the holiday. The only thing she sold out of that fresh batch was one blouse. Revealing that things had not been going so well in the market, she said she bought a deep freeze three months ago and started selling drinks. The deep freeze and several cases of drinks burnt beyond recognition. Many more shops would have been affected had it not been for a container that literally slowed the fire. A man who goes by the name Scott said this was his second fire, and he was at a loss for words. Overcome by the destruction, he said there was a great deal of uncertainty regarding his future. My shop has been broken into three times, and I saw ashes when I reached the market this morning. Right now mi nuh know wah me a go do. Christmas deh right round the corner. Bills have to pay, children to send to school. It is estimated that some 40 shops went up in flames. janet.silveragleanerjm.com",1

Fraser Valley Regional District Area E director Patti MacAhonic sent the B.C. government a letter, recommending the province find a financial solution for six homeowners who have not been able to move forward and recover. MacAhonic said the six homes have been either completely destroyed or have been deemed unsafe for return. The damages to their properties were not covered under private insurance, nor were they eligible for disaster financial assistance, she said. The homes are located in the Chilliwack River Valley Electoral Area E. The area the homes sit on has been assessed numerous times by engineers, with the conclusion that the six properties are not safe to occupy. Story continues below advertisement One of the engineering reports states, A large landslide in the Chilliwack River Valley is certain, and such a landslide would damage or destroy any structures and kill anyone inside. MacAhonic said she has been working closely with the residents affected, who have expressed that they have suffered immense trauma. The constant delays and lack of information, as well as long gaps in any communication from the province, has exacerbated this trauma and some are experiencing health and mental health concerns due to the further stress of this uncertainty, she said. The B.C. Ministry of Emergency and Climate Readiness said the residents were not eligible for disaster financial assistance since the risk of future landslides are not covered under the current policy. In early 2023, the Ministry of Emergency and Climate Readiness sent its engineering consultant to conduct further assessments of the six properties and make recommendations on whether mitigation works are possible. In May 2023, residents were informed of the results of these assessments that mitigation works are not feasible, MacAhonic said. The affected homeowners have been waiting since May for a provincial resolution, with some choosing to live in the unsafe properties as they have no other options. The assessed value of the six properties in 2021 was less than 5 million in total. The homeowners want fair market value for their homes. Story continues below advertisement One of those residents is Richard Holmes, who had been living at his home for more than 40 years. Prior to the event, it was a home that was valued at a million dollars. Now, my official B.C. assessment for my house and property is 2, he told Global News. We were fully insured but land movement disqualified an insurance claimThe landslide was caused by crown land above us, coming down and compressing our property and moving crown land beneath us. Our whole acre was destroyed and this is government property. This seems like a hit and run by the government. Another resident, Hans Baer, who has lived in his home for around 18 years, said the entire timeline of events has flipped his life upside down. I paid my taxes and I was a good citizen, he told Global News on Sunday. On November 15, everything has changed. My house is worth zero now. It was estimated to be worth 2.5 million. I put a tremendous amount of sweat into this house. I think this is when the government should come in and help people. My complete retirement is in question I have no place to go. MacAhonic spoke with Global News on Sunday These people are the salt of the earth they are hardworking taxpaying citizens with families, and this has been absolutely traumatic, she said. David Eby said there has been a precedent before where we have had other situations where people have been paid out the assessed values of their homes. Story continues below advertisement The Ministry of Emergency and Climate Readiness provided a statement through email. We recognize that this has been an extremely challenging situation for the impacted residents, a spokesperson said. The province is continuing to work with the Fraser Valley Regional District to explore all possibilities for the best ways to support residents.

Local geologist Brent Rouble said a million things would have to go right to break an unusual but challenging Guinness World Record paddling in a giant pumpkin for more than 62 kilometres. Having grown regularsized pumpkins for the past three years in his Boundary Road backyard, the passionate gardener decided to take it up a notch heading into last spring. I really wanted to grow a giant pumpkin, he told SooToday. I researched it like crazy. After I planted it, Id work on it pretty much every night from 710 between May and October. Rouble managed to grow a pumpkin just shy of 900 pounds smashing his previous record of 88 pounds. His accomplishment was recognized at the Algoma Farmers Markets annual Giant Pumpkin Weigh Off last month as he secured first place. Despite winning the competition, Rouble had bigger goals in mind. I saw this article that someone broke the world record for the furthest journey in a giant pumpkin boat, he explains. If could grow a pumpkin big enough that I could fit in and paddle, then I wanted to attempt that record. The shape looks like a boat kind of, and the top of it actually looks like a hull, he adds. Its really flat and wide at the bottom. After carving out the pumpkins insides and cutting a hole through the top, Rouble was joined by family, friends, and several dozen Saultites at the Bellevue Marina on Sunday morning all of whom anxiously awaited to see if the giant plant would in fact float. As members with Thrive Tours assisted Rouble and his orange craft into the water, cheers began to erupt around the marina when the pumpkin bobbled and then stabilized. It floats Rouble exclaimed. Crossing his fingers tightly for favourable current and wind conditions, Rouble will attempt to paddle to Hilton Beach a 65kilometre feat that would guarantee the world record for longest distance travelled in a pumpkin boat. But it wont be easy. Ill be kneeling for up to 16 hours in the pumpkin, with my upper body sticking out, while paddling the whole time, Rouble explains. Its going to be tough, but Im ready. The adventurous gardener is joined by Thrive Tours founders Brad Robinson and Amanda Cora, as well as Kyle Scali who is leading a team on his 30foot boat. They will act as Guinness World Record witnesses and ensure Rouble is safe throughout his journey. Theres so much crazy stuff going on in the world, Rouble says. I feel like we just need more pumpkins in the news. Im hoping this can just be an inspiration for kids, he adds. If you learn enough, research enough, and if youre crazy enough you can do anything. Even if you dont know if youll succeed or not, just try it. Readers can track Roubles progress today by clicking here.",1

With an even more hollowedout local media, it puts more responsibility on groups like the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition and its members to stay vigilant and uphold the values to which citizens so clearly adhere. Margaret Prophet is the executive director of the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition.","The environmental and housing policies of this government put much at risk, including places that clean our water, filter our air and prevent flooding, says advocate This is the second in a threepart series of guest columns from the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition leading up to An Evening with Margaret Atwood, a soldout fundraising event slated for Oct. 28. In my last column, I spoke about how our area, its economy, people and communities are deeply connected to the Greenbelt. I also outlined how this connection has translated into political pressure, with our region seeing some of the most active voices and outpouring of support in response to the corrupted Greenbelt land takeouts. The breadth and depth of this public support stands in stark contrast to the local MPPs who were among those voting to take land out of the Greenbelt. Recent polling confirms the deep connection our region has to the environment. In 2016, Environics found 94 per cent of us in Simcoe County wanted farmland and natural areas protected, and 82 per cent wanted urban development in places where infrastructure already existed in other words, within existing settlement areas and not as sprawl. This polling found the strength of support here was even stronger than that found in other areas, including York Region, Peel, Waterloo, Toronto and Durham. People also understand projects like the Bradford Bypass dont align with responsible development. Another poll, this time by Oracle, found a measly 29 per cent supported the project. This has since dropped to 20 per cent three years later. A large majority of us, 61 per cent, opposes the project. I outline all of this information because policy changes under this government, with the support of local MPPs, run counter to these values and the clear priorities residents have for development that is responsible, that doesnt end up costing us more in taxes, more in underfunded health care and education, more in lost farmland, air and water quality. Citizens and local organizations are instrumental in understanding these policies and their effects on their communities and local environment, and they are ringing the alarms on the impacts these changes will have. Case in point provincially significant wetlands. Simcoe County has a wealth of significant wetlands. Many overlap or are on the fringes of groundwater resources we depend on, like the Oro Moraine. Bill 23 which is now law reduces protection for these areas. By narrowing the definition of what is considered a provincially significant wetland, many of them may lose their status, and thus no longer receive the same protection. These changes also allow developers an outsized role in this process, giving them the power to reclassify wetlands to a downgraded status. Master naturalist Bob Bowles, who evaluated most of those significant wetlands, says it will leave them extremely vulnerable to exploitation and degradation. But it isnt just wetlands, groundwater and wildlife we should be concerned with here. In addition to the habitat and other ecosystem services wetlands provide, they offer some of the best protection against flooding. A recent report from this government outlines just how hard hit Ontario is likely to be by climate change. Flooding, it notes, increases conditions in which waterborne disease can develop, including by providing conditions for the proliferation of flies, ticks and mosquitoes that carry Lyme disease and West Nile virus. The report continues, outlining how irresponsible development in floodplains and wetlands leads to an increased risk of flooding in the future. Yet we continue to see policies that run counter to this science and put these floodplains and wetlands in more danger of being razed and paved. Other changes under Bill 23 severely curtail the ability of municipalities to generate revenue from development. This is revenue municipalities use to deliver necessary infrastructure and services to those same developments, and was part of a longstanding understanding roughly captured by the phrase, development pays for development. The County of Simcoe calculates these changes mean a loss of almost 200 million, with citizens now on the hook for a potential four to five per cent tax hike down the road. Note how the costs for development have been shifted from developers to the public. Municipal leaders face difficult choices as a result, either to hike tax rates, reduce services, or some combination thereof. Regardless of their choice, the public loses. Writ large, the environmental and housing policies of this government put much at risk, including places that clean our water, filter our air and prevent flooding. We want more development to happen in places where it makes the most sense. These are places where infrastructure currently exists and where it can be improved and expanded upon. This is what the residents of Simcoe County have stated in past polls. People here know that we can build vibrant communities, that we can have thriving and sustainable economies, and that all of this is built on the foundation of a healthy environment. If it werent for the leadership of local community groups and Indigenous communities, there would be little scrutiny of these policy changes. With an even more hollowedout local media, it puts more responsibility on groups like the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition and its members to stay vigilant and uphold the values to which citizens so clearly adhere. Margaret Atwood, acknowledging the leadership displayed by Indigenous communities and local groups in the Greenbelt takeout reversal, wants to ensure these local voices can remain strong into the future and is hosting a fundraiser at the end of October. She will be doubling the impact of public charitable donations made here, matching up to 10,000 in total. Together, we can protect what matters and have communities that reflect our values.

According to BC River Forecast Centre Hydrologist Jonathan Boyd, the Prince George area received approximately 350 millimetres of rain instead of the typical amount of 580. The rainfall just hasnt been what we would normally expect, and that has led to a situation now where flows are very, very low, Boyd said. Its a little bit tricky because we typically dont keep track of the drought over the winter, but at least heading into the winter, its not looking great, because this time of year, its not quite as wet as the coast, where we get fall storms that can replenish the water supply. Advertisement Boyd said the unusual part of this year was how quickly the drought kicked in. Partly it was related to the lingering drought that occurred last year. The snowpack, I would call it around normal to maybe slightly below normal, it certainly wasnt a dramatically low snowpack, Boyd said. April actually was a little bit of a cool month so there was a delay in the melt of snow, but May kicked in, and just how hot and dry May was led to the quickest melt weve recorded at our automated snow weather stations over maybe the past 50 years or so. He said flows were very high in May and June, but plummeted quickly after. By far this was the most drastic provincewide drought situation, and really was reflected with the unfortunate wildfire season as well. Boyd added during the winter, the demand for water is less, but theres still risks. There could be potential risk for freezing of rivers completely, just the potential for ice jam flooding, which are really specific challenges with maybe the lower ground water levels, he explained. Boyd said BC is moving into an El Nino season, which typically leads to warmer winters for the province. Advertisement It can vary, sometimes we do have the driest and lowest snowpacks in El Nino, sometimes we actually have very high snowpacks, he said. Itll be the low and midelevations where the expectation is therell be a little less snow accumulating because it might fall more as precipitation. He added it would take massive rainstorms from the coast spilling over into the interior to alleviate the drought conditions before winter starts. The likelihood is that the drought conditions will continue through the winter, and revolves around how much snow will fall in the winter season, combined with the potential and hope that more seasonal precipitation will occur in the March to June period. Boyd said it would take a normal to slightly above normal snowpack to help alleviate conditions throughout the winter. Its all just variable on the exact location everywhere, but I think of last year, when the snowpack was maybe normal around April 1st, but we had a really cold, wet spring, With that the snowmelt got delayed and by the time we got into the later season, relatively speaking, it was very high above normal. Boyd added the BC River Forecast Centre, will continue to monitor drought conditions over the next few weeks, and a decision will be made on if they will continue to monitor it through the winter.",1

At the moment, Arctic science is concentrated on its summer, with the Arctic winter which could tell us an enormous amount about the weather being under studied, Gray said. Russia has been frozen out of Western Arctic science following its invasion of Ukraine, Gray said. The Arctic Council, built with the purpose of boosting collaboration with Arctic nations, is becoming less influential and much of its important work has stalled. Following Russias freezing out of Arctic Council activity, it has been working with China in the Russian Arctic on oil and gas extraction, it said.","The escalating contributions to sea level rise from a warming Arctic could place up to 1.5 million UK properties at risk of flooding and requires enhanced measures across government to address mitigation and better coordinate on Arctic policy, says a report from the UK House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee. For too long the effects of a changing Arctic have been out of sight, out of mind, James Gray, an MP, and the Environmental Audit SubCommittee on Polar Research Chair said in comment Friday. Before melting glaciers and ice sheets contribute to widespread flooding and irreversible weather patterns in the UK, we must throw our full toolbox at understanding changes in the Arctic better. Numerous reports have established the risk of a sea level rise as Arctic ice melts. Rising sea levels pose a direct threat to the UK, with up to 1.5 million properties at an increased risk of flooding by 2080, the report said. The increase in floods here at home that will be caused by a changing Arctic will require difficult decisions by the Government. Knowledge gaps need to be urgently filled committee The report said the UK is a leader in polar research relative to its size and publishes 10 per cent of research papers on the Arctic, but that grant funding mechanisms when it comes to the North need to focus on longterm and not just shortterm projects. Among the committees recommendations are ensuring scientific monitoring research funding is available for projects that last a minimum of 10 years as well as an institute that could coordinate any Arctic research being done by universities in the UK to avoid duplicating work. At the moment, Arctic science is concentrated on its summer, with the Arctic winter which could tell us an enormous amount about the weather being under studied, Gray said. More collaboration is needed among UK universities to avoid repetition of scientific endeavours seeking out the same information, and with our international partners to learn and share resources. Alarmed by lack of ministers meetings on Arctic The committee also recommends the UK appoint a special polar envoy, saying the current distribution of Arctic responsibilities between four Ministers from different Government departments wasnt working. Whitehall has not been paying enough attention to the Arctic, Gray said. Four Ministers jotted around different departments with no oversight on Arctic policy is a missed opportunity. The fact the Ministers are yet to meet indicates a lack of enthusiasm on Arctic matters at the heart of Government they must meet quarterly given the drastic changes we are witnessing in our changing Arctic. The Government should now appoint a polar envoy. New fora needed for polar science as Arctic Council loses influence The report says Russias invasion of Ukraine and subsequent freeze on some 130 Arctic Council research projects involving Moscow has been devastating to polar science and will increasingly hamper the global response to climate change the longer it goes on. Russia has been frozen out of Western Arctic science following its invasion of Ukraine, Gray said. The Arctic Council, built with the purpose of boosting collaboration with Arctic nations, is becoming less influential and much of its important work has stalled. Our loss of access to Russian data is concerning, and 50 of the Arctic is now inaccessible to Western scientists. We must look into alternative international fora to champion and collaborate on Arctic research. The committee said Moscows increasing cooperation with China in the Arctic since the war is also pushing climate change further down the global agenda. Following Russias freezing out of Arctic Council activity, it has been working with China in the Russian Arctic on oil and gas extraction, it said. The Committee is concerned that the competition for resources and increased military presence by both Russia and NATO in the Arctic is diverting attention away from climate change in the region. The government has two months to respond to the committee report.

This means were quickly catching up with 2022s 3.1 billion insured loss year, the thirdhighest total of NatCat losses in the nations history. The industry can also expect a recordsetting number of catastrophes. Canada has seen at least 23 NatCats this year, Joel Baker, president and CEO of MSA Research shared with delegates at at the National Insurance Conference Canada NICC in September. Catastrophes are any weatherdriven event that tops 30 million or more in insured losses, as defined by Cat IQ. The previous record number of Cats in one year was 15, set in 2022. As insurers tally outstanding claims from wildfires, and with another quarter left before the fiscal year closes out, the industry can expect this number to rise. Ontario summer storms Summer storms and flash floods that hit parts of Ontario caused over 340 million in insured losses, according to initial CatIQ estimates. A quarter of these insured losses 80 million went toward replacing or repairing stormdamaged vehicles. The Ottawa region was hardest hit, with intense flash flooding, torrential downpours and violent wind gusts, Amanda Dean, interim vice president, Ontario, Insurance Bureau of Canada IBC said in a release. Five Ontario storms were designated as Cats this summer. First, there was over 30 million in insured damage caused by severe storms in Southwestern Ontario on Jul. 2021. A cold front crossed southern Ontario and Quebec, and led to an outbreak of severe thunderstorms, which produced wind gusts, including two confirmed tornadoes near South Buxton and Petrolia. Hail and downpours caused flooding for homes and businesses, and a microburst in Sarnia caused significant damage, including downed trees, power lines, damaged outdoor furniture and fences. Next, a period of hot, humid weather caused severe thunderstorms to cross southern Ontario Jul. 2829. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed and hit the Ottawa region, which was also afflicted by hail. Meanwhile, strong winds downed trees in Windsor, and heavy downpours led to flash flooding across the province. Damages totalled over 30 million. On Aug. 3, a summertime thunderstorm caused over 100 million in insured damage across southern Ontario. The frontal system created violent wind gusts, torrential downpours and hail. Lindsay and Ottawa were among the most significantly impacted regions, where underconstruction homes got knocked down. Trees, power lines and vehicles were damaged, or partially submerged by flooding. Then, Ottawa was hit by a cold front on Aug. 10, which caused 70 million in insured damage. Thunderstorms and rainfall hit parts of the city, with Nepean and Carson Grove bearing the brunt. Streets flooded across the metro area, leaving vehicles submerged and businesses flooded. Lastly, Aug. 2325 saw over 110 million in damage from southwestern Ontario flooding and storms. Tornadoes, hail, rainfall and heavy storms remnants of Hurricane Hilary downed power lines and left nearly 5,000 customers without power. Feature image by iStock.comSlavic",1

Data shows that shortterm rentals are diverting thousands of longterm rentals onto the shortterm market in B.C., taking away homes people need. Like many jurisdictions around the world, B.C. is responding to this growing challenge by taking action to regulate shortterm rentals and return homes back to the longterm rental market. In addition to the information on this page, please also see the October 16, 2023, ShortTerm Rental Accommodations Act news release, backgrounders, and technical briefing presentation. Page updated October 20, 2023 On this page ShortTerm Rental Accommodations Act B.C. is facing a housing crisis, with a shortage of all forms of attainable housing, including longterm rentals. The rise of shortterm rental of entire homes is taking away much needed homes for British Columbians. More than 16,000 entire homes are being used as shortterm rentals for the majority of the year in B.C. This is making it more challenging to find affordable longterm rentals. Many local governments have taken action to regulate shortterm rentals, but enforcement of bylaws is a challenge, and they have asked the Province for more tools and resources. The purpose of the new rules is to Give local governments stronger tools to enforce shortterm rental bylaws Return shortterm rental units to the longterm rental market Establish a new Provincial role in the regulation of shortterm rentals The new rules apply to all shortterm rentals being offered to the public including Offers hosted by a platform, where people reserve and pay for the rental service which may include for example, Airbnb, VRBO, Expedia, and FlipKey Offers on other web listing forums which may include for example, Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, and Craigslist Offers in classified ads in newspapers The new rules will not apply to Reserve lands Nisgaa Lands or the Treaty Lands of a Treaty First Nation unless the Nation chooses to opt into all or part of the legislation through a coordination agreement with the Province Hotels, motels Some of these new rules, like the ability of regional districts to issue business licenses and increase maximum penalties, will take effect immediately. Other changes, like the Provinces principal residence requirement and registration system will come later. Strengthening local government tools to enforce shortterm rental bylaws Increased fines and tickets The maximum fine that regional districts can set for prosecutions of bylaw offences under the Offence Act will increase from 2,000 to 50,000. This is consistent with the maximum fines for municipalities under the Community Charter. The Province also intends to increase the maximum municipal ticketing fine a local government may issue. These maximum fines could then be applied in Municipalities Regional districts Islands Trust New business licensing authority for regional districts Regional districts will be able to regulate and license shortterm rentals and other businesses, in similar ways to municipalities. This proposed change comes from amendments to the Local Government Act. Display of business license Some local governments require a business license for a host to operate a shortterm rental. In areas where a business license is required, shortterm rental hosts will be required to display a valid business license number on their listing. Platform accountability If a listing does not include a valid business license, where a business license is required by the local government, the shortterm rental platform must remove the listing at the request of the local government. Data sharing Local governments have been challenged with getting the data they need for bylaw enforcement. Under the new rules, shortterm rental platforms will be required to share information about shortterm listings with the Province. The Province can then share this information with local governments. The Province will keep the shortterm rental information confidential and will not disclose it to the public. Returning shortterm rental units to the longterm rental market Principal residence requirement The Province is implementing a provincial principal residence requirement which will limit shortterm rentals to The principal resident requirement will apply provincewide in municipalities with a population of 10,000 and over and adjacent communities. Future regulations are anticipated to set out areas or types of accommodation that will be exempt from the principal resident requirement including The 14 Resort Municipalities Most municipalities under 10,000 population except those adjacent to larger municipalities Regional district electoral areas Mountain Resort Areas and Designated Resort Regions Islands Trust Agritourism accommodations In exempt areas, local governments can request to opt in to the principal residence requirement. There will also be a process for communities with a higher vacancy rate to request to opt out of the principal residence requirement. The Provinces principal residence requirement would function as a floor meaning that local governments will still be able to have more restrictive bylaws depending on local needs, as many have already chosen to do. Shortterm rental hosts will continue to be required to follow local bylaws in place. List of communities where the principal residence requirement will apply Below is the list of communities where the principal residence requirement will apply the communities listed either have a population of more than 10,000 people or are adjacent to larger communities. There will be a process for the communities listed below with a higher vacancy rate to request to opt out of the principal residence requirement. Communities currently exempted from the principal residence requirement and not listed below may also be added, if a local government requests to join or opt in to the principal residence requirement.

Changes to legal nonconforming use protections Effective May 1, 2024, protections for nonconforming use of property will no longer apply to short term rentals. In some areas, these protections have historically allowed hosts to continue to use their property for shortterm rentals even when it was against the new rules set by the local government. Also effective May 1, 2024, the new provincial principal residence requirement will come into effect. This means that regardless of local zoning bylaws, the principal residence requirement will apply in designated communities listed above. Information about nonconforming use is available through local governments. Nonconforming use authorities will continue to exist for other land uses. Establishing provincial oversight of shortterm rentals Provincial registry The Province will establish a shortterm rental registry. This will help ensure that shortterm rental hosts and platforms are following the rules and provide local governments and the Province the information needed to follow up when they dont. Hosts will be required to include a provincial registration number on their listing. They will also have to include their business license number, if a business license is required by the local government. Platforms will be required to validate registration numbers on host listings against the Provinces registry data. Provincial compliance and enforcement unit In order to ensure the rules are being followed, the Province will establish a provincial compliance and enforcement unit. This unit will Track compliance Issue orders Administer penalties for violations Timeline The regulations and responsibilities under the proposed Act will come into effect at different times over the next two years through a phased approach.

Shortterm rental Shortterm rentals are accommodations provided to members of the public in a hosts property, in exchange for money, for a period of less than 90 consecutive days. They are generally tourist accommodations that are often found in residential or resort areas. They may be advertised via online platforms such as Airbnb, VRBO, Expedia and FlipKey, but may also include shortterm rental offers on other web forums including Facebook Marketplace, or found in classified ads in newspapers. Principal residence A principal residence is the residence an individual lives in for a longer period during a calendar year than any other place. Platform service Platform services are the facilitation of promotion and transactions for reservations and payments related to shortterm rental accommodation services in British Columbia, provided by a platform. Secondary suite A secondary suite is a selfcontained living unit with its own kitchen, sleeping area, and washroom facilities, and which is contained within a dwelling unit. Accessory dwelling unit An accessory dwelling unit often referred to as an ADU is a selfcontained living unit with its own kitchen, sleeping area, and washroom facilities, and which is located on the same property as a dwelling unit. An accessory dwelling unit is sometimes referred to as a garden suite, laneway home, carriage house or garage suite. Shortterm rentals versus tenancies In general, a booking made on a shortterm rental platform is not covered under the Residential Tenancy Act, but there are circumstances in which a tenancy may be established. If there is uncertainty about the legal requirements related to a specific accommodation arrangement, it is best to speak with a lawyer.

Established in 1929 as one of the first migratory bird sanctuaries in the country, the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary is the only federallyrecognized urban facility of its kind in Canada. Over time, human use, natural processes and largescale events such as the 2013 flood have impacted the parks features, including the 100year old lagoon, outlets and channels. The outfall structures, which regulate water levels, reached the end of their lifecycle and the inlet to the lagoon was filled with sediment, disconnecting the lagoon from the river and impacting water and wildlife health as well as fish passage through the area. A study was conducted to identify opportunities to improve the area, repair damage and enhance flood and erosion control. An initial restoration plan was shared with Calgarians in 2018 and construction began in spring 2022 as a collaborative effort between Infrastructure Services, Operational Services and Public Art. This is a unique project that provides the opportunity to enhance the natural environment while building on Calgarys pedestrian infrastructure and providing functional art for community members to enjoy, says the General Manager of Infrastructure Services Michael Thompson. The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary showcases so many of the varied amenities that Calgary has to offer. The improvements made through the Reconnection project are a reflection of the collaborative efforts of many City teams to provide the best outcome for Calgarians. Over a period of three years, artist Tim Knowles worked closely with the project team of engineers, hydrologists and naturalists to help design the path of a new channel to reconnect the Bow River into the lagoon and out through a water meadow. In addition to landscaping and habitat creation, the design also includes a new functional art pedestrian crossing, giving visitors a new way to access and enjoy the park. The Log Jam celebrates the history of the site as a former sawmill, while also complementing the natural environment surrounding it, says artist Tim Knowles. The crossing is a hybrid structure part bridge, part flood control mechanism, bird blind and log jam. The design incorporates native lumber sourced from the site where possible and includes a cantilever timber deck with benches and screened viewing areas for bird watching. As part of the Fish Habitat Compensation program, new pools and shallow riffles were added to restore fish habitat, provide protection and oxygenate the water. More than 90 new trees will help improve the health of the riparian forest and replenish the much older tree canopy. Closer to the ground, new plants, shrubs and grass will increase biodiversity. As the site is a federal bird sanctuary, the primary goal of the project was to restore and support the natural environment, while also providing features to enhance the experience for park users, says Project Manager Ren Letourneau. Great care was taken during project design to maximize habitat benefits and to minimize impacts to birds and other wildlife during construction. Funding for this 9.7 million project was provided by The City of Calgary, the Government of Albertas Watershed Resiliency and Restoration Program and Environment Climate Change Canadas Environmental Damages fund. To learn more, visit engage.calgary.caIBS. Quotes The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary Reconnection project is a shining example of how, by working collaboratively, we can restore the natural environment, protect wildlife habitat and create green spaces where visitors can enjoy and learn about the environment for years to come. The Government of Canada is proud to support projects like this across the country through the Environmental Damages Fund which turns penalties for environmental infractions into projects which improve the natural environment. Minister Steven Guilbeault, Environment and Climate Change The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary Reconnection project is an excellent example of nature being maintained in an urban area. The thoughtful planning that went into this project will have a positive impact for years to come through more vibrant and sustainable wildlife habitat, more effective flood resiliency and water quality, and a better experience for park users. Minister Rebecca Schulz, Environment and Protected Areas Part of what makes Calgary one of the most livable cities in the world is our vast outdoor recreational opportunities. Our parks are critical infrastructure that must be well maintained to protect biodiversity and Calgarians wellbeing. This investment will ensure the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary remains a treasured place for generations to come. Mayor Jyoti Gondek The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary has been an important part of the local community for over 80 years and is beloved by Calgarians and visitors alike. The improvements made through this reconnection project will help to ensure the continued vibrancy of the park into the next 80 years and beyond. Ward 9 Councillor, Gian Carlo Carra",1

While it will be rewarding to bring the grapes in, the numbers will be historically low thanks to the unprecedented vine damage that occurred last winter. Wine lovers are quick to feel empathy when they hear about their fave producers getting hit by fires or flood, but the freeze that happened last December was a catastrophe on a far higher level. Heres the bottom line the harvest is forecast to be 54 percent less than normal, with 45 percent of the vines suffering longterm damage and 29 percent requiring complete replanting. Which all offers a perfect chance for us to rally around these wineries and snap up the bottles they are releasing. And while we think of harvest as a generic term, the reality is that in a highly variable climatic zone like the Okanagan, where we grow such a vast array of grape varietals, there will be some producers who pick grapes as early as midAugust and others who might start as late as Octoberand thats not even considering the hardy souls who brave the freezing temperatures to make ice wine. But even with those broad guidelines, there is much variation within each window of picking time. Do you want your chardonnay to be light and crisp or round and warm Will your cabernet franc be juicy or powerful Here are three options that celebrate three distinctive stages of harvest. Tantalus Blanc de Noir, 31 Its odd to think of red grapes, even the delicate pinot noir, as early ripeners, but for his sparkling wine, winemaker David Paterson wants low alcohol and elevated acidity this wine is fantastically vibrant so these grapes are often the first picked on the East Kelowna Tantalus estate. tantalus.ca Liquidity Viognier, 30 Viognier is traditionally one of the latest white grapes to be harvested, as winemakers want to exploit the signature perfumed nose and soft, rich mouthfeel, but Liquiditys Amy Paynter picks hers early to craft a viognier that has more acidity than most plus elegant, light, elevated florals. liquiditywines.com Phantom Creek Estates Cabernet Franc, 42 Cabernet franc is always near the last to be harvested picked too early, it displays green and overly herbaceous qualitiesbut leave it too long and it can become hot and flabby. Phantom Creeks Mark Beringer chooses the perfect middle ground, keeping some freshness and wild herb characteristics as a partner to the ripe dark cherry and black currant notes. phantomcreekestates.com This story was originally published in the SeptemberOctober 2023 issue of Vancouver Magazine.",1

That was seriously the best pumpkin a guy could ask for in doing something like this. There were strangers coming from Bruce Mines and Thessalon to see this crazy guy in a pumpkin, he says. Thrive Tours said that would be a good river to break the world record, he says. Waiting to hear back from Guinness for confirmation, Rouble believes he is the furthest to paddle in a pumpkin boat on the Great Lakes.","I fought for every metre Despite missing the Guinness World Record, enthusiastic gardener Brent Rouble paddled 23 km in his giant pumpkin on Sunday He may not have broken the Guinness World Record for furthest distance travelled in a pumpkin boat, but Sault resident Brent Rouble couldnt be happier for the memorable experience he had this weekend. After growing a 900pound pumpkin in his eastend backyard, the local geologist managed to paddle in the giant plant for just over 23 kilometres along St. Marys River and the open waters of Lake Huron on Sunday before some tough waves forced him to stop. His eightandahalfhour journey with virtually no breaks began in front of an excited crowd yesterday morning at the Bellevue Marina. With the support of Thrive Tours and a safety crew team led by his friend Kyle Scali, Roubles trek came to a bittersweet end near Echo Bay around 430 p.m. Although he was feeling slightly sore this morning, Rouble says the temporary pain is beyond worth it. It was such a cool adventure the sights were absolutely beautiful, he told SooToday. That was seriously the best pumpkin a guy could ask for in doing something like this. It was tough as nails, it floated perfectly, and it was stable. I didnt feel worried about tipping at all. While his unconventional water craft miraculously withstood a number of challenges over the course of that afternoon, high waves and luckless currents inevitably made the goal of breaking the 62kilometre world record an impossibility. I fought for every metre, he says. I thought the wind would help, but for half the trip, the wind was actually against me. The current didnt help either it was working against us the whole time. Some of the waves were coming into the pumpkin and getting me pretty soaked as well. But its a world record its not supposed to be easy. Rouble achieved a maximum speed of five kilometreshour, or walking speed, but there were times he was only travelling one kilometrehour or less. His average speed finished at just over two kilometreshour, which meant he would have had to paddle for more than 30 hours at that pace to claim the record. I was literally crawling to St. Joseph Island, he says. The speed just wasnt enough. The currents really were the only thing that didnt go right through all of this. I knew it wasnt going to be safe to go all through the night and into the morning. Despite some hardship along the way, the passionate gardener says he felt all the good vibes from his supporters which helped greatly. There were strangers coming from Bruce Mines and Thessalon to see this crazy guy in a pumpkin, he says. I heard people on the Canadian side yelling go Brent go sometimes, which was a huge help because it definitely got tough. American boaters were passing us, and we saw them doing double takes since they were wondering what we were doing which was pretty funny. Preparing to do it all again next year, Rouble says hes looking for a sponsor to help his team travel to the Grand River in southern Ontario as he hopes to grow an even larger pumpkin and break the distance record there. Thrive Tours said that would be a good river to break the world record, he says. You need fastmoving water, and pumpkins do not paddle well theyre too big and too round. Unless you have fast water, you wont be moving that quickly. If I can grow a pumpkin with a bit of legroom, I could go for days, he laughed. Waiting to hear back from Guinness for confirmation, Rouble believes he is the furthest to paddle in a pumpkin boat on the Great Lakes. While hes unlikely to attempt that water system again, he encourages anyone up to the challenge to give it a try. Its definitely not easy, but it is beatable, he says. If anyone wants to beat it, just grow a giant pumpkin and pick a good day for currents. Grateful for the communitys response to his bold venture, Rouble is hopeful his story will help inspire the younger generation to always think big. I heard stories about kids getting pumped up about this, he says. Some of them were curious about world records and even about gardening. Im hoping we inspired some kids to do some good in the community.",1

Chinese EV makers are drawn to Europe because auto import tariffs are just 10 versus 27.5 in the U.S., independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt said. MG owned by SAIC Motor, Chinas biggest automaker is the largest Chinese EV player in Europe. One reason Chinese companies can offer highquality cars at affordable prices stems from the rules to enter the Chinese market. Chinese EV makers, meanwhile, are trying to stand out in a crowded field.","LONDON AP When Laima SpringeJanssen was looking to replace her Frenchmade gasolinepowered SUV with an electric car, she considered models from Volvo and Nissan. The Volvo extras she wanted would have busted her budget, while the Nissan lacked the wow factor. The Copenhagen, Denmark, resident ended up buying a compact SUV from Chinas BYD. I really, really love the car, SpringeJanssen said. For the equivalent of about 50,000, the Atto 3 SUV came with all these goodies like a 360degree dash cam, two years of free charging and an extra set of winter tires. Her husband likes it so much hes considering buying another BYD to replace their other car, from Volkswagens Skoda brand. Im sorry, Europe. Go home, she said. China has a better offer. Her enthusiasm underscores how Chinese automakers are winning over drivers as they make major inroads into Europes electric vehicle market, challenging longestablished homegrown brands in an industry thats key to the continents green energy transition. The competitive threat has spurred the European Union to launch an investigation into Beijings support for its EV industry. That adds to techrelated tensions between the West and China, which is one of Europes biggest trading partners and the worlds biggest auto market. Chinas EV onslaught, along with massive U.S. clean energy funding that has drawn investment away from Europe, shows how the 27nation bloc is caught in the middle of the global race for green technology. Chinese EV makers are drawn to Europe because auto import tariffs are just 10 versus 27.5 in the U.S., independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt said. Europe also has the worlds secondbiggest EV battery market after China. Nevermind the geopolitics. Climateconscious car buyers in Europe who are grappling with an increased cost of living rave about how Chinese EVs are affordable yet packed with features and stylish design. Concerns about the threat to local carmakers and jobs just arent a factor for them. British retiree John Kirkwood replaced his Volkswagen Passat three years ago with an MG5 station wagon because the 30,000pound 36,000 price tag wiped the floor with its nearest rival a Kia that cost thousands more. Its nice. Its quiet, its refined and very quick, Kirkwood said, adding that he had few qualms about British brand MGs Chinese ownership. MG owned by SAIC Motor, Chinas biggest automaker is the largest Chinese EV player in Europe. BYD, backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, is growing fast. Theres also Geely, which owns Swedens Volvo and a stable of EV brands including Polestar, Lynk Co. and British sportscar maker Lotus. Behind them are a slew of startups, like NIO and Xpeng. Their combined sales are a sliver of the 9.2 million vehicles sold in Europe every year, but they have been gobbling up a piece of the smaller EV market at an astonishing pace. Chinese automakers account for only about 3 of Western Europes overall car market but 8.4 of the EV market, up from 6.2 last year and almost nothing in 2019, according to Schmidts data. The surge is stoking fears about Europes automotive industry, an economic powerhouse centered in France and Germany that employs millions of workers, staying competitive as it transitions from fossil fuels to electricity. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars, with prices kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. The commission, the EUs executive arm, formally opened its investigation this month, saying it would take up to 13 months and could result in import duties. Beijing voiced strong dissatisfaction and vowed to firmly safeguard Chinese companies rights. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the EU probe is based on subjective assumptions, lacks enough evidence and goes against World Trade Organization rules. Complicating matters, global automakers build vehicles in China and have exported 164,300 this year to Europe, including BMWs iX3 SUV made in northeastern Shenyang and Teslas Model 3 and Y produced in Shanghai, according to Schmidts data. That means one in every five EVs sold in Europe is a Chinese import. A commission spokesman said the investigation is looking at Chinas EV exports regardless of the brand. Stellantis, which owns French auto brands Peugeot and Citroen as well as Italys Alfa Romeo and Fiat, is vowing to fight back against Chinas EVs. In a recent earnings call, CEO Carlos Tavares said the worlds No. 3 automaker is responding to a Chinese invasion in a European market with a new Citroen eC3 cheap compact. Stellantis faces added pressure from a union strike in the U.S. over EV battery plant jobs. Executives at Shanghaibased Aiways, a startup headed by Volvos former China sales chief, rejected accusations that Beijing provides a helping hand. Were not selling inside China, were not being subsidized in China, said Alexander Klose, vice president of overseas operations. Yes, we obviously have some subsidies for putting a plant somewhere, which is, I think, what everybody has in Europe. Aiways is focusing on Europe and Israel instead of China, where the auto market is so crowded that we dont think it makes sense to compete right now, Klose said. The EU should be working on getting to a green future rather than keeping competition out, he said. One reason Chinese companies can offer highquality cars at affordable prices stems from the rules to enter the Chinese market. Global automakers had to team up with local companies, providing them crucial automaking knowhow. They were kind of like the sous chefs to the Western companies, said Schmidt, the auto analyst. The situation now is those sous chefs are opening up their own restaurants and, in some cases, better than their masters restaurants. Also helping level the playing field is batterypowered motors being less complex to build than internal combustion engines and requiring fewer workers. Thats a problem for European brands with big workforces that will need years to revamp operations, Schmidt said. Chinese EV makers, meanwhile, are trying to stand out in a crowded field. SUV maker Great Wall Motors EV subbrand Ora is targeting women, with cars it says are designed for their body sizes and daily needs. The Ora Funky Cat, with throwback round headlights, an exclamation mark on its hood badge, and a 32,000pound 38,600 price tag, appealed to British scriptwriter Justin Nicholls, who bought one for his wife. The looks are awesome, and the tech great. Its so easy to drive, yet feels like a lot larger car and feels premium, he said. It also appealed to Nicholls because its different from the Volkswagens, Peugeots and BMWs common on British roads I think it is a lot more quirky than European cars.

Environment Canada has issued rainfall warnings for most of B.C.s South Coast including Metro Vancouver, most of Vancouver Island, Howe Sound, Whistler, and the Sea to Sky Highway from Squamish to Whistler, as an atmospheric river moves into the region. Global BC Senior meteorologist Kristi Gordon said the incoming system was classified at a rank of AR3 on a scale of one to five, according to the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. Thats significant enough to douse the region, but not as intense as some fall and winter storms B.C. has seen in recent years. 141 B.C.s South Coast in for a soaking as seasons first atmospheric river arrives Metro Vancouver is forecast to receive from 40 millimetres of rain up to 80 millimetres close to the North Shore mountains.

Whistler and the Sea to Sky Highway area could also receive up to 110 millimetres. Gordon said the heavy rain was forecast to stretch over a 36 to 48hour period from Tuesday evening into Wednesday. B.C.s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change also issued a bulletin Tuesday evening, warning that the heavy rain could cause other hazards, following a summer of drought and wildfires. 539 Heavy rain after summer drought raises flood risk Rainfall on impacted areas can generate high surface water runoff and erosion due to a lack of vegetation, leading to a possibility of localized flooding and landslides although widespread or severe impacts are not expected as part of this atmospheric river system, the ministry said in a media release. Story continues below advertisement The B.C. River Forecast Centre has also issued highstreamflow advisories for multiple regions, rivers and their tributaries, including the South Coast, North Thompson, South Thompson, Upper Columbia, Vancouver Island, Sunshine Coast, and Howe Sound. People are being urged to stay away from fastmoving waterways and not to drive through flood water. The province is also using the storm as a chance to reiterate its emergency preparedness advice, including preparing homes for possible flooding by clearing storm drains, gutters and perimeters and packing grabandgo bags that can be used for any emergency situation. Global News spoke with Environment Canada meteorologist Alyssa Charbonneau, on Wednesday. Atmospheric rivers are more common in B.C.s fall. It is one of the ways that recharges our rainfall after relatively dry summers, she said. They are very narrow bands of highintensity moisture, and as it approaches the coast and the mountains it releases its rain. Charbonneau said now is a good time to check drainage around homes and neighbourhoods to help mitigate localized flooding.",1

MARIE He may not have broken the Guinness World Record for furthest distance travelled in a pumpkin boat, but Sault resident Brent Rouble couldnt be happier for the memorable experience he had this weekend. After growing a 900pound pumpkin in his eastend backyard, the local geologist managed to paddle in the giant plant for just over 23 kilometres along St. Marys River and the open waters of Lake Huron on Sunday before some tough waves forced him to stop. His eightandahalfhour journey with virtually no breaks began in front of an excited crowd yesterday morning at the Bellevue Marina. With the support of Thrive Tours and a safety crew team led by his friend Kyle Scali, Roubles trek came to a bittersweet end near Echo Bay around 430 p.m. Although he was feeling slightly sore this morning, Rouble says the temporary pain is beyond worth it. It was such a cool adventure the sights were absolutely beautiful, he told SooToday. That was seriously the best pumpkin a guy could ask for in doing something like this. It was tough as nails, it floated perfectly, and it was stable. I didnt feel worried about tipping at all. While his unconventional water craft miraculously withstood a number of challenges over the course of that afternoon, high waves and luckless currents inevitably made the goal of breaking the 62kilometre world record an impossibility. I fought for every metre, he says. I thought the wind would help, but for half the trip, the wind was actually against me. The current didnt help either it was working against us the whole time. Some of the waves were coming into the pumpkin and getting me pretty soaked as well. But its a world record its not supposed to be easy. Rouble achieved a maximum speed of five kilometreshour, or walking speed, but there were times he was only travelling one kilometrehour or less. His average speed finished at just over two kilometreshour, which meant he would have had to paddle for more than 30 hours at that pace to claim the record. I was literally crawling to St. Joseph Island, he says. The speed just wasnt enough. The currents really were the only thing that didnt go right through all of this. I knew it wasnt going to be safe to go all through the night and into the morning. Despite some hardship along the way, the passionate gardener says he felt all the good vibes from his supporters which helped greatly. There were strangers coming from Bruce Mines and Thessalon to see this crazy guy in a pumpkin, he says. I heard people on the Canadian side yelling go Brent go sometimes, which was a huge help because it definitely got tough. American boaters were passing us, and we saw them doing double takes since they were wondering what we were doing which was pretty funny. Preparing to do it all again next year, Rouble says hes looking for a sponsor to help his team travel to the Grand River in southern Ontario as he hopes to grow an even larger pumpkin and break the distance record there. Thrive Tours said that would be a good river to break the world record, he says. You need fastmoving water, and pumpkins do not paddle well theyre too big and too round. Unless you have fast water, you wont be moving that quickly. If I can grow a pumpkin with a bit of legroom, I could go for days, he laughed. Waiting to hear back from Guinness for confirmation, Rouble believes he is the furthest to paddle in a pumpkin boat on the Great Lakes. While hes unlikely to attempt that water system again, he encourages anyone up to the challenge to give it a try. Its definitely not easy, but it is beatable, he says. If anyone wants to beat it, just grow a giant pumpkin and pick a good day for currents. Grateful for the communitys response to his bold venture, Rouble is hopeful his story will help inspire the younger generation to always think big. I heard stories about kids getting pumped up about this, he says. Some of them were curious about world records and even about gardening. Im hoping we inspired some kids to do some good in the community.",1

When developing a new area, there are many factors developers, municipalities and other entities must consider, including basic amenities such as water, sewage, hydro, and internet access. Other considerations include whether new developments and communities are safe and resilient to the threat of climate change and if they affect environmentally sensitive areas. According to the Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment technical report, the biggest climate changerelated threats to development are precipitation and wildfires. Both hazards have the potential to damage buildings and shorten the service life of infrastructure such as bridges and roads. In the past two years alone, several areas in North America have experienced historic precipitation, resulting in damaging floods. In July 2023, Nova Scotia experienced record rainfall, causing approximately 170 million in damage to homes, roads and bridges, and four lives being lost. While flooding is a regular occurrence in isolated parts of Manitoba, the province experienced widespread flooding in 2022. This year, Boston experienced the secondwettest summer in recorded history, and many parts of Massachusetts saw flooding. Residents were asked to avoid contact with rivers and beaches as untreated sewage was released with stormwater. Back at home, AdjalaTosoronto, Mono, New Tecumseth and Shelburne experienced significant flooding in June 2017. Crops were badly damaged, causing lost profits for farmers around the area. The emergency spillway at the Tottenham Dam also suffered excessive damage and has since been repaired. A number of roads were closed for a short period of time. Although the water was just three to six inches deep, the water took about a week to drain from the fields. In Ontario, conservation authorities are responsible for protecting lives and properties from flood and erosion. In the Nottawasaga watershed, this starts with ensuring development is not built in floodplains and other spaces that are prone to flooding and erosion. These areas include rivers, streams and wetlands. During the building process, it is important to take certain precautions to ensure floodplains, slopes and wetlands are not affected. The Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority NVCA works with land developers to ensure these precautions are implemented, and that new development does not create flooding and erosion effects on our communities. In our September Village Media column, we mentioned the important role wetlands play in flood reduction and providing important wildlife habitat. This is also true for natural areas beside rivers and streams. Wetlands are crucial habitat features for wildlife, providing a unique environment where various plant and animal species thrive. The sheltered water and abundant plant life offer ideal conditions for fish and amphibians to lay their eggs and for young animals to grow. Wetlands are also critical stopover points for migratory birds, offering them a place to rest and refuel during long journeys. Visit the NVCA website to learn more about the health of the wetlands, rivers, forests and groundwater in your area.

Its been 30 years since the Great World Flood, which left most of the country blanketed by water. In an effort to keep the 100,000 remaining residents of Winnipeg safe, the city has been walled off from whichever pockets of society remain. The Winnipeg you know, love and tolerate is gone in Glad to Be Here, the upcoming project from the everinventive Theatre by the River in the companys first show since 2021s Meet Me at Dawn. Andrea del Campo from left, Karl Thordarson, Michael Lawrenchuk and Mel Marginet live in the waterlogged New Winnipeg in Glad to Be Here.

Theatre Preview Glad to Be Here Theatre by the River Portage Avenue Church, 1420 Portage Ave. Opens Thursday, runs to Saturday. Oct. 28 Tickets 1637 at wfp.togladtobehere Theatre by the River, founded in 2005, has spent the last two decades dedicated to making work that gets people talking, says artistic director Mel Marginet. And by honing in on a climate disaster that feels somewhat farfetched but also somewhat realistic, the company hopes its latest production leads people to question where they are, who they are and how even a city can disappear under the crash of a tidal wave. Glad to Be Here started in 2019, when creators Marginet, Daina Leitold, Derek Leenhouts and Karl Thordarson gathered to create a show about here and now, Marginet says. The group knew it wanted to tackle questions about the rise of alternate facts and online conspiracy theories. They put on their tinfoil hats, and began to imagine what kind of calamity Winnipeg would succumb to. We did the science, Leitold says they figured out a flood would be the likeliest culprit, with waters flowing into the city from Hudson Bay. We got all heady imagining what that world would look like, she adds, with the group certain there was enough material for a futuristic, dystopian narrative. But then we said you know what we need A playwright. Its good to have someone at the helm to steer the ship. So the company enlisted the awardwinning playwright Ginny Collins The Flats to work her magic. The resulting story is set in New Winnipeg, which after 30 years of isolation is opening its gates to wanderers from other territories across the country seeking refuge. Director, Jacquie Loewen left and Production Designer, Daina Leitold right enjoy some Jeannes Cake between rehearsals. Mike Deal Winnipeg Free Press Cassandra Patricia Hunter is the mysterious leader, written by Collins as the mouthpiece for a sales pitch for new settlers to come to the only remaining Prairie metropolis. Its the first time anyone has been invited in to see behind these walls, says Leitold, who serves as production designer, creating waterproof costumes for the cast and procuring lifejackets for audience members. The shows creators insist there is no Splash Zone, because that would ruin the carpets at the Portage Avenue Church. Its a massive production, with a cast of eight live performers, nine video performers and five audio performers, including Michael Lawrenchuk, Andrea del Campo, Lara Rae, Jordan Phillips and Gabriel Daniels. Ginny was able to take those initial thoughts and ideas and create characters who are very good representations of those ideas, not as ideological representatives, but as actual human beings, says Jacquie Loewen, the productions director. Glad to Be Here has plenty of moving parts, which made Loewen, one of the citys most indemand stagefight coordinators, an ideal choice to direct a performance centred on the global fight against climate change. In this world weve imagined, Portage Place is vitally important, says Leitold, slipping into a sales pitch. All food is grown there, thanks to its natural greenhouse effect, and it can store and purify water in these gorgeous fountains. You will arrive to a lively, active, colourful tradeshow event where we are going to wow you with the sights, sounds, tastes, smells and the touches of New Winnipeg. Its a feast for the senses. The show doesnt require audience participation, but it is a production that will benefit from the guests buying into the concept, Loewen says. I use this term very carefully, but this is a style that requires you as an audience member to be a part of the show, she says. Youre not required to do anything other than listen, but the fact is, your presence there is what makes the show happen, which Ive come to realize is a very potent esthetic choice.

Even if the audience is mute, which they should be, they will still be within this immersive world, this imagined future place inhabited by humans who are humaning to the best of their abilities. It becomes unavoidable that the audience leaves feeling complicit and questioning where they were. The shows creators had to imagine how humans would react in such an apocalyptic setting. When they first began talking about the show in 2019, some of those reactions seemed ridiculous, says Marginet. Any time you write something futuristic, you inevitably ask, Would this actually happen But we lived through Toilet Paper Gate, she says.

Originally ratified in 1964, the Columbia River Treaty is a watersharing agreement between Canada and the U.S. that provide for downstream flood control management and power generation on the Columbia River. The treaty led to the construction of three dams in British Columbia and one in Montana. However, it has been historically criticized for a lack of consultation with Indigenous communities, as the reservoirs flooded out cultural and heritage sites, and impacted ecosystems, forests, agriculture and tourism values. While the original main elements of the treaty emphasized flood control and power generation, ecosystem function and habitat impacts from hydropower operations has become a significant new discussion point led by Indigenous Nations in the modernization talks.",0

More than 80 million or close to 25 per cent of these losses went toward replacing or repairing stormdamaged vehicles. Ontarians once again experienced a summer of severe storms and floods that damaged or destroyed homes, vehicles and businesses, said Amanda Dean, interim vicepresident, Ontario, Insurance Bureau of Canada IBC. While much of southern Ontario was affected, the Ottawa region was hardest hit by these summer storms, with intense flash flooding, torrential downpours and violent wind gusts. Our member insurers have been on the ground since day one and continue to work with the large number of policyholders whose property was damaged by these events. The frequency and severity of flooding and severe storms in Ontario and across Canada continue to increase each year, IBC said. The following storms from the summer of 2023 have been designated catastrophes, which is used to describe insured damage estimates that total more than 30 million. The highest damages were seen in the following areas On July 2021, a cold front crossing southern Ontario and Quebec led to an outbreak of severe thunderstorms, causing more than 30 million in damage. Storms produced strong wind gusts, including two confirmed tornadoes near South Buxton and Petrolia, as well as large hailstones and downpours that caused flooding. A microburst in Sarnia caused significant damage, including downed trees and power lines and damaged outdoor furniture and fences. On July 2829, a period of hot, humid weather resulted in severe thunderstorms across southern Ontario, causing more than 30 million in damage. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed on July 28 and 29, with some of the strongest storms hitting the Ottawa region. Ottawa was pelted by hail up to the size of tennis balls, while strong winds brought down trees in Windsor. Heavy downpours also led to flash flooding. On Aug. 3, a summertime frontal system moving through southern Ontario sparked severe thunderstorms, causing more than 100 million in damage. The hardesthit areas saw large hailstones, violent wind gusts and torrential downpours. Lindsay and Ottawa were among the most significantly impacted regions. On Aug. 10, a cold front sliding through southeastern Ontario sparked a series of thunderstorms across the Ottawa region, targeting parts of the city with an intense burst of rainfall that caused flash flooding. The event caused more than 70 million in damage. While much of southern Ontario witnessed storms related to this front, conditions produced heavy rainfall over parts of the Ottawa region. A swath from Nepean to Carson Grove was the hardest hit, with streets turning to rivers as storms moved from southwest to northeast across the city, leaving vehicles submerged and businesses flooded. On Aug. 2325, moisture associated with the remnants of Hurricane Hilary fed thunderstorms over southwestern Ontario, causing more than 110 million. This led to a series of heavy storms, producing significant rainfall, multiple tornadoes and large hailstones. More than 200 millimeters of rain fell on some communities, resulting in flooded roads, basements and properties.",1

Puis dimanche, de la pluie supplmentaire pour un total de 120 millimtres. Cest exceptionnel et a narrive pas souvent , plaide le maire de SaintBruno, Ludovic Gris Farand. En comparaison, le territoire a reu 27 mm de pluie pendant tout le mois de septembre. Pour M. Gris Farand, le contraste est norme . En entrevue, il confirme des problmes sur les rues JulietteBliveau et des Tilleuls. Nous avons reu des appels de citoyens inonds dans ces deux rues. Il y a eu un cas aussi sur Bedford et sur place Lvis. Du moins, ce sont les signalements que la Ville a reus , explique le maire, qui confirme des accumulations dans certaines rues en raison de puisards bloqus par des amoncellements de feuilles. Le maire souligne que diverses raisons expliquent les cas particuliers dinondation, allant de conduits surchargs la maison ellemme . La veille de ces pluies intenses, la Ville avait ordonn linspection gnrale des cours deau et des grilles de sorties.

Une dernire tourne des cours deau a t rpte ensuite, en vue dune prochaine pluie intense . M. Gris Farand affirme que les citoyens ont lobligation de se procurer une pompe submersible afin de rejeter les dbits deaux pluviales. Ils doivent aussi sassurer davoir un clapet antiretour. Cest un rglement de la Ville. Dans le cas de JulietteBliveau, il y a une portion plus basse de la rue, ce qui fait en sorte que la nappe phratique est plus leve. On encourage donc les gens se munir dun clapet et dune pompe fonctionnelle. Contacte par le journal, une rsidente de cette voie affirme que cest connu pour le clapet, mais pas pour la pompe. Il y a peu de temps, la rue JulietteBliveau a subi une rfection. Ce qui me chicote, cest que les infrastructures et lasphalte ont t refaits cet t. On se demande si les travaux ont t bien faits, si des fissures auraient pu tre causes par les vibrations, si les gouts auraient t laisss pleins de gravelle aprs les travaux , note cette mme citoyenne de JulietteBliveau. cette interrogation, le maire confirme que des travaux ont t effectus, mais sur la chausse et sur le remplacement des conduits daqueduc, pas sur les rseaux dgout, encore en bon tat . Une pluie de rcurrence de 100 ans De son ct, le maire de SaintBasileleGrand, Yves Lessard, parle dune pluie de rcurrence de 100 ans pour expliquer la situation des 7 et 8 octobre. Cest une pluie exceptionnelle que nous avons reue en lespace de 24 heures, selon les donnes des stations bases dans la rgion. Maintenant, avec les changements climatiques, nous apprhendons que ce genre de phnomne revienne plus souvent, que la rcurrence soit rduite, peuttre 50 ans , indique M. Lessard. Ce dernier confirme les accumulations deau dans divers secteurs de la municipalit. Sur le rang des Vingt, la hauteur de la rue Prvert et devant lAcadmie des SacrsCurs, sur la rue Alvares et sur la piste cyclable de la rue Principale, entre lavenue du MontBruno et Alvares.

It almost seems about a third of normal rainfall wed see in the last six months has happened in the last day, he told CityNews. He advises those near rivers and other bodies of water to take caution, as water levels can change quickly. For people who might be out and about, we think this is going to be a real change in the rivers. Were going to see this rapid rise and from a safety perspective, remaining cautious around rivers is important at this time, he said. On the drought front, Campbell says the rain will help river levels get back to normal, but things like groundwater will take longer to recover. Were still trying to get a handle on the longerterm implication. I think thats the one where it can be a little more subtle in terms of the longerterm drought things, he explained.

Rainfall warnings cover most of Vancouver Island, as well as the Sunshine Coast, Howe Sound, Whistler and Metro Vancouver as Environment Canada pinpoints a firehoselike band pumping moisture from the subtropics directly at the B.C. coast. More than 200 millimetres of rain could fall along sections of western Vancouver Island, while 80 to 110 millimetres are forecast across the Howe Sound, Whistler and SeatoSky regions before the storm is expected to ease late in the day. Up to 80 millimetres could drench Metro Vancouver, and the weather office says localized flooding in lowlying areas is possible everywhere the warnings are posted. The rainshadow effect will protect much of the Interior from heavy downpours, but a special weather statement covers the West Columbia region of southeast B.C., which could see as much as 50 millimetres of rain by early Thursday. High streamflow advisories are in effect for Vancouver Island and the inner south coast, as well as the North and South Thompson and Upper Columbia regions of the Interior, while both the emergency management and forests ministries warn the rain could complicate wildfire recovery in regions such as the Shuswap. Following a season of severe drought and wildfire, rainfall on impacted areas can generate high surface water runoff and erosion due to a lack of vegetation, leading to a possibility of localized flooding and landslides, the provinces statement says. It also says widespread or severe impacts are not expected as part of the latest atmospheric river system, but officials are urging all residents, no matter where they live, to take steps to prepare for seasonal storms. B.C.s worst atmospheric river hit the south coast and southern Interior on Nov. 14, 2021, bringing two days of intense precipitation that killed five people, cut all road and rail links with the rest of the province and Canada, and caused devastating landslides and floods in communities including Merritt, Princeton and Abbotsford.

Progress toward an agreementinprinciple has made on operational issues on the new Columbia River Treaty, after the 19th round of negotiations concluded in Portland Oct. 1213. The latest round of talks including negotiators representing Canada and the United States made progress on operational and other issues, noted a press release Wednesday from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation. The teams will continue to address compensation and bilateral treatyecosystem provisions in the coming weeks, it noted. If the agreementinprinciple is confirmed, the details of the agreement will be revealed, with the Province launching a conversation with Columbia Basin residents in B.C. and First Nations to explain the deal, as well as seeking feedback on it. Although 60 years of Assured Flood Control is set to expire in 2024, Canada and the U.S. have been in talks to modernize the historical transboundary agreement since May 2018, covering a range of topics over the course of 19 rounds of meetings. The key areas of interest are flood risk management, hydroelectric power and ecosystems, while Canada has also raised the issues of increasing coordination of Libby Dam operations and increasing flexibility for Canadian operations. The treaty which governs the timing and volume of water that passes through the Mica, Duncan and Hugh Keenleyside dams to prevent damaging floods and enhances hydroelectric power generation means Canada operates with reserved space in its treaty reservoirs to reduce flood risk in the United States, but it also has ramifications in Nelson and area. People in the West Kootenay witness these operations as water levels fluctuate along Arrow Lakes and Duncan reservoirs and Kootenay Lake, said Kathy Eichenberger, executive director of the provincial Columbia River Treaty team and B.C.s lead on the Canadian Columbia River Treaty negotiation delegation. While there are impacts associated with those fluctuations, the treaty has enabled local GHGfree power generation along the Kootenay Canal and mitigated flooding on Kootenay Lake and below the confluence of the Columbia and Kootenay rivers in Castlegar, Genelle and Trail. The treaty also manages water level at certain times of the year to target fish populations in both countries for whitefish and rainbow trout Canada and salmon U.S.. The discussions between the two countries will modernize the treaty in a way that could lead to a shift in when and how much water is released from the Canadian reservoirs to address ecosystem and support objectives for Indigenous cultural values and socioeconomic interests, but still provide flood risk management and power generation. When the treaty expires in 2024, if a new one is not struck to replace it that could trigger a more impromptu called upon regime, which would require the U.S. to make effective use of their reservoirs to manage flood risk, drafting them more deeply and frequently, before calling upon Canada for additional storage to prevent damaging floods. This is not ideal for the U.S. and also impacts B.C., said Eichenberger. The Canadian and U.S. negotiating teams are discussing different concepts for potentially providing some form of assured flood risk management that meets the needs of both countries, she said. Coordinated operations for power generation are also part of these discussions. On the Canadian side more flexibility is being sought in the treaty for domestic operations to meet Basin interests in areas such as ecosystem enhancement, Indigenous cultural values and socioeconomic objectives. Return of the salmon First Nations are asking for the return of the salmon to the entire Columbia River system as part of the Columbia River Treaty negotiations, including the upper portion of the Arrow Lakes, in order to reclaim their culture. In a Zoom meeting on May 16, 2022 for the Columbia River Treaty negotiations, Chief Keith Crow of the Smelqmix, Lower Similkameen Indian Band, called for greater consideration of salmon in the river system. The Columbia River Treaty has been one of the biggest infringements within our territories, infringement of the treaty that was never negotiated with us, he said. The benefits that Canada and B.C. have received from the treaty have been tremendous, Crow said, but at the expense of the salmon and First Nations cultural traditions. He pointed to the Columbia River salmon restoration initiative which started three years ago as an example of reversing that trend. I think it is another major piece to bringing the salmon back up the Columbia all the way into the Upper Arrow, he said, which is a goal of the Smelqmix Nation. Jay Johnston of the Penticton Indian Band agreed. Although the Columbia River Treaty was formed on two points energy production and flood control it has never considered the effect on First Nations. It left out not only many voices in the Columbia Basin and around the river, but it also left out the environment and the ecosystems and the cultural values that are so critically important to all of us, he said.

More than 150,000 square kilometres of land were burned, affecting both First Nations and nonFirst Nations communities alike. The assemblys member First Nations declared a climate emergency in July 2019, in recognition of how climate change was negatively affecting their lands, waters, animals and peoples.

Interior this past summer B.C. Wildfire Services The Assembly of First Nations launched its new national climate strategy in Ottawa on Wednesday, calling on federal, provincial, and territorial governments to work with First Nations to implement their climate priorities. Interim National Chief Joanna Bernard said this years recordbreaking wildfire season is a reason why all leaders should be taking climate change seriously, especially in First Nations communities. More than 150,000 square kilometres of land were burned, affecting both First Nations and nonFirst Nations communities alike. This is only the beginning, said Bernard, adding more extreme weather can be expected including fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, species migration and coastal sea level rise, among other challenges. In the face of this, Indigenous Peoples have taken matters into their own hands to try to find solutions, Bernard said. The assemblys member First Nations declared a climate emergency in July 2019, in recognition of how climate change was negatively affecting their lands, waters, animals and peoples. The declaration called for the development of a First Nationsled climate strategy, which the AFN unveiled on Parliament Hill on Wednesday. The strategy aims to incorporate Indigenous knowledge systems, rights and selfdetermination in cooperation with other governments, and seeks urgent and transformative climate action that includes First Nations solutions. But the road to introducing mitigation measures, rather than just reacting to climate disasters as they happen, could be a difficult one. A report from the federal auditor general last year found the federal government still hasnt provided First Nations with the support they need to respond to emergencies such as wildfires and floods, despite similar warnings almost a decade ago. The report concluded that the government was too reactive, and was failing to proactively spend on infrastructure that could mitigate damage when floods, fires and landslides strike. The auditor pointed out that as of April 2022, 112 such projects did not have funding despite meeting the criteria for eligibility, and 74 of them had been in the departments backlog for more than five years. Until these projects are completed, First Nations communities are likely to continue to experience emergencies that could be averted by investing in the right infrastructure, the report read. Based on the First Nations Infrastructure Funds annual budget of 12 million, it would take the department an estimated 24 years to fund the projects, the report added. As a result, First Nations communities are likely to continue to experience emergencies that could be prevented or mitigated by building the infrastructure. At the time, Indigenous Services Canada said it was reviewing its emergency management plans and working with First Nations to identify infrastructure gaps and work toward closing that gap in the long term.

Ma maison ne se trouvait pas dans la direction de la plage, mais je ne savais pas du tout o jtais.","Kagan McLeod Jai survcu linondation de mon appartement Christian Fleischmann, 33 ans Il tait 1h20, le matin du 15 juillet 2021. Je venais de me mettre au lit, lgrement ivre aprs avoir ft mon 31e anniversaire avec des copains, dans lappartement que joccupais au soussol de la maison de ma sur. Je vivais Sinzing, au sud de Bonn, en Allemagne, environ 500 m de la rivire Ahr. Il avait plu verse toute la semaine les autorits avaient mis un avertissement de crue et ordonn des vacuations, mais pas dans mon quartier. Par prcaution, javais empil des sacs de sable devant la porte qui donnait sur le jardin, et plac les vtements et les appareils lectroniques sur les tables et le canap, au cas o leau sinfiltrerait. Mes amis staient moqus de moi durant la soire, mais je ne voulais rien risquer. Je sombrais dans le sommeil quand jai t brusquement rveill par un bruit deau tumultueuse. En sortant du lit, jai atterri dans leau froide jusquaux genoux. Et elle montait vite Jai pens quune canalisation avait sans doute saut dans la salle de bain. Tremblant de froid, jai attrap mon tlphone et allum la lampe de poche. Il faisait nuit noire. Ce ntait pas la canalisation. Leau entrait par la porte du jardin. Les sacs de sable avaient vraisemblablement cd. Des tas dobjets flottaient dans le salon, des chaises, des tagres, une partie de ma batterie. Je commenais paniquer. La rivire Ahr, ce cours deau tranquille, au dbit habituellement si lent, tait violemment sortie de son lit. Il fallait que je sorte et vite Les effets de lalcool staient dissips la peur dgrise. Sous la pression de leau, la porte du jardin faisait un bruit de craquement dallumettes. a ne ressemblait rien que je connaissais, un mlange de crissements, de sifflements et de collisions. Implacable. Avec de leau qui me montait dsormais la taille, les pieds nus, le boxer coll la peau, jai avanc pniblement vers la seule sortie accessible la porte de lescalier qui conduisait au rezdechausse de la maison. Tout se brisait autour de moi les lampes volaient en clats, le frigo et les placards taient renverss. Jai pu tant bien que mal gagner la porte qui menait ltage, mais leau la tenait sous pression. Quand jarrivais lentrouvrir, la masse liquide la refermait aussitt. Jai cherch autour de moi un objet qui maurait permis de la caler et de la maintenir ouverte. Dans un coin, jai repr un balai, une pe trs lourde dniche dans une foire mdivale et un portemanteau. Je les ai mis en tas entre le cadre et la porte pour la maintenir suffisamment entrebille. Lpe ma sauv la mise. Je me suis gliss par les 30 cm douverture et jai pu enfin gagner lentre. La noirceur tait totale. Jai gravi lescalier jusquau deuxime o habitait ma sur. Mort dinquitude, jai tambourin sa porte et cri son nom avant de me rappeler quelle ne dormait pas la maison ce soirl. Revenu au rezdechausse mon autre sur y louait un bureau , je suis sorti. Immobile dans le noir, tremp et essouffl, je contemplais le paysage aquatique o flottaient des branches et des arbres. La rivire avait inond le quartier. Me calmant peu peu, jai pris conscience que, si javais tard de quelques minutes me rveiller, jy aurais laiss ma peau. On nous a assur que de tels vnements ne se produisent quune fois tous les 100 ans. Je lespre. Plus de 180 personnes sont mortes dans ces inondations, et certains villages de la rgion ont t balays. Aujourdhui, je vis chez mes parents au centreville et dors dans le bureau de mon pre. tudiant en psychologie, jenseigne les arts martiaux des coliers. Je ne pourrai jamais retourner vivre dans cet appartement parce que je suis hant par la peur que a ne se reproduise. Nous navions pas dassurance inondation, le quartier o se situait la maison ntant pas considr comme une zone risque. Nous nous chargeons donc des travaux nousmmes. La maison a t dvaste, comme bien dautres habitations voisines, y compris celle qui accueillait des personnes handicapes. Ctait horrible. Certains ne sen sont pas sortis. Quand mon ancien appartement sera sec et que les travaux seront finis, il accueillera une cole darts martiaux. Cette exprience aura eu du bon je suis plus reconnaissant et dtermin vivre intensment chaque jour de ma vie. Jai failli me noyer et je retiens les paroles que ma mre a prononces par la suite Christian, il ne faut pas se souvenir du jour o tu as tout perdu, mais de celui o tu as survcu. Dcouvrez ensuite cette histoire dune jeune femme qui a t emporte par la rivire Niagara Kagan McLeod Jai survcu au dysfonctionnement de mon parachute Jordan Hatmaker, 36 ans Le 14 novembre 2021 tait une journe idale pour le parachutisme ensoleille avec trs peu de vent. Jtais encore novice avec seulement 14 sauts mon actif trop peu pour obtenir la licence. Javais peur, bien sr, mais on affronte mieux le risque avec un peu de peur, non Cest cela qui mavait sduit dans ce sport. Jai toujours fait dans lexcs. Le hangar tait 40 minutes en voiture de chez moi. la priphrie de Suffolk, dans le sudouest de la Virginie, il y avait tout lespace arien et les terres non habites dont on pouvait rver. Je suis mont bord de lavion avec 15 autres parachutistes pour un premier saut 13h30. Le temps tait superbe. Javais repass avec mon instructrice toutes les consignes de scurit un rituel reprendre avant chaque saut, quelle que soit lexprience du parachutiste. Il faut notamment pointer depuis la porte de lavion la zone de saut lendroit o vous prvoyez atterrir 4100 m, pour diriger le saut. Nous avons saut, moi dabord, puis mon instructrice, plongeant en chute libre quelque 200 km lheure, soit 300 m en 5 secondes. Cest une sensation exaltante et terrifiante la fois, avec le monde qui souvre sous nos yeux. Jtais port par le vent et, environ 1200 m du sol, jai dploy lextracteur un petit parachute utilis pour lextraction de la voile principale. Une fois libr, le grand parachute sest gonfl dair, et je disposais denviron une minute pour profiter de la quitude en me balanant doucement vers lherbe du sol. Je me sentais invincible. Nous sommes vite repartis pour un deuxime saut. Le groupe de parachutistes discutait et plaisantait dans lavion. Ctait gnial. Jai rpt la mme scne avec linstructrice, puis nous avons saut. Aprs 30 secondes, environ 1680 m, nous nous sommes loigns lun de lautre pour que nos parachutes puissent se dployer sans obstacle. Jai jet un coup dil sur laltimtre et me je suis rendu compte que jtais plus bas que je ne croyais. Le sol arrivait une vitesse vertigineuse Je savais quil fallait librer lextracteur environ 1200 m, comme la dernire fois, mais, pris au dpourvu et press, je nai pas pris le temps de stabiliser ma position. Quand jai tir lextracteur, au lieu quil se relche dans la colonne dair pour se gonfler, il sest enroul autour de ma jambe droite en la tirant vers le haut je ressemblais une ballerine. Le parachute principal restait dans son sac. Il suffit que je me dgage, aije song calmement. Jai perdu 7 secondes essayer de me dmler, en vain. Jaurais mieux fait de dployer immdiatement le parachute de rserve. Je distinguais de plus en plus nettement le sol et me prparais au choc. tonnamment, je ne mattendais pas un impact catastrophique. Je men tirerais avec une fracture de la jambe, tout au plus. Jai toujours t optimiste. Soudain, le parachute de rserve automatique qui se dploie quand le principal ne fonctionne pas sest ouvert. Jai regagn une certaine matrise avant de viser les herbes en esprant que latterrissage y serait plus doux. Mon soulagement a t de courte dure. Quelques secondes plus tard, le parachute principal sortait enfin de son sac et se gonflait. Entres en concurrence, les deux voiles se sont mises tirer chacune de son ct, ce qui a violemment prcipit ma chute au sol, non loin de la zone de saut. En mcrasant, jai senti une brlure vive sur tout le corps. Jai essay de me relever cest ce quil faut faire quand on natterrit pas sur ses pieds pour montrer que a allait. Jen tais incapable. Mes membres infrieurs taient figs. Le visage dans lherbe, les bras en croix, jai hurl laide Au secours Entre chaque appel, je priais haute voix Piti, mon Dieu. Faites que je ne sois pas paralys Je suis rest ainsi 5 minutes, le visage enfoui dans lherbe. Puis les gens du club de parachutisme sont arrivs. Ils mont entour, dsireux daider, mais ne pouvaient rien faire. Me bouger aurait t trop risqu, ce que je nai pas compris tout de suite. Je les ai donc accabls dinjures et dappels laide mesure que ltat de choc se dissipait et que la douleur sinstallait. Lambulance est arrive une demiheure plus tard la douleur tait telle quil a t impossible de me mettre sur une civire pour le transport. Je hurlais. Puis jai entendu lhlicoptre. son arrive, lquipe mdicale de lambulance arienne ma administr de la ktamine qui ma envoy au pays des rves, puis jai t transport au centre de trauma le plus proche. Les blessures se sont rvles assez graves une cheville clate, une fracture du tibia et une lsion de la colonne vertbrale responsable dune fuite de liquide rachidien. Personne ne pouvait assurer que je marcherais de nouveau un jour, mais jtais dtermin et, en fvrier 2022, trois mois aprs laccident, je faisais mes premiers pas. Jai entrepris un programme de physiothrapie soutenu qui se poursuit encore aujourdhui. En novembre 2022, alors que jtais incapable de soulever les jambes aprs laccident, je grimpais jusquau camp de base de lEverest. Je prvois reprendre le saut en parachute mais je nai encore rien dit mes parents. Cette histoire datterrissage haut risque, o un pilote davion sest vanoui, laissant au passager lobligation de diriger lavion, est toute aussi terrifiante Kagan McLeod Jai survcu une tornade de neige , coince dans ma voiture Shannon St. Onge, 38 ans La tempte devait dbuter en soire, le lundi 31 janvier 2022. Je travaillais la maison, mais javais prvu me rendre au bureau luniversit canadienne des Premires Nations, Regina, pour signer le chque dune bourse durgence accorde un tudiant. tant directrice des finances, je souhaitais lui faire parvenir cet argent le plus vite possible, tempte ou pas. Je ntais pas inquite. Javais amplement le temps de faire lallerretour. Jai roul 30 minutes sur la Transcanadienne vers lest. Ds mon arrive, mon collgue sest point pour signer lui aussi le chque et il a aussitt quitt luniversit. Jallais partir mon tour quand jai remarqu le sac dordinateur quil avait oubli dans mon bureau. Zut, je suis dj la maison, atil soupir quand je lai appel. Je te lapporte si tu veux. Il tait un peu pass 16h30. La neige ntait pas prvue avant le dbut de la soire, mais par mesure de prudence, jai prfr prendre les petites routes plutt que lautoroute qui risquait de se transformer rapidement en patinoire. Avant darriver chez lui, jai fait un plein et achet deux pizzas en prvision du souper, comme je my tais engage auprs de ma fille de 15 ans et de mon fils de 10 ans. Le trajet jusque chez mon collgue a pris une quinzaine de minutes. Je lui ai laiss le sac et jai repris la route aussitt. Il a commenc neiger et les flocons tombaient, abondants. En quelques minutes, tout tait blanc. Jtais au milieu dune tornade de neige, ou ce que les mtorologues la tl appellent un hurleur de la Saskatchewan, une tempte qui sabat vite avec des vents si violents quelle hurle. Ctait terrifiant Engage sur une route de gravier, jtais force de ralentir. Jai baiss la vitre pour suivre le bord de la chausse afin de ne pas dvier. En ralit, je ne savais pas de quel ct je roulais. Craignant de me retrouver dans le champ, le foss ou quoi encore, jai fini par marrter, sans couper le contact pour rester au chaud, et appeler les secours. On ma recommand de ne pas bouger et dattendre le lendemain personne ne viendrait me chercher avant le matin, au plus tt. Les quelques secondes qui ont suivi ont t les pires de mon existence. Il tait exclu de sortir dans cet univers de blanc o tout est invisible, avec des vents puissants et une temprature frlant les 10C. Et puis je ne savais pas o jtais et javais peur que les automobilistes, faute de me voir, ne foncent dans ma voiture. Ou que la neige ne bouche le pot dchappement et que je meure intoxique par le monoxyde de carbone. Et si la tempte durait plus longtemps que prvu et quon me retrouvait trop tard Respire, inutile de paniquer, me suisje dit. Mes enfants Ils passeraient une premire nuit la maison sans moi. Jai appel pour les prvenir, me forant garder un ton calme. Je ne leur ai pas dit que jtais terrifie. Il tait prs de 18h et il faisait nuit. Comment les secours arriveraientils trouver mon VUS Ford Edge noir dans toute cette neige Verraientils seulement une ombre Un camion est pass, vitant de peu la voiture. Je lavais chapp belle. Jai dabord eu peur, puis je me suis dit que jtais sauve. Jai embray pour le suivre, dsespre, rou lant lentement, nayant aucune ide o il allait. Quand le camion a bifurqu un carrefour, je suis reste dsempare. Je vais la plage, atil cri par la vitre baisse, les paroles emportes par le vent. Ma maison ne se trouvait pas dans la direction de la plage, mais je ne savais pas du tout o jtais. Jai arrt la voi ture pour envoyer un texto au collgue qui javais rapport le sac. Jai plaisant sur cette bonne action se terminant par une catastrophe. Il a eu une ide. Dtermine ta position sur Google Maps et envoiemoi le rsultat. Je me suis excute et quelques minutes plus tard, il me renvoyait une capture dcran de la vue satellite du lieu o je me trouvais. Il sagissait vraisemblablement de Bouvier Lane, une petite route qui reliait deux fermes. Il tait 18h30. Jai post cette information sur mon compte Facebook en priant que quelquun connaisse au moins une personne qui pourrait venir mon secours. Il ny avait plus qu attendre sagement dans la voiture en tchant de rester au chaud. Jtais contente davoir fait le plein. Javais pris les bonnes dcisions et, quoi quil arrive, je ne pouvais pas men vouloir. Mais mme si on savait o je me trouvais, comment avancer dans cette neige tourbillonnante souffle par des vents hurlants Les ractions ma publication sur Facebook ont t rapides. Des gens connaissaient une famille qui vivait par l Jai reu le message dune personne qui allait me mettre en relation avec elle. 20h, mon tlphone a sonn. Ctait le fils du fermier propritaire de la terre qui longeait la route o je mtais arrte. Son pre viendrait me chercher Quarantecinq minutes plus tard, jai vu un homme assez grand vtu dun impermable jaune avanant dans ma direction dans le noir, une lampe torche la main. Quel soulagement Andr Bouvier avait parcouru 500 m dans le blizzard pour venir mon secours, luttant pas pas contre le vent et la neige, se protgeant les yeux de la morsure des flocons de sa main recouverte dune mitaine. Vous prenez le volant aije demand dune voix chevrotante travers la vitre. Je suis trop nerveuse. Malgr sa dmarche puissante, le voyant maintenant de prs, jai compris quil sagissait dun vieil homme. Non, atil rpondu dune voix calme. Vous me suivrez en voiture. Tout ira bien. Il a commenc avancer pniblement dans la neige, sr de sa direction. Je roulais lentement derrire lui, les mains cramponnes au volant, sentant les battements de mon cur sapaiser. Nous sommes arrivs chez lui en quelques minutes. En sortant de la voiture, jai clat en sanglots, la peur cdant au soulagement et la gratitude. Pendant que sa femme me servait une boisson chaude et une compote de pommes, Andr je venais dapprendre quil avait 80 ans est ressorti dans la tempte. Il avait vu deux autres voitures bloques et allait les aider leur tour un pre et ses deux enfants et un couple avec leur fille. Nous avons pass la nuit raconter des histoires, les enfants ont mang les pizzas que javais achetes et nous avons dormi dans la maison, qui sur les canaps, qui dans les fauteuils bascule. 5h30, le lendemain, Andr avait dgag la neige devant chez lui pour nous permettre de reprendre la route et de rentrer la maison. Jtais finalement 5 minutes en voiture, mais je ne men tais pas rendu compte la veille. Mme si je lavais su, jaurais risqu ma vie en poursuivant ma route. Cette exprience a transform ma vision de lexistence. Elle ma appris accueillir plus calmement les dfis et les retournements de situation. Elle a aussi renforc ce sentiment quil faut, quand cest possible, tendre la main vers les autres et les aider, les amis comme les trangers. Je suis toujours en relation avec Andr. Nous sommes amis pour la vie Pour son dvouement exceptionnel et son sens du civisme ce soirl, Andr Bouvier sest vu dcerner une mdaille du jubil de platine de la reine Elizabeth II.

Rainfall warnings across Vancouver Island and the inner South Coast have lifted for the most part, but flood watches posted by the B.C. River Forecast Centre across western Vancouver Island and for the Englishman River near Parksville warn of levels seen only once every 10 years on some waterways. High streamflow advisories and the risk of local flooding cover the rest of Vancouver Island, most of the inner south coast north of Vancouver, and the Interior regions of the Upper Columbia, North and South Thompson. Environment Canada says the mild, subtropical surge of moisture that created B.C.s latest atmospheric river Tuesday and Wednesday has mostly passed, with rain still falling throughout Thursday. According to the agency, the storm had dumped 233 millimetres of rain at the Kennedy Lake forestry station east of Ucluelet by late Wednesday and at least 172 millimetres at the Tofino airport, while parts of Metro Vancouver received up to 100 millimetres. The accumulations mark the heaviest downpours across the South Coast in almost a year. Environment Canada records show the greatest deluge before that was during the atmospheric river in November 2021, which caused devastating flooding, washouts, and landslides from Metro Vancouver to the southern Interior. Drought levels drop in some areas Meanwhile, the rain has also helped add some muchneeded moisture to some areas of the province. The West Vancouver Island Basin has now dropped to Drought Level 1 the second lowest on the sixlevel scale where adverse impacts are rare. The east island basin is now at Drought Level 2, which the province says means adverse impacts are unlikely. The Lower Mainland, meanwhile, has also dropped to Drought Level 2. While there have been some improvements in parts of B.C., the northeast continues to see dry conditions, with a number of areas still classified as Drought Level 4 or 5, meaning adverse impacts are likely or almost certain. Those levels are the highest on the scale.",1

Scientists from NASA Ames Research Center, the University of Arizona, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, and the University of Florida are also coauthors on the paper. Figurea Map of Hydraotes Chaos showing how the interpreted mud volcanoes orange dots and diapirs white dots are widespread. Both feature types result from sedimentary volcanism instead of magma upwells and eruptions, wet sediments, and salts reach and breach the surface, forming mounds and flows. Interestingly, these mounds only occur over the chaotic terrain floor materials and not on the mesas redshaded areas they embay. This suggests a material composition link rather than a genesis by regional extensional forces generated by magmatic rises. Figure b shows a possible mud volcano.

The extensive study of Martian aquifer drainage has revealed enormous flood channels that stretch thousands of kilometers into the planets northern lowlands. The prodigious erosion caused by these channels, combined with the subsurface sediments released from the aquifers, blankets extensive portions of the northern lowlands. This complex landscape presents a formidable challenge for the investigation of the nature of the Martian aquifers. Venturing into the northern plains for sampling could prove precarious, as distinguishing between materials sourced from the aquifers and those eroded and transported during channel formation could become an intricate task. The plains, situated within Hydraotes Chaos, offer a unique glimpse into ancient aquifer materials. These plains, which we think formed from mud extruding into a basin directly above their source aquifer, provide a more targeted exploration opportunity, Rodriguez said. Unlike vast flood channels with their complex erosion patterns, this finding simplifies the examination of Martian aquifers, reducing the risk of overland sedimentary acquisition, and opens a new window into Mars geological past. Our numerical models reveal a fascinating story. The lakes source aquifer likely originated from ice, water and mineral separation within the mudstone, forming vast waterfilled chambers, several kilometers wide and hundreds of meters deep. This process was likely triggered by intrusive igneous activity. Moreover, the observed segmented subsidence across the chaotic terrain suggests an interconnected network of chambers, depicting stable waterfilled giant caverns, some reaching kilometers in widths and lengths, way larger than any known Earth counterparts, coauthor Travis said. Initially biomolecules could have been dispersed throughout the volume of large groundwater filled cavities. As the water was released to the surface and ponded, the water went away leaving behind layers of sediments and potentially high concentrations of biomolecules, Rodriguez said. Therefore, the residue of this ancient mud lake could provide unprecedented access to aquifer materials enriched in biomolecules that have remained hidden within Mars subsurface for most of its existence. NASA Ames is considering the plains as a possible landing site for a mission to search for evidence of biomarkers, specifically lipids. These biomolecules are extremely resistant and could have endured billions of years on Mars, coauthor Mary Beth Wilhelm, an astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center, said. The study region includes widespread mud volcanoes and other mud upwellings. The mud could provide new windows into subsurface environments, which once were moist and maybe even habitable. Signatures of life and its habitats could include freezedried remnants of microbes in the upwelled mud, and the mud would contain minerals indicative of the temperature and composition of subsurface water. A small rover, if directed to that potential landing site, could detect these clues in the erupted mud., coauthor Kargel said. Our crater counts indicate that the plains are relatively recent, returning an age of 1 billion years. This age is good news for our search for life. This age is way younger than the ages of most aquifer releases on Mars, dating back to approximately 3.4 billion years ago. So, the materials spent a huge amount of time in the subsurface, coauthor Berman said. lobate margin forming part of a constant elevation contact, which we interpret as the lakes inundation periphery.

The B.C. River Forecast Centre has posted flood watches across western Vancouver Island and for the Englishman River near Parksville, warning of levels seen only once every 10 years on some waterways. High streamflow advisories and the risk of local flooding cover the rest of Vancouver Island, most of the inner south coast north of Vancouver and the Interior regions of the Upper Columbia, North and South Thompson. Environment Canada says a mild, subtropical surge of moisture created B.C.s latest atmospheric river Tuesday and Wednesday. A publicsafety warning about high water continues on the Puntledge River, which flows through Courtenay, after B.C. Hydro released water from the Comox dam. The warning will be in effect until Tuesday, said Hydro spokesperson Stephen Watson. The release of water is being done to lower the level of the reservoir behind the dam and keep it from overflowing due to recent rainy conditions, he said. When we increase the water flows from our spillway gates, we issue an advisory. The Comox dam is one of four systems that Hydro operates on the Island to produce power, Watson said, with the other power stations on the Campbell River system, the Ash River system in the Alberni Valley and the Jordan River system. He said the recent rain has been good for waterways like Campbell River. Watson said that system received the equivalent of an Olympicsized swimming pool every five seconds during the height of the stormy weather. So its good for power generation, its good for salmon. The weather office says the storm had dumped 233 millimetres of rain at the Kennedy Lake forestry station east of Ucluelet by late Wednesday and at least 172 millimetres at the Tofino airport, while parts of Metro Vancouver received up to 100 millimetres. The accumulations mark the heaviest downpours across the south coast in almost a year.

A muchloved Vancouver restaurant has been fined 7,000 after being caught serving a minor in a Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch sting. Popular West Broadway sushi restaurant The Excellent Eatery was visited at random by two branch agents March 26. With them was a minor agent under 19. The minor entered the Eatery first and was seated at a table. The inspectors followed and were given their choice of tables, selecting the one next to the minor. The inspectors had a clear line of sight of the minor agent at all times. A server gave the minor cutlery and took their order for a beer. When the beer was delivered, the minor left followed by the inspectors, case adjudicator Dianne Flood said in the newly release Sept. 18 decision. At no time was the minor agent asked to produce identification, nor could she have provided any as her own identification was being held by the inspectors, Flood said. An inspector then informed a staff member of the alleged contravention and took a photo of the beer. The licensee does not dispute that the server did not ask for identification and sold liquor to a minor but claims a defence of due diligence, Flood said. Flood said the Eaterys policy is to request identification from anyone ordering liquor who appears to be under 30. She said the restaurant comanagers hold staff meetings about every three or four months and topics always include liquor service. The server was told not to come in for two weeks after the incident. The branch noted the restaurant had training deficiencies, including a lack of a written policy manual to be provided to staff, a written checklist and tests. The lack of an incident log was also called a failure. The eatery told Flood training includes information about the harms to minors of the consumption of liquor, and that new servers are given very clear instructions to identify anyone who looks to be under 30. It said a manual, while not provided to staff, is used as guide in the training. The eatery said they ensure new servers have read and understood the Serving it Right guide and that the guide is pinned on the operations Slack for easy access. Flood found The Excellent Eatery had gaps in its policy system and that an outdated policy manual was not given to employees. She said testing of employees would assist in employee training. I have identified a number of areas where I find the licensees training and systems in relation to prohibiting the sale of liquor to minors are not adequate, Flood said. On that basis, I conclude the licensee has failed to establish the defence of due diligence at the time of the contravention of the sale of liquor to a minor and find imposition of a penalty is warranted. Flood said the licensee has a long history without branch or police warnings.",1

The B.C. River Forecast Centre posted flood watches across western Vancouver Island and for the Englishman River near Parksville, warning of levels seen only once every 10 years on some waterways. High streamflow advisories and the risk of local flooding cover the rest of Vancouver Island, most of the inner south coast north of Vancouver and the Interior regions of the Upper Columbia, North and South Thompson. Environment Canada says the mild, subtropical surge of moisture that created B.C.s latest atmospheric river Tuesday and Wednesday had mostly passed, but forecasters expected showers to linger through the day. The weather office says the storm had dumped 233 millimetres of rain at the Kennedy Lake forestry station east of Ucluelet by late Wednesday and at least 172 millimetres at the Tofino airport, while parts of Metro Vancouver received up to 100 millimetres. The accumulations mark the heaviest downpours across the south coast in almost a year and Environment Canada records show the greatest deluge before that was during the atmospheric river in November 2021 that caused devastating flooding, washouts and landslides from Metro Vancouver to the southern Interior.

Three deaths in the U.K. were blamed on the bad weather. The winds are expected to hit hardest in the eastern part of Denmarks Jutland peninsula and the Danish islands in the Baltic Sea. But the northern part of the British Isles, southern Sweden and Norway, and northern Germany are also in the path of the storm, named Babet by U.K.s weather forecaster, the Met Office. Eastern Scotland continued to bear the brunt of the stormy weather. On Friday, the Met Office issued a new red warning, its highest, for parts of the region through Saturday. This is not usual autumn weather, said Andy Page, the Mets chief meteorologist. This is an exceptional event, and we are likely to continue to see significant impacts with the potential for further flooding and damage to properties. On Friday, police reported that a man in his 60s died after getting caught in fastflowing flood water in the central England county of Shropshire. In Scotland, a 57yearold woman died Thursday after being swept into a river in the region of Angus, where hundreds of homes were also evacuated. Also on Thursday, a 56yearold man died after his van hit a falling tree in the same area. Though forecasters said the worst of the heavy rain in Scotland had passed, they warned that conditions will remain difficult, with river levels still on the rise and flood defenses breached. Some parts of the town of Brechin are only accessible by boat after its flood defenses were overwhelmed by the heavy rainfall, raising concerns about further loss of life. I cannot stress how dangerous conditions are in Brechin in particular, said Scotlands first minister, Humza Yousaf. Wind gusts in excess of 60 mph 100 kph were likely on Friday. Several major road sections and rail routes were closed in Scotland, while air passengers were facing flight cancellations. The storm has already brought more than a months worth of rain in the worstaffected regions in Scotland and was pummeling many parts of England on Friday. At Leeds Bradford Airport, a flight arriving from the Greek island of Corfu skidded off the runway while landing in windy conditions. There were no reported injuries and ensuing arrivals were diverted to other airports. We are working with the airline, relevant operations teams and emergency authorities to address this situation and remove passengers from the aircraft safely, a spokesperson for the airport said. In northeastern England, a lighthouse at the mouth of the River Tyne lost its distinctive red and white dome. Port of Tyne officials said it was not yet safe to assess the damage to the South Shields lighthouse while weather conditions remained dangerous. The swirling weather system was also hitting other parts of Northern Europe, particularly Denmark. The Danish Meteorological Institute wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it expects water levels to exceed the 100year event in several places. Police in southern Denmark the Danish region expected to be the worst hit said a number of sections of road in lowlying areas were flooded and some trees had fallen. Police said a dike was breached and urged people to immediately leave Sandersvig Strand on the Jutland peninsula. Danish meteorologists issued their highest warning for very dangerous weather and said levels of some inland waters were expected to rise up to 240 centimeters nearly eight feet above normal. In neighboring Sweden, meteorologists warned of the risk of extensive flooding which may cause limited access on roads and railways along the southern coasts of the Scandinavian country. Water levels were expected to begin dropping again on Saturday morning, Swedish meteorologists said. A bridge near Norways secondlargest city was protectively closed, the Bergens Tidende newspaper said. Ferries across the region were canceled and air traffic was hampered, with delays and a few cancellations. The Swedish Transportation Authority suspended service of several train and bus lines in southern Sweden, because of the weather, prompting Skanetrafiken, the operator of the local transit system, to recommend avoiding travel on public transport. Some regional bus routes will be canceled and there is a risk that both regional and replacement buses in service may also be canceled at short notice, Skanetrafiken said on its website. In Germany, some streets and squares were flooded in the cities of Flensburg, Kiel and Wismar on the Baltic coast. Fallen trees caused some disruption, including a railway line. Ferry operator Scandlines suspended services on its RoedbyPuttgarden and GedserRostock routes between Denmark and Germany. On Germanys North Sea coast, the high winds had the opposite effect to the flooding on the Baltic coast, pushing the water further out and leading to very low water levels. Ferries to some North Sea islands were canceled. Pylas reported from London. Associated Press writer Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.

Norma had weakened and was downgraded to Category 1 on the hurricane wind scale. It was located 25 miles west of Cabo San Lucas storm with winds of 85 mph 140 kmh and expected to make landfall on Saturday, according to the U.S. AP PhotoFernando Llano Original Publication Date October 20, 2023 916 PM CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico AP Hurricane Norma came ashore near the resorts of Los Cabos at the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula on Saturday afternoon, and hours later Hurricane Tammy made landfall on the Caribbean island of Barbuda. Both storms were Category 1 hurricanes when they hit. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Norma, once a Category 4 hurricane, moved ashore with winds of 80 mph 130 kph near el Pozo de Cota, westnorthwest of Cabo San Lucas. Norma later weakened to a tropical storm with 70 mph 110 kph winds as it crossed the Baja California Peninsula and by late Saturday it was nearing the Sea of Cortez, also known as the Gulf of California. Businesses in Cabo San Lucas had nailed plywood over their windows, and government personnel hung banners warning people not to try to cross gullies and stream beds after Norma regained strength and again became a major storm Friday. Norma was centered about 45 miles 70 kilometers northnortheast of Cabo San Lucas late Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving northnortheast at 6 mph 9 kph, but was expected to take a harder turn toward the east Sunday. President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador said via the platform X that there had so been no reported loss of life from the storm. Hurricane Norma already passed Los Cabos and there are only torrential rains in La Paz, but without loss of life. In Cabo San Lucas, curious tourists began to pick their way along debrisstrewn beaches after the storm passed. The effects of the storm were still being felt after night fell, and authorities urged people to stay at home. There were still families in shelters in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, though officials did not say how many. Around 200 people were in shelters in La Paz. Its languid pace raised the possibility of severe flooding. Norma was expected to dump six to 12 inches of rain, with a maximum of 18 inches in places across southern Baja California and much of Sinaloa state. John Cangialosi, a senior specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said the area is vulnerable to rain because it is a dry region generally. Six to 12 inches of rain is what is generally forecast, but there could be pockets of up to 18 inches of rain and we do think that will be the most significant impact that could result in flash and urban flooding and mudslides, he said. Baja California Sur Gov. Victor Castro said via the platform X that because its moving slowly, greater damages are anticipated. But little damage was initially reported. Some trees and power poles were down, but there were no reports of injuries. Police in San Jose del Cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early Saturday. Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. Some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations. By late morning, the areas streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about threequarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. The local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. Airports were closed. San Jose del Cabo airport director Francisco Villaseor said he expected flights to resume by midday Sunday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tammy came ashore Saturday night with 85 mph 140 kph winds. The hurricane was moving northnorthwest at 10 mph 17 kph and by late Saturday was centered 15 miles 25 kilometers northnorthwest of Barbuda. Hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelmy. The warning was lifted for Antigua. The hurricane center said that heavy rainfall and flooding are likely over much of the Lesser Antilles. Tammy hit two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe swept by Antigua and Barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. The slowmoving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation, where the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Philippes recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. This means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said in a nationwide broadcast Friday. He urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. Government offices, banks and most nonretail businesses closed early on Friday to allow staff to prepare. Residents rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout St Johns and near popular shopping centers and supermarkets. Local disaster management officials announced plans to open about 40 shelters in communities throughout the country.

CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico AP Hurricane Norma came ashore near the resorts of Los Cabos at the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula on Saturday afternoon, and hours later Hurricane Tammy made landfall on the Caribbean island of Barbuda. Both storms were Category 1 hurricanes when they hit. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Norma, once a Category 4 hurricane, moved ashore with winds of 80 mph 130 kph near el Pozo de Cota, westnorthwest of Cabo San Lucas. Norma later weakened to a tropical storm with 70 mph 110 kph winds as it crossed the Baja California Peninsula and by late Saturday it was nearing the Sea of Cortez, also known as the Gulf of California. Businesses in Cabo San Lucas had nailed plywood over their windows, and government personnel hung banners warning people not to try to cross gullies and stream beds after Norma regained strength and again became a major storm Friday. Norma was centered about 45 miles 70 kilometers northnortheast of Cabo San Lucas late Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving northnortheast at 6 mph 9 kph, but was expected to take a harder turn toward the east Sunday. President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador said via the platform X that there had so been no reported loss of life from the storm. Hurricane Norma already passed Los Cabos and there are only torrential rains in La Paz, but without loss of life. In Cabo San Lucas, curious tourists began to pick their way along debrisstrewn beaches after the storm passed. The effects of the storm were still being felt after night fell, and authorities urged people to stay at home. There were still families in shelters in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, though officials did not say how many. Around 200 people were in shelters in La Paz. Its languid pace raised the possibility of severe flooding. Norma was expected to dump six to 12 inches of rain, with a maximum of 18 inches in places across southern Baja California and much of Sinaloa state. John Cangialosi, a senior specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said the area is vulnerable to rain because it is a dry region generally. Six to 12 inches of rain is what is generally forecast, but there could be pockets of up to 18 inches of rain and we do think that will be the most significant impact that could result in flash and urban flooding and mudslides, he said. Baja California Sur Gov. Victor Castro said via the platform X that because its moving slowly, greater damages are anticipated. But little damage was initially reported. Some trees and power poles were down, but there were no reports of injuries. Police in San Jose del Cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early Saturday. Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. Some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations. By late morning, the areas streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about threequarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. The local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. Airports were closed. San Jose del Cabo airport director Francisco Villaseor said he expected flights to resume by midday Sunday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tammy came ashore Saturday night with 85 mph 140 kph winds. The hurricane was moving northnorthwest at 10 mph 17 kph and by late Saturday was centered 15 miles 25 kilometers northnorthwest of Barbuda. Hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelmy. The warning was lifted for Antigua. The hurricane center said that heavy rainfall and flooding are likely over much of the Lesser Antilles. Tammy hit two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe swept by Antigua and Barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. The slowmoving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation, where the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Philippes recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. This means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said in a nationwide broadcast Friday. He urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. Government offices, banks and most nonretail businesses closed early on Friday to allow staff to prepare. Residents rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout St Johns and near popular shopping centers and supermarkets.

APs earlier story follows below. CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico AP Residents of Mexicos Los Cabos resorts rushed to prepare as Hurricane Norma headed toward the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula for an expected landfall Saturday, while in the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy threatened to batter the islands of the Lesser Antilles. Businesses in Cabo San Lucas nailed up sheets of plywood over their windows, and government personnel hung up banners warning people not to try to cross gullies and stream beds after Norma regained strength and once again became a major storm Friday. By early Saturday, Norma had weakened and was downgraded to Category 1 on the hurricane wind scale. It was located just offshore 25 miles west of Cabo San Lucas storm with winds of 85 mph 140 kmh and moving north at 8 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The hurricane was expected to continue on that path through the evening before turning to the northeast and slowing down through Monday. The forecast track would take a weakened Norma toward the mainland of Mexicos western Pacific coast as a tropical storm. Its languid pace raised the possibility of severe flooding. Norma was expected to dump six to 12 inches of rain with a maximum of 18 inches in places across southern Baja California and much of Sinaloa state. According to the state civil protection agency, shelters in Baja California Sur housed some 1,500 people by Saturday morning. The Los Cabos Civil Defense agency urged residents to stay indoors all day as winds and rain increased. Emergency workers rushed around the area evacuating people from lowlying areas and moving them to shelters. Police in San Jose del Cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early Saturday. Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were already isolated by rising water. Some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. By late morning, the areas streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said hurricane conditions were already occurring over southern parts of the peninsula. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about threequarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, Baja California Sur state tourism secretary Maribel Collins said. There was no way out anyway Airports were closed Saturday, according to the local civil defense office. The local hotel association estimated there were about 40,000 tourists still in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. At the marina in Cabo San Lucas, Jos Cesea was hauling out of the water the boat he usually uses to ferry tourists around on tours. With the port closed to navigation and a hurricane coming, he said it wasnt worth risking his craft. Homero Blanco, the state commander of the National Guard, said beaches at the resort had been ordered closed and Guard troops were sent to clear people from the seashore. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations, and municipal officials said as many as 39 emergency shelters could be opened, if needed. In the Atlantic, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Tammy had winds of 85 mph 140 kph, and hurricane warnings were issued for the islands of Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Tammy was moving northwest at 8 mph 13 kmh. In the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy was about 25 miles 40 kilometers northnortheast of Guadeloupe and 50 miles 80 kilometers southeast of the Caribbean island of Antigua. Tammy was expected to remain at hurricane strength and even strengthen slightly as it moved toward the Lesser Antilles through Saturday passing by Guadeloupe, Antigua and Barbuda. Both Martinique and Guadeloupe are French overseas departments. The hurricane center said in a report that heavy rainfall and flooding are likely over much of the Lesser Antilles. Two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe rolled through Antigua and Barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness, residents of the islands braced for Tammys arrival.

Parodying 37 of Shakespeares plays in a comically shortened format, Timothy Murphy, Marc Beaudette, and AJ Brisson will take on 150 characters from the playwrights most famous comedies, histories, and tragedies. If you love Shakespeare, youll love the show if you hate Shakespeare, youll love the show, Beaudette told SooToday. It really is for everybody and its a laugh a minute for two hours. All the histories are done like a sporting event, they lump all of his comedies together in five minutes, and they do one of his obscure plays as a cooking show, he adds. Directed by Sandra Forsell, the play was last performed by Sault Theatre Workshop in 2006 according to Beaudette, but he says some of the content has since changed to keep up with changing times. They keep revising it to keep it more topical, so a lot has been added to it since the 2006 show, he explains. Some of the jokes and references are updated to the current times as well. No night is the same as the next either, he adds. Theres a lot of improvisation and audience participation in the show. There will be different things each night based on audience reaction and things that we as actors will find on different nights as well. The Algoma Repertory Theatre team is hoping the Shakespearean show can carry over the dinner theatre momentum from their successful production of Tony n Tinas Wedding last April. With hundreds of shows combined between the experienced cast of three, Beaudette says this production is unlike any other theyve ever rehearsed for. Its the funniest show Ive ever rehearsed, he says. The process has been so much fun, and the three of us are working so well together. Each one of us brings a different skillset to the table, and weve gelled together to make this a really tight show. While evoking laughter is his top priority, Beaudette says he also hopes the play serves as an opportunity to help keep Shakespeares works alive. This is definitely a great springboard into Shakespeare or getting back into Shakespeare, he says. For people who have been interested in his shows in the past, their memories will be triggered by this. There are moments where the language can get a little complex, he adds. Several times the actors kind of just look at the audience and go I dont know what it means either. So, they do make light of it. Performances run from Nov. 811 at the Quattro Hotel and Conference Centre. Dinner will be family style with roast chicken, Italian seasoned potatoes, penne, and homemade red sauce, along with mixed greens, green beans and fresh bread. Its such a great venue the ballroom is such a great space, Beaudette says. Were going to be limiting tickets to 200 a night, but there really isnt a bad seat in the house. Its such a good setup for dinner theatre. Doors open at 6 p.m., dinner will be served at 630 p.m., and the show begins at 8 p.m. Tickets are available by calling Marc Beaudette at 705 9439519 or by clicking here. For attendees who dont want the dinner experience, minimal showonly seats will be available starting Nov. 1.",1

The storm brought disruption across the U.K., with several main roads and rail lines shut by flooding.","COPENHAGEN, Denmark AP A storm battered Britain, northern Germany and southern Scandinavia early Saturday, for a third day, with powerful winds, heavy rain and storm surges that caused floods, power outages, evacuations and disrupted flights, railway service and ferry lines. Since Thursday, at least four people have died in the storm, named Babet by the UK Meteorological Office. The latest victim was a 33yearold woman who was killed when a tree fell on her car on the Baltic Sea island of Fehmarn on Friday afternoon, German news agency dpa reported. Three stormrelated deaths were reported in England and Scotland on Thursday and Friday. Galeforce winds whipped up storm surges on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea, breaking through flood defenses in coastal areas in Denmark and northern Germany. In Flensburg, a German city just south of the border with Denmark, water levels rose more than 2 meters to the highest level recorded in a century, dpa said. Power was cut to flooded parts of the city for safety reasons. Ferry lines and railway service were temporarily suspended in affected areas in Germany, Denmark and southern Sweden. Copenhagens airport canceled 142 flights due to the storm on Friday but resumed operations on Saturday morning. People were evacuated from homes and campgrounds in severely hit areas in Denmark and dozens of people were without power. The municipality of Haderslev in southern Denmark decided to evacuate the entire coastline. The situation on the coast is now so serious that it is too dangerous to stay there. All affected areas are evacuated and the emergency response is pulling out its crews, the municipality said in a Facebook post late Friday. It wasnt immediately clear how many people were affected. The Danish Meteorological Institute warned of strong winds and elevated water levels throughout the weekend. In Scotland, as much as 4 inches 100 mm of rain was forecast Saturday, and several towns remained under a red weather alert, the highest level, which means there is a danger to life. Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said parts of eastern and northern Scotland had already had a month and a halfs worth of rain during the storm, with more downpours coming that could push those areas close towards two months of rain in the span of three days. In the worsthit town of Brechin, residents of more than 300 homes were told to leave before the River South Esk breached its banks Friday, surging almost 4 meters 13 feet above its usual level and sending water pouring into the streets. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency warned a second major river, the Don, could breach on Saturday. Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf said, unfortunately, it is clear we have not seen the last of this storm. The storm brought disruption across the U.K., with several main roads and rail lines shut by flooding. LeedsBradford Airport in northern England remained closed Saturday. The Associated Press",1

Darren TaylorSooToday One of the Saults largest nonprofits is organizing a public information session in an effort to remind the community of the services they offer for young families. Created in 2017, the Twinkie Foundation helps support local families with travel costs when their child requires medical care out of town. The funding helps families with additional costs that a ministryprovided travel grant wouldnt cover, including hotel accommodations, rental car and transit rates, and food. Since cofounding the organization, Karen Lefave and her husband Greg have assisted hundreds of families with sick children receive the financial assistance they need to make those difficult trips including 80 families in 2023 alone. Although theyre nearing their seventh anniversary as a registered charity, Lefave says there are many eligible families who still arent aware they exist. What we need is exposure, she told SooToday. We need families to know were here. We cant help them if they have no idea. I had two applications in the last two weeks, and both of them brought up the fact that they found out about our foundation either after the fact, or they found out about us through hospitals in Toronto or London but not locally. Lefave said one local family mentioned theyve been going to Sick Kids every two months for the last three years and werent aware of the Twinkie Foundation and the travel costs they cover. Comments like those can admittedly be disappointing to hear according to the cofounder, which is why shes looking forward to hosting an information session over Zoom for community organizations and agencies who work with kids daily. I want to tell as many people as possible who work with these families, both in the medical environment and people who see these cases come up, she explains. I just want to tell people this is who we are, this is who we help, and this is how we can help. That way, they can have as much information at their fingertips as they need. I will answer any questions that anyone has on the Zoom call, she adds. Im happy so far with the requests Ive gotten so far which is great. The more exposure on this info session we can get, the better. Im excited. Among the invited organizations includes Sault Area Hospital medical staff, THRIVE Child Development Centre, Group Health Centre, local Ornge services, Midwives of Algoma, Algoma Nurse PractitionerLed Clinic, Child Care Algoma, and several daycare services. I want the Twinkie Foundation to be something families think of automatically when their child gets sick, Lefave says. The last thing they should have to do is worry about going to Toronto because they cant afford it. Our main goal is to decrease as much stress as possible for families, she adds. We obviously cant make a child better or cure a sickness or disease, but we can help in other areas like financial assistance and guidance. We want everyone to know were here. While the Twinkie Foundation receives zero government funding, the nonprofit has been given many generous donations from a number of community groups and fundraisers since their inception. From vendor shows and hockey tournaments to comedy nights and the Smile Cookie campaign, Lefave says she couldnt be more appreciative for the Saults generosity in helping families receive the care their sick children so desperately need. Weve been wildly fortunate in this city for the donations we get, she says. We dont have a lot of exposure for the families that need us, but on the flip side, we do have a lot of people who donate. To apply for Twinkie Foundation funding, the sick child must be under the age of 18 be a resident of Sault Ste. Marie or live within 100 kilometres of town have a confirmed appointment at any medical facility 200 kilometres or further outside of Sault Ste. Marie For more information on how to get involved with the Twinkie Foundation, or to join the upcoming Zoom information session on Oct. 30 at noon, contact can be made by visiting the foundations website or social media page.",1

Once a Category 4 hurricane, Norma came ashore Saturday as a Category 1 near the Pacific resort of Los Cabos at the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula. Tens of thousands were left without power. Normas gusts continued to cause damage as the storm moved northeast, crossing the Gulf of California toward the Mexico mainlands Sinaloa state, where schools were ordered closed Monday. Shelters were set up in Sinaloa and neighboring Sonora with capacity for nearly 13,000 people. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Sunday evening that Norma was about 120 miles 195 kilometers west of Culiacan, and about 65 miles 105 kilometers southsouthwest of Los Mochis. The storm regained a bit of strength as it moved northeastward across the Gulf of California with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 kph. Up to 18 inches 45 centimeters of rain could fall in some areas Monday, forecasters warned. These rains will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, the hurricane center said. In Los Cabos, fallen trees blocked some streets. But with no major damage, tourists began to emerge, some with the intention of leaving. They told us that the air terminal is now open and we want to return to San Diego, since the danger of the hurricane is over, said Henry Brown, a U.S. citizen waiting for a cab to take him and his wife to the San Jose del Cabo airport, which resumed operations in the morning. Brown acknowledged the wind was very strong Saturday but said they had no major problems because they stayed sheltered in the hotel. Others, like American Noah Johnson and his family, went for a walk to see how the beach had been left but were willing to continue their vacation, which ends on Tuesday, even though they regretted that many restaurants and other businesses remained closed. But to the north, there was no flying out of La Paz, the capital of Baja California Sur. It was hit with so much rain that the airport remained closed. Streams of water with logs, dirt and garbage crossed many of the highways so many entrances to the city were blocked. Elements of the security forces made rounds looking for people in need of help. In the citys bay, 400 people remained on a ferry that was transporting them from Sinaloa to Baja California Sur and was caught in the storm. They have not been able to get off the ferry because the port is still closed, said Santiago Jorge Morgado, commander of the Fourth Naval Region in La Paz. Baja California Sur authorities had not reported any fatalities, but said an Argentine tourist was injured. The main damage was to boats, three of which sank, Morgado said. The Mexican navy said it has 5.000 marines deployed to attend the states affected by Norma with ships, helicopters, trucks, food, water and first aid. Meanwhile, Antigua and Barbuda escaped with no reported injuries from Hurricane Tammy. A late and sudden shift spared the Antigua from a direct hit, but left the sister island in line for the systems full force during the late night hours Saturday. To the best of my knowledge, there has been no significant damage. At least we got some rain. It may not be a lot but much needed rain, a relieved Prime Minister Gaston Browne told The Associated Press. The hurricane made landfall on the 62squaremile Barbuda at approximately 915 p.m. Saturday, bringing heavy rain and winds as high as 92 mph. The storm knocked down some power lines, triggered an island wideblackout and caused minor damage to a few homes. However, no major infrastructural damage was reported. At least two families had to be evacuated by a local rescue team, Barbudas disaster coordinator, Tessa Webber, told AP. Tammy hit as the memory and trauma of Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 storm that razed the island in 2017, remained foremost in the minds of Barbudans. Antigua fared much better, with only a few broken branches and broken utility lines reported. Acting electricity manager for the countrys lone utility company, Lyndon Francis, could not yet put a timeline on restoration work in Barbuda and the few communities in Antigua that lost power during the storm. Crews were out assessing the damage, he said. Tropical Storm Otis formed over the Pacific far from Mexicos coast, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was about 500 miles 800 km southsoutheast of Acapulco. It was moving at 5 mph 7 kph northnorthwest, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph 65 kph. The NHC estimated that Otis would remain a tropical storm while moving closer to Mexico, before weakening to a tropical depression by Friday. But it said heavy rainfall may impact coastal areas of southern Mexico from Oaxaca to Guerrero later this week.

The stop was part of a whirlwind tour of cities and communities to reach out to residents, local governments and businesses to gauge what is important to their communities and see progress in ontheground projects, said Eby. While the province is working with city staff and councillors on several fronts, including housing and rural healthcare, Eby explained water is a priority after the drought and fires of the past summer. They are looking at not just flood mitigation, but water use by residents, agriculture and industry. The visit began with a walk along the dike wall between the Rotary spray park and the Kettle River and a demonstration of one of the emergency pumping, which Ben Stevens, the citys project manager for flood mitigation said was pumping about 680 litres a second. The purpose of it is to pump water out of the downtown storm sewer system in the event of another flooding event. Even at its maximum capacity, it can handle the water levels seen during the 2018 flood, plus another 10 per cent calculated for climate change, said Stevens. Afterward, Eby and an entourage of security, staff and city councillors walked to BoundarySimilkameen MLA Roly Russells office, stopping at some local businesses to meet owners and chat with residents. At Russells office, a roundtable of stakeholders, which included Regional District of Kootenay Boundary and provincial government representatives was waiting to talk water management, flood mitigation and protecting wells and aquifers. Among some of the key concerns was protecting the aquifer as longer dry periods and more people tap into the water supply. While the aquifer supplying Grand Forks is one of the biggest in the southern half of the province, many were concerned with it not being recharged over longer drought periods. As well, the rivers that run through the area, namely the Kettle and Granby, are running lower for longer and as RDKB Area C Director Grace McGregor pointed out, there is a real chance they could run dry by 2050. On the other end was preserving riparian areas from floodcaused erosion. Brian Thomas, president of the B.C. Cattlemens Association, spoke about more natural protections for those areas, such as invisible fencing for cattle herds to allow wildlife to roam freely, while at the same time keeping livestock out. Such measures would help restore riparian areas, allowing natural moisture retention, he said. Another concern was water quality. The aquifer supplying the area is vulnerable to poisoning from industrial and agricultural accidents, such as oil spills, mine tailings and nitrate contamination, pointed out Kristina Anderson, watershed planner for RDKB. There are few measures in place for people to rest their water quality, unless they do it privately. Eby said its clear the province is on the right track in implementing bringing water use under one ministry to manage this critical resource for all people and stakeholders, but there is more to be done to secure the regions and provinces water supply. We made the right move with creating this ministry to integrate how we manage this precious resource that is so important to families that turn on the tap, as well as business owners and farmers that rely on it. Its also clear to me we have a lot to do to make sure we are managing this resource for the benefit of all British Columbians.",1

The report covered the ongoing implementation of the Master Plan for the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park, and sought Councils approval of modifications to the Master Plan as well as next stages of implementation. The latest stage of work involved the completion of a comprehensive set of technical feasibility studies to define constraints and opportunities relative to the natural environment that will inform detailed design and construction plans. The Feasibility Study process is now complete and has resulted in nine specific modifications to the Master Plan that are being recommended for approval by Council through this Report. The report also provides includes an update on the status of the 2015 Acquisition Strategy. Of the privately owned lands identified for acquisition to accommodate the Burlington Beach Master Plan, six properties remain in private ownership. The next stage of the project is the design and construction planning phase. Activities will be focused on detailed design of amenities as well as the environmental restoration and this work will be initiated in the Fall of 2023. Background This report provides an update on the implementation of the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park approved Master Plan, and seeks Councils direction on amendments of the Master Plan that have resulted from the Master Plan Feasibility Studies as well as direction on the Hydro Tower relocation. The last update on the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park, commonly referred to as Beachway Park, was provided in October 2020 through Report No. LPS8820 re Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park Update. The Master Plan for the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park was developed in partnership with the City of Burlington and Conservation Halton and was approved by Regional Council in May 2015, which established a plan for securing the necessary lands needed to implement the Master Plan based on a willing buyerwilling seller program. As part of the 2016 Budget and Forecast, Regional Council approved a detailed financial plan to implement the Master Plan and the Acquisition Strategy that budgeted 51.8 million over a 20year period. Through the 2019 Budget and Business Plan, the financial plan was adjusted to 62.0 million to reflect revised market conditions and support an accelerated property acquisition strategy allocated as follows 23.8 million for park development, 12.2 million for hydro tower relocation and 26.0 million for property acquisition. Through the 2021 Budget process, the Hydro Tower component was adjusted to reflect the midlevel cost estimate identified of 23.0 million. The 2015 Master Plan is divided into six distinct park character areas. The specific timing and staging of works was envisioned to focus on implementation of Areas 1 through 4 in the first 510 years, followed by Areas 5 and 6 once property acquisition was completed. Since the Master Plan was approved in 2015, activities to implement the Master Plan have been focused on Haltons efforts to Advance enhancements in the Spencer Smith portion of the park that received Federal funding under the Canada 150 Community Infrastructure Program Complete of a set of feasibility studies for Beachway Park. The next stage of the project is the design and construction planning phase, activities will be focused on design of amenities and will include building resilience of Beachway Park to the impacts of flooding and erosion. The design and construction planning phase will be initiated in the Fall of 2023. Flooding and erosion were subjects that got little in the way of discussion in 2015 today both are top of mind. Technical feasibility studies have been underway over the last several years which were completed in May of 2023, and are now at a point to provide recommendations for updates to the Master Plan. Feasibility Studies The latest stage of work involved the completion of a comprehensive set of technical feasibility studies to define constraints and opportunities relative to the natural environment that will inform detailed design and construction plans. These studies were required to identify and mitigate potential construction and longterm maintenance risks, inform the preparation of detailed design documents, and position the project to obtain relevant permits and approvals for construction. Collectively, the findings of the studies confirmed whether the features of the 2015 Master Plan can feasibly be implemented and provide a road map for how best to restore the natural environment and improve Beachway Park as intended. In coordination with the project steering team, the consultant for the project developed an Indigenous Peoples Engagement Plan. The Indigenous Peoples Engagement Plan identifies relevant Indigenous and First Nations stakeholders and proposes an engagement strategy to involve these communities in the development and implementation of Burlington Beach. The Indigenous Peoples Engagement Plan is meant to remain a living document throughout the project and may need adjustments from time to time as the overall project progresses. Engagement will ensure meaningful engagement with the key Indigenous stakeholders identified. A key finding of the feasibility studies is the susceptibility of Beachway Park to increasing flooding and erosion. The natural beach and dune environment of Beachway Park is a rare ecosystem and without appropriate management approaches, it will remain extremely sensitive to disturbance, and ultimately habitat loss. The Park shoreline occurs along Lake Ontario, known to have large storm events 1972 and extreme water levels 2017, 2019 which have impacted adjacent development periodically. The spatial extent of the Flood Hazard Limit for existing conditions was mapped at Beachway Park. The results of the flooding analysis highlight the flood vulnerability of not only the beach and dune environment at the park, but also Lakeshore Road and the interior lands proposed for the park expansion. The term XXyear flood is used to describe the recurrence interval of floods. The 100year recurrence interval means that a flood of that magnitude has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year. A 100year flood, although less frequent than a 10year flood, is deeper and far more destructive. For this reason, the 100year flood is now more commonly used as a baseline for risk planning. The foundation for the implementation of the Master Plan includes physical works to restore, and protect from future impacts, beach and dune areas as well as restoring vegetation to secure the beach and dune ecosystems. The Beach and Dune Restoration Plan provides the details of a naturebased solution to restore the foredunes at Beachway Park and along with engineered headlands at the north end of the park. Restoring the dune system can build the necessary resiliency of the Park against erosive forces that occur during periods of high lake levels and severe storm events. Dune rehabilitation can also generate multiple cobenefits, including protecting infrastructure from coastal hazards, reducing maintenance costs associated with windblown sand, enhancing the beach for recreation, enhancing the ecosystem and maintaining beach width during periods of high lake levels. The flood risk was reevaluated based on the dune restoration in the beach management plan. The 100year flood is contained on the beach and the interior flood risk is significantly reduced, as seen in Figure 2. Feasibility of the Features of the 2015 Master Plan To assist in advancing elements of the 2015 Master Plan to detailed design, the technical feasibility of planned improvements to Beachway Park have been assessed. There are modifications to the approved Master Plan that are necessary to address feasibility challenges that have been identified as summarized below. The modifications proposed for the Burlington Beach Master Plan are included as Attachment 2. Through this report, staff are seeking Councils approval of the proposed modifications to the Master Plan. Although the proposed modifications alter the positioning of some features, the intent of the 2015 Master Plan in terms of intent and function is maintained. For this reason, staff recommend that the Master Plan be modified as described below Implementation of Master Plan Features Next Steps Similar to other Regional waterfront parks, a phased approach is proposed, where Master Plan Features will be bundled into a number of work packages for detailed design and construction. The work packages will have a spatial focus and align with the five zones within the 2015 Master Plan. The Cobble Beach Feature formerly The Living Shoreline The construction of the armour stone engineered headlands is proposed to be advanced first as this work underpins and supports restoration of the beach and the backdune areas and could take multiple construction seasons to complete. The headlands are a stone feature which are engineered to prevent beach erosion and is consistent with the shoreline to the north including Spencer Smith Park which is almost entirely armoured. Detailed design is expected to begin in 2024. The anticipated construction schedule will be informed by input from the Region and Partners and consider the current use of the Park. The Strand and the Wind Beach Features The construction of Master Plan elements associated with The Strand and Wind Beach are proposed to be advanced together given similarities in the physical works to be advanced and the integrated nature of such works. Detailed design could take place in between 2024 and 2025. A schedule for The Strand and Wind Beach will require further development. The Commons Features The schedule for advancing key Master Plan elements associated with the Commons, in particular a realigned Lakeshore Road, is contingent on acquiring properties to support proposed works. Given that the road realignment will influence how other Master Plan elements in this area are designed and constructed, it is assumed that design of Master Plan elements associated with The Commons, are not advanced until property acquisition is sufficiently complete. The Skyway and Federal Pier Features Advancing the Master Plan key elements associated with the Skyway i.e., pier upgrades and new road from the Skyway to the Canada Centre for Inland Waters CCIW is contingent on the development of an agreement with Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority and acquisition of remaining land needed to build the road. As such, the schedule for implementing The Skyway identifies efforts focused on land acquisition and the development of an agreement with Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority. It is assumed that, pending resolution of access considerations, a schedule for the design and construction of specific Master Plan elements associated with The Skyway, will be developed and the Master Plan Implementation Schedule updated accordingly. A preliminary location of the southern terminal junction has been identified within the Wind Beach character area in the 2015 Master Plan. This area is envisioned to be a passive naturalized area, showcasing the natural dune environment and trails. The 2015 Master Plan would need to be revised to accommodate a terminal junction in a manner that responds to the objectives of the Master Plan. This would result in the loss of 4900 square metres from the park and Master Plan features intended for this area. Further, easements around the structures and underground transmission cables will be required along the entire beach corridor and are still to be determined. In order to pursue this option with these significant easement requirements, the Master Plan would require significant revisions to reflect a potential underground route while competing with planned park amenities. HONI has indicated its willingness to work with the Region to ensure there is due consideration for park activities that can reasonably occur within the easement area, with considerations for safety, operational and maintenance access needs, however the amount of area required for the easements is substantial. The location of the northern terminal junction at the intersection of Elgin Street and Brock Avenue is dependent on the availability of the land owned by the City of Burlington, which is currently used to support public parking and a small park. Should it not be possible to acquire a suitable offsite location, the park would have to further accommodate the second terminal junction with the same space and buffer requirements identified above. Timing Initiatives to support Master Plan Implementation such as the Feasibility Studies, and Acquisition Strategy have advanced to a stage where the detailed design and construction phase of Master Plan features can begin. The first phase of Master Plan implementation will focus on increasing the resilience of Beachway Park to erosion and flooding impacts. In advance of detailed design, gaining closure with respect to the alignment of the HONI transmission corridor becomes critical. Should Regional Council decide to pursue undergrounding the transmission lines the work will be subject to a multiyear approval and construction process. Based on the complexity of this project, the approval and construction process of two and a half to over four years can be expected. Given that under grounding of this infrastructure would impact the entire length of the park, Master Plan implementation would largely be paused during this time. Following extensive work and investigation, the underground option has been identified as the only potentially feasible option available to reduce the visual impact of the HONI towers at Beachway Park. Given the barriers identified through the study completed, staff are recommending that Council no longer pursue the relocation of the hydro towers. Alternatives for Relocating the Hydro Towers in the Longterm Through the review of the Hamilton SubRegion Integrated Regional Resource Plan prepared by the Independent Electricity System Operator IESO dated February 25, 2019, it was identified that as part of the Middleport Area Bulk Transmission Planning Study, replacement options for the Beach Transformer Station autotransformers will be investigated. The Beach Transformer Station autotransformers are located in Hamilton and provide power transfer between the 230kV and 115kV transmission systems. Since the study will be considering the bulk system in the area, including the transmission corridor through Beachway Park, there is a possibility that it could result in a change to the requirements of the existing alignment. The study is intended to be initiated in 2027 as per the 2019 IESO plan and is unlikely to result in the implementation of the alignment options studied to date. However, if an opportunity exists for optimizing a transmission corridor such that it would make this waterfront section redundant this could be pursued at that time. Update on Other Initiatives and Activities at Burlington Beach While the Feasibility Studies and Master Plan Implementation Plan were being developed, there have been other initiatives and activities that have continued to advance at Burlington Beach. This section provides an update on those initiatives and activities. Status of Property Acquisition Strategy As outlined in the Burlington Beach Acquisition Strategy, staff estimated that the original market value estimate for the properties identified by the program would experience year over year market growth. The actual market growth seen in the Burlington area was notably higher than anticipated year over year which has led to acquisition costs being higher than anticipated. The 2015 Acquisition Strategy has led to the successful acquisition of 21 properties in the Burlington Beach area. Federal Pier The City of Burlington is working with the Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority towards an agreement for public access of the pier. Hamilton Oshawa Port Authoritys position is that they will carry out repairs, and the City will assume subsequent repairs, along with all operations. Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority will be undertaking a navigational dredging program at the Burlington Canal adjacent to Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park in 2023. Dredged material will be transported and disposed in the water adjacent to Burlington Beach and will help replenish the eroded beach area. Once the use agreement for public access to the pier between the City and Hamilton Oshawa Port Authority is finalized, the design and construction of pier features can be planned as part of the Skyway work, as mentioned above. Parking A request was made for Halton Region and City of Burlington staff to coordinate to provide additional parking options in the Burlington Beach Waterfront Park area to address historical deficiencies. These discussions were initiated in the Spring of 2023, and identified an option to temporarily assign parking ahead of the design and construction of the park features that are identified for these locations. As this is a short term solution to increase parking, this may result in the need to identify long term options to increase parking at Burlington Beach. Regional and City staff will work in partnership to support an assessment of long term options which can be completed as part of detailed design stages. Any proposed modifications to the Master Plan will be brought forward for Regional Council consideration. Archaeological Field Work One of the key deliverables of the project was to create a Cultural Heritage Assessment and Stage 1 Archaeological Assessment. In accordance with the 2011 Standards and Guidelines for Consultant Archaeologists, the Stage 1 assessment determined that the study area included areas of archaeological potential, areas of no archaeological potential and previously assessed lands of no further concern. All identified areas of archaeological potential proposed to be disturbed as part of park development were subject to a Stage 2 property assessment. Completion of fieldwork to support the Stage 2 Archaeological Assessment began in Fall 2021 and resumed in Spring 2022. As a result of the Stage 2 assessment, one site was identified to be of further cultural heritage value or interest and will require Stage 3 sitespecific assessment. The procurement process to initiate a Stage 3 assessment closed in May of 2023, with field work to commence in 2023 Dune Grass Pilot The beach features a pilot sand dune restoration site where native grass species have been planted to aid in the stabilization of the foredune from erosion. In late May 2023, four concrete base sign holders were installed in front of the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 foredune restoration sites. The beachgrass is surviving as anticipated and sand is accumulating in the foredune as desired to restore the dune structures. Further work on this pilot study will continue into Fall 2023. Where are they now Since the last update report to Regional Council in July of 2022, staff and project partners have been working to finalize the feasibility studies and lay the groundwork for key Council decisions which will direct the next stage of work on the implementation of the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park Master Plan. With technical feasibility studies complete, work will focus on design and construction of the restoration of the natural environment. From there, the design and development of the park features and amenities will begin. Once direction is provided by Council on the hydro tower relocation option, staff will advance the next stages of work on this project. Financialprogram implications Staff will continue to monitor and provide updates on the financial requirements of the implementation of the Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park Master Plan. When it comes to land acquisition, staff will continue to secure the necessary lands required to implement the Master Plan as identified through Report No. CA 0923 CS 0923 re Burlington Beach Regional Waterfront Park Update. As a result of the proposed modifications and changes, including what was budgeted for the removal of the Hydro Tower Relocation, it is proposed that the 2024 Budget and forecast be updated as follows Staff will address and further refine capital and operating impacts related to the Burlington Beach Waterfront Park Master Plan and land securement through the 2024 Budget process and future staff reports if required. This is a project that seems to have lost its way.",1

The next set of virtual hearings is open to the public via Webex using at this link. The hearing will begin at 10 a.m. each day. Viewing does not require advance registration. Amy Hamm involuntarily rose to prominence in September 2020 when she cosponsored a billboard proclaiming I heart JK Rowling referring to famous British author JK Rowling. Ms. Rowling has been outspoken in her defence of womens rights to femaleonly bathrooms, changerooms and other safe spaces where biological males may not enter. Ms. Rowling has been denounced as transphobic as part of a flood of social media abuse, some of it from high profile celebrities, making headlines around the globe. Ms. Hamm was quoted in a CBC article about the billboard, saying, Womens rights are important and we need to stand up for them and its not transphobic to do so. The sign was only up for 30 hours before the billboard company, Pattison Outdoor, covered it up and then took it down. By then, the sign had already been vandalized with paint. After complaints were made to the College, an Inquiry Committee launched an investigation in November 2020 and subsequently compiled a 332page report, mostly composed of social media posts and statements by Ms. Hamm. Three years later, the hearings are far from concluded. The next hearings are, as before, in front of a panel of British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives and will run for 10 nonconsecutive days. Ms. Hamm has already spent a total of 11 days before the panel, split in three phases three days in September 2022, four days in October 2022, and four days in January 2023. The upcoming proceedings start each day at 10 AM Pacific Time. The link goes live 5 minutes before, at 955 AM PT, and remains active for the length of the proceedings.

Ms. Hamm is accused of being discriminatory and derogatory toward transgender people in the course of her offduty advocacy for womens sexbased rights. Professional regulators are created by statute and are essentially an arm of the state, to which the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies. Nonetheless, many regulators are increasingly attempting to control what professionals are permitted to say or believe on the social and political issues of our time. This will put a chill on debate and discussion outside of only a narrow range of permissible views. An enforced consensus, where professionals who disagree keep silent for fear of losing their livelihoods, cannot be in the public interest. This is especially so in matters of science and public policy, where stifling debate prevents both science and democracy from functioning as intended. The colleges of nurses, colleges of doctors, colleges of psychologists, law societies and other regulators need to stop policing speech and stop abusing their authority by forcing woke ideology on good people like Amy Hamm, stated John Carpay, President of the Justice Centre.",1

Buying a property is a significant milestone in anyones life, and when youre considering a move or a second home in the Sunshine State of Florida, there are some unique factors to keep in mind. Florida offers a wide range of real estate options, from beachfront condos to suburban homes with crazynice amenities and everything in between. To ensure a successful and enjoyable househunting experience, here are the top 10 tips for buying a house in Florida. Understand the Florida Market The Florida real estate market is diverse and dynamic. Its essential to familiarize yourself with the states real estate landscape, which varies from city to city and region to region. Factors such as climate, proximity to the beach, local regulations and state laws, and local amenities can significantly influence property values. And remember, as a foreign buyer you may need to pay a foreign withholding tax upon the future disposition sale of any property you purchase up to a rate of 15 of the sale price though, there are exceptions. Factor that in from the beginning and be sure get educated on this topic by consulting your real estate agent, lawyer as well as specialty firms who handle FIRPTA withholdings. Determine Your Budget Financing Before you start searching for a house, its crucial to determine your budget. Consider your current financial situation, your ability to secure financing, and your longterm financial goals. Ensure that you can comfortably afford the monthly mortgage payments, property taxes, and homeowners insurance. Whether youre paying cash or seeking a mortgage, its essential to have your financing in order, including preapproval and proof of funds which often accompany any offer made to a Seller to show you can pay. Mortgage rates, down payment requirements, paying down with points, closing costs and lender regulations can vary, so research your options and choose a financing solution that works best for your situation. If you have a relationship with a Canadian bank with a U.S. subsidiary, thats a good place to start, or alternatively you can look for private lenders, but that will also mean higher mortgage rates. Choose the Right Location Florida is known for its variety of climates and lifestyles. Whether you prefer the bustling city life of Miami, the tranquility of a Gulf Coast beach town or cities like the burgeoning Sarasota area, or the suburban charm of places like Orlando, its important to select the location that suits your lifestyle and preferences. And always research neighbourhoods thoroughly to examine demographic information, crime statistics, and proximity to amenities important to you. Work with a Local Realtor Local real estate agents have valuable knowledge about the Florida market, neighborhoods, and real estate intricacies. They can guide you through the entire homebuying or selling process, from finding the right property to negotiating the deal and handling paperwork. And did you know that Title companies handle the majority of closings in Florida not lawyers But, you always have the choice to use a real estate lawyer to close your transaction, which may be more familiar to you. You can always consult a lawyer about legal issues in a contract should you choose. Be Mindful of Hurricanes and Flooding Florida is susceptible to hurricanes, especially during the hurricane season from June to November. Consider the propertys hurricane readiness, flood risk know your flood zone designation for any target property, and insurance requirements when purchasing a home. Ensure that the house has stormresistant features windows, doors, block construction, etc. and consider investing in a hurricaneproof roof. And be prepared to deal with damage despite all your precautions. Conduct a Thorough Home Inspection and Home Maintenance Due to Floridas unique climate, its crucial to perform a comprehensive home inspection. This includes checking for potential issues like mold, termite infestations, and flood damage. A professional inspection will help you avoid unexpected repair costs. Home inspection options are different in Florida than in Ontario, so ask your real estate agent for referrals. Before you are in a contract to purchase, be sure to pay attention to the myriad of maintenance costs you will be faced with, including grasscutting, fertilizing, pool service, pressure washing service, roof maintenance, pest control termites WDO and other pests, insurance, property taxes, home watch services, property management fees should you rent out your property, and unexpected issues like AC breakdowns, water intrusion, or lanai screen repairs after a storm to name a few. Add all these items to your budget. Consider Homeowner Associations and Condominium Corporations Benefits Restrictions Many Florida communities are governed by homeowner associations HOAs andor Condominium Corporations. These associations have specific rules, fees, and restrictions including on Short Term Rentals that can affect your lifestyle and budget. Make sure you fully understand the HOAs requirements, fees and reserves before making an offer. Factor in Property Taxes Florida is known for having no state income tax, making it an attractive destination for retirees, but this doesnt apply to foreign buyers. Furthermore, property taxes vary from county to county, so be prepared for fluctuating tax rates. Understanding the local property tax rates is essential when calculating your overall homeownership costs. Keep in mind that foreign buyers will have a higher property tax rate than a Florida resident with homestead status. Timing Matters Floridas real estate market experiences seasonal fluctuations. Consider timing your purchase to take advantage of lower prices where possible, which often occur during the summer months when the heat can deter some buyers. However, keep in mind that interest rates and market conditions can change rapidly, so consult your realtor for the best timing strategy. In the relative sense, Floridas market is still fairly hot, so being able to make quick decisions is key to getting what you want. Short Term Rentals Should you decide to purchase an investment property in Florida, its imperative to understand any local and state regulations on STRs as well as restrictions within communities governed by a Homeowners Association HOA or Condominium Corporation. Its not unusual for STRs to have minimum rental period requirements 1 month or more, and maximum number of rentals per year. Know before you buy. Conclusion Buying a house in Florida can be a dream come true, but it requires careful planning and consideration. By following these top 10 tips, you can navigate the Florida real estate market with confidence, ensuring that you find the perfect home in the Sunshine State that fits your budget and lifestyle.

2023-10-23T14:33:01Z,en,flood,all,B.C.&#39;s disaster management needs an overhaul | The Narwhal,"Massive wildfires, major <b>floods</b>: B.C. has no shortage of disasters. Will the proposed Emergency and Disaster Management Act help progress?","tag:google.com,2013:googlealerts/feed:17935221457105122152",https://thenarwhal.ca/bc-emergency-diaster-management-act/,"The proposed Emergency and Disaster Management Act will define how citizens and communities across B.C. Photo Jen OsborneBowinn Ma, minister of emergency management and climate readiness, introduced the act on Oct. 3. In particular, McNeil is concerned about clause 162 which says that, in cases of conflict, the Emergency and Disaster Management Act prevails over all other provincial acts and regulations. Consultation and coordination will, undoubtedly lead to stronger emergency management and disaster risk management. There certainly is a need for clarity on the disaster and emergency management response.","The Brooks home will never be like it was before the 2021 floods in British Columbia. Two years ago, extreme rain filled the Similkameen and Tulameen rivers. Water burst over the banks through a dike and flooded siblings Dian and Danies property just outside of Princeton. The two rushed to save their animals and waited for two days in the second level of their home before a rescue boat came. As Dian watched their homemade furniture bob in the deluge, she remembers thinking, There goes our house. There goes everything that we have worked for our lives. We have just lost everything. With help from volunteers, some funding from government and insurance they have since repaired some of the damage and are back inside. But the two pensioners are still waiting on the provincial government to respond to their appeals for more help. We have no money. As it is, were broke. We will be paying for this for the rest of our lives, Dian told The Narwhal. Southern B.C. was hit by its first atmospheric river of the season last week, a fitting backdrop as the province debates how to address emergencies and disasters. The proposed Emergency and Disaster Management Act will define how citizens and communities across B.C. are or are not supported by the government when disaster strikes, Chad Pacholik, a disaster risk manager told The Narwhal. The bill has seen years of engagement and delays and getting to the vote stage to implement the law could still take weeks, or longer. The provinces ombudsperson is also calling for urgent action to improve support for longterm evacuees after another summer of recordbreaking wildfires. The hope is this bill will help address decades of government inaction as climate change increases the number and severity of disasters faced by people across the province. But some experts in emergency management say key elements are missing that would ensure the legislation is clear, easy to implement, properly acknowledges First Nations and supports enough capacity within communities to implement changes. Quite literally, lives could depend on the framework and the law thats being discussed here today. Communities depend on us, as well, to get this right, Shirley Bond, BC United MLA for Prince GeorgeValemount, said last week in the legislature, as the proposal saw days of debate. Time is of the essence. Dian and Danie Brooks are still working on repairs after their home just outside of Princeton, B.C., was hit by floodwaters in November 2021. Photo Jen Osborne Bowinn Ma, minister of emergency management and climate readiness, introduced the act on Oct. 3. The 122page draft is a significant update from the previous 12page Emergency Program Act, which was last updated in the 1990s. It recognizes First Nations inherent rights, aims to address modern risks like COVID19 and climate change and acknowledges the importance of risk reduction, mitigation and preparedness along with response and recovery. There is also a clause that sets the act to be reviewed within five years. This legislation formally recognizes the rights of First Nations as decisionmakers in emergency management, Ma said as the bill was introduced. The Emergency and Disaster Management Act moves towards a holistic fourphase approach of mitigation, preparation, response and recovery. It requires climate risk assessments and updates the concept of what an emergency is, to reflect modern realities. Changes will hopefully prove to be a step in the right direction, Robert Phillips, First Nations Summit political executive said in a press release. The First Nationsled group supports nations in treaty negotiations. It will be imperative that this new legislation results in strong governmenttogovernment relationships with First Nations in all aspects of emergency management, premised on acknowledgement and respect for First Nations title and jurisdiction within their respective territories. Step in the right direction, but not far enough If done right, new legislation could help improve how displaced people are supported after major disasters, Tyrone McNeil, chair of the Emergency Planning Secretariat, Stl Tribal Council president and Tribal Chief, told The Narwhal. But as it stands, the current draft of the bill is disappointing. McNeil, a member of Seabird Island Band, wants to see evacuee programs modelled after the United Nations Sphere Project, a humanitarian aid program better designed to address longterm disaster displacement. The provinces current program is designed for an apartment building in Vancouver burning and people vacating for a week or two and they are rehomed, McNeil said. Indigenous people in B.C. are more likely to experience evacuations than nonIndigenous people, according to an analysis in The Tyee. In part, this is because colonizers forced First Nations onto reserves, governmentcreated tracts of land that are often in spots prone to risks and hazards and dont have enough protection, such as dikes to minimize flooding. The Indian Act also undermined the ability of First Nations to selfgovern and make decisions for the safety of their communities. Tyrone McNeil, Stl Tribal Council Chief and chair of the First Nations Emergency Planning Secretariat, pushed for more transparent consultation on the draft versions of the emergency preparedness bill before it was presented to legislature. Photo Jesse Winter The Narwhal The stress of evacuation, the stress of multiple evacuations by certain people is going to significantly impact their health over time, McNeil said. A humanitarian approach would also encompass spirituality, how to take care of Elders and dietary needs. Lets be proactive and lets invest early on. While the draft recognizes First Nations inherent right of selfgovernment and lawmaking in relation to emergency management, McNeil isnt satisfied. Its a prescriptive piece of legislation that doesnt fully incorporate our rightful place in emergency management, McNeil said. In particular, McNeil is concerned about clause 162 which says that, in cases of conflict, the Emergency and Disaster Management Act prevails over all other provincial acts and regulations. McNeil worries this clause could be interpreted to mean this act supersedes B.C.s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. Our rights and title are not properly placed and recognized and respected, in the current draft McNeil said. Community capacity is an issue Capacity is crucial as communities grapple with the growing frequency and intensity of disasters. That means having enough paid, trained professionals to handle everything from mitigation to recovery, providing access to standardized emergency management training, ensuring smaller municipalities and regional districts have enough funding and arent overly reliant on volunteers. Frontline delivery of emergency evacuee support is done overwhelmingly by volunteers, B.C.s ombudsperson Jay Chalke said at a press conference. His office reviewed the provinces response to the 2021 wildfires and atmospheric rivers. We heard about people who were working 15, 16, 17 hours a day, seven days a week for months on end as volunteers this model cannot be sustained. Most local governments are already having trouble meeting current requirements, disaster risk manager Pacholik told The Narwhal. The new legislation adds a lot more things to the plate, and we dont have a lot more trained, experienced people to be able to take on those tasks. Pacholik worked with local governments and Emergency Management B.C. when the legislation was still being developed and currently consults with First Nations and local governments to help them navigate disaster preparation, response and recovery. He said the new proposed act puts a lot more on local governments and First Nations, Pacholik said. I think theres going to be some struggles to try and keep up.

People in the area were forced out of their communities for weeks as wildland firefighters tried to get the wildfire under control. Photo Mike Graeme The Narwhal While its a positive step that the act puts a greater emphasis on consultation and coordination, some First Nations already lacking capacity will now have multiple entities approaching them to maintain this requirement, Pacholik said. Consultation and coordination will, undoubtedly lead to stronger emergency management and disaster risk management. But all takes time. The bill needs to enable First Nations to build capacity in a sustainable fashion, McNeil said. Hes called for government funding to be dispersed faster, more community access to professional support and incentives for people to take on advanced degrees and training. Pacholik said the act does strengthen some opportunities for collaboration it makes it easier for two or more local authorities or Indigenous government bodies to work together on certain requirements like preparing a risk assessment or emergency management plans. And overall, he thinks the bill is more inclusive and comprehensive than past legislation, Pacholik said. But while it has a stronger legal lens, he feels that many might struggle with the application of the bill if it becomes legislation in its current state. Its very aspirational language, that envisions a world where disaster riskreduction is prioritized and wellresourced and good relationships exist between all parties that need to work together. That is going to take some work in some areas of the province to get there. Language matters The draft is too complicated and should be put into plain language, emergency management professional Tarina Colledge said, so that it can be understood and applied by people who arent academics or policy experts. Reading through it sends you in circles as you follow various references to different sections and pages. In her 17 years of experience working on public safety with local government, Colledge has worked in British Columbia and Alberta and has been deployed to disasters in New Brunswick, Texas and Washington. Words matter and terminology needs to be consistent, Colledge told The Narwhal. The act, for example, doesnt define what a disaster is, instead referring to the old act for a definition. How can you have an emergency disaster management act that doesnt have disasters Colledge asked, adding that a clear definition is fundamentally necessary to ensure a clear understanding of what actions need to be taken when. Clear alerting systems are important to ensure people know when to prepare for a possible evacuation. Many alerting systems across the province require residents to optin to receive messages by text. Photo Mike Graeme The Narwhal Its a confusing oversight as there already is common terminology established by Public Safety Canada, Colledge said. The federal department defines an emergency as a present or imminent event that requires prompt coordination like a neighbourhood fire that is growing out of control. A disaster is when a phenomenon exceeds or overwhelms the communitys ability to cope such as a major wildfire requiring evacuation. Shes also concerned that the terms critical incident, incident, emergency and disaster are used interchangeably. Unclear definitions can lead to public safety issues down the road, Colledge said, because in a disaster, people on the frontlines need a common understanding to reduce miscommunication. It would be like changing the names of the tools in an operating room. Your gurney is not a gurney, your scalpel is not a scalpel. Opposition parties respond to proposed Emergency and Disaster Management Act During debate about the proposal, official opposition members from BC United said they were encouraged the government is acknowledging past issues but expressed concerns that this legislation falls short. There certainly is a need for clarity on the disaster and emergency management response. Im not convinced that this bill provides that clarity, MLA for West VancouverSea to Sky Jordan Sturdy said. The next step for the bill is a committee hearing where MLAs will ask questions, suggest changes and present a revised version for a vote. The House will then vote on the updated version and either send it back to committee for further changes or have further debate. A final vote by the members of the legislative assembly is needed before the bill is made into law. Bowinn Ma, minister of emergency management and climate readiness centre, met with emergency volunteers, fire chief, crews and evacuees this summer as wildfires hit Central Okanagan. Six firefighters were killed in the provinces recordbreaking wildfire season. Photo Province of British Columbia Flickr We have to really think about how do we get these big government machines to be more humanscaled, more oriented towards community and able to operate in a more effective and nimble way when there are real disasters that strike, Sonia Furstenau, leader of the B.C. Green Party, told The Narwhal. Furstenau said she is looking forward to discussing the bill further and finding out if local authorities and First Nations have enough capacity, resources and authority to drive significant change. McNeil is hopeful more changes will be made in the committee phase. He wants to see clear acknowledgement of Indigenous Rights, mechanisms for funding and language that encourages greater innovation and resilience. We really need to enable and support innovation, McNeil said. Particularly when it speaks to climate resilience and naturebased solutions, because those are the two longterm solutions on any disaster, whether it be floods, fires, tsunami, sealevel rise resilience is the best way forward. Alongside the legislation, the B.C. government is also creating an emergencies task force. This group is made up of 14 experts in emergency and wildfire management and will begin work immediately and provide actionoriented recommendations on enhancing emergency preparedness and response in advance of the 2024 wildfire season. Its past time While politicians debate legislation, flood survivors like Dian Brooks are still living in damaged homes, waiting for answers from government programs meant to help evacuees. After the 2021 atmospheric river events, she and her brother applied for funds through the provinces Disaster Financial Assistance program, which provides financial support to people who suffer sudden, unexpected and uninsurable losses as a result of an extreme weather event. Only disasters listed by the province are eligible. After months of navigating applications, assessments, site visits and paperwork, the Brookses received about 12,000 from their insurance, which the provinces program required them to spend before applying for any other assistance. They eventually received about 51,000 from Disaster Financial Assistance, far from what they say was needed. The siblings have since appealed the amount but still havent received a decision from the government. There is currently no required timeline for appeal decisions as of February 2023, Emergency Management BC received 182 appeal requests for the atmospheric river events and had completed just 12 requests. It upheld the original decision in all appeals. The same day disaster legislation was introduced this month, B.C.s ombudsperson Jay Chalke released a report detailing the failures in government response to the heat dome, wildfires and floods in 2021. It focused on the two main programs designated to help evacuees facing everything from an apartment fire to major wildfires and flooding Disaster Financial Assistance and Emergency Support Services and found that neither program has been adequately adapted as major disasters increase in frequency and intensity. The community of Merritt, B.C., had to evacuate as unprecedented amounts of rainfall triggered landslides and devastating flooding in November 2021. Approximately 7,000 people evacuated and many had to stay in hotels for months. Photo Ian Willms The Narwhal Chalke found the programs are outdated, underresourced, inaccessible and poorly communicated. His team surveyed almost 500 British Columbians affected by floods and fires. Many of them echoed Brooks experience of delays, bureaucracy, long waits and lack of clear communication. Chalke called on the government to take urgent action to better support people who are increasingly being displaced from their homes due to climaterelated disasters. Chalke also raised serious concerns about inequity in support delivery. The current onesizefitsall approach of these programs unfairly creates barriers for people to access the supports they need. The report detailed evacuees long waits for decisions about their aid requests, and described the governments communication as limited and confusing. It also criticized leaders for ignoring years of warnings, going back to 2003, that B.Cs systems were not set up for disasters that force people out of their homes for weeks or months. Successive leaders in government have, so far, failed to respond to clear direction for improvement in the provinces disaster response programs and capacities, reads the ombudspersons report. Brooks agreed the governments delay was unacceptable. Its past time, Brooks told The Narwhal. Past governments havent followed through on their promises because they dont have to. Thats the thing that bothers me. Theres money spent to make these reports and they get shelved. Nothing happens. The ombudsperson made 20 recommendations on how to improve the provinces Disaster Financial Assistance and Emergency Support Services. These include more capacity to handle applications, better recognition for frontline volunteers, accessible reception centres and flexible and responsive support for all evacuees. Chalke also called for a plan to help people facing longterm displacement, greater capacity building and funding for First Nations and a policy to reassess insurance availability across the province. Chalke also called for changes to be implemented over the next two years. At a press conference following the reports release, he acknowledged that new legislation could take years to see changes on the ground. What cant wait is a comprehensive plan to respond to people who are displaced from their homes for long periods, he said. Dian Brooks is grateful she and her brother, and all their animals, made it out of the 2021 floods alive. But there is still frustration with government inaction to protect their home from flooding, the slow response and ongoing recovery. Photo Jen Osborne Minister Ma told The Narwhal the province wasnt surprised by the recommendations and has accepted all of them. Weve already done a lot of work over the last few years to try to address or progress on addressing these concerns, Ma said. And there will still be work to do moving forward as well. The province is transitioning to an online registration system in an attempt to provide assistance faster it will send evacuees relief through etransfers, instead of requiring them to stand in line, fill out paperwork and wait for vouchers. There have also been changes to the Disaster Financial Assistance program to expand farm owner and small business eligibility. The new legislation speaks to our desire to no longer focus solely on response to emergencies, Ma told The Narwhal. We need to get ahead and be better at preparing for mitigating the impacts of disasters before they happen. The draft will evolve over the next few weeks as it makes its way through the legislative process. When implemented, it will still take years for related regulations to be developed. Brooks says she refuses to be defeated and is grateful that her brother and her as well as their animals made it out safely. But the todo list of repairs feels relentless from the roof, fencing, field repairs, front deck and walkway. We are not beggars at the gate. This is taxpayers money, Brooks said. She estimates they still have about 150,000 of work to go. Im angry at our government because I think that they have a very large part in this Theres stuff they can do about this. Theyre just not doing it. Editors note The ombudspersons report findings echo those in The Tyees Bracing for Disasters series, reported by Francesca Fionda in collaboration with the Climate Disaster Project. Both found people are being evacuated in B.C. for weeks, not just days, and government support has not adapted to the climate crisis.

AP A decade after they were first envisioned in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy s destruction, two of the largest flood control projects designed to protect the densely populated cities of New Jersey that lie just outside New York City finally got underway Wednesday. The projects will cost nearly 298 million and are designed to protect some of the regions most vulnerable communities. It calls for building 9,000 linear feet about 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers of flood walls, installation of flood gates and construction of berms and levees. Most of the work will be done in Hoboken, but parts will extend to protect areas of Jersey City and Weehawken, which also sit along the Hudson Riverfront across from Manhattan. And as big as they are, the two projects starting Wednesday pale in comparison to huge flood control efforts being contemplated by the federal government.","HOBOKEN, N.J. AP A decade after they were first envisioned in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy s destruction, two of the largest flood control projects designed to protect the densely populated cities of New Jersey that lie just outside New York City finally got underway Wednesday. A project in Hoboken, which was inundated by flooding during the 2012 storm, and another in the densely populated Meadowlands region, which also saw catastrophic flooding, kicked off. The projects will cost nearly 298 million and are designed to protect some of the regions most vulnerable communities. Both projects were formulated by the group Rebuild By Design, which was initiated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2013, and New Jersey environmental officials. Rebuild By Design looked at ways to reduce flood risk and increase resiliency in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, and it launched a series of projects that are in various phases of planning or construction. Eleven years ago, Superstorm Sandy pounded this community, said Shawn LaTourette, New Jerseys environmental protection commissioner. He noted that properties were under water for prolonged periods and there were deaths in the region attributable to the storm. That experience was a wakeup call in New Jersey that we need to invest more deeply to build our resilience to these risks, he said. Former Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, who was in office when Sandy hit on Oct. 29, 2012, said we realize how lucky we are that we have not had a major storm surge event in 11 years. Its not a matter of whether the next storm will hit, she said. Its a matter of when. RBD Hudson River is by far the larger of the two undertakings, costing 215 million. It calls for building 9,000 linear feet about 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers of flood walls, installation of flood gates and construction of berms and levees. Most of the work will be done in Hoboken, but parts will extend to protect areas of Jersey City and Weehawken, which also sit along the Hudson Riverfront across from Manhattan. Ravi Bhalla, the current Hoboken mayor, said that when the current project is completed in a few years, nearly 80 of the city will be protected by some form of storm barrier. The RBD Meadowlands project will add a highpower pumping station capable of moving 50 cubic feet 1.4 cubic meters of water per second in Little Ferry, a floodprone community along the Hackensack River. It also will add another new pumping station capable of moving 10 times that much water on a waterway in Carlstadt and Moonachie. Channel improvements also will be made there. Sandy hit the nations most populous metro area on Oct. 29, 2012. It swamped coastline communities, knocking out power, flooding transit systems and setting neighborhoods ablaze. Its blamed for 182 deaths, including 12 in New Jersey and 48 in New York, and caused tens of billions of dollars worth of damage, including 36.8 billion in New Jersey and 32.8 billion in New York. Chester cited numerous projects already completed in Hoboken as part of the postSandy floodproofing efforts. They include planting more grass, trees and vegetation in urban areas to absorb rainfall and allow less runoff to flood streets and storm sewers. Hoboken has already built three socalled resiliency parks in which green space is designed to absorb water, while runoff is collected in underground storage tanks and slowly released after a storm has passed. Amy Chester, managing director of Rebuild By Design, said recent heavy rains that caused massive flooding in New York City did not cause similar chaos in Hoboken, due in part to the resiliency work. And as big as they are, the two projects starting Wednesday pale in comparison to huge flood control efforts being contemplated by the federal government. They include a 52 billion plan to build movable barriers and gates across bays, rivers and other waterways in New York and New Jersey, and a 16 billion plan to address backbay flooding in New Jersey by building movable storm gates at inlets and across bays. Theres also discussion of elevating 19,000 buildings near waterways in many parts of the state. Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly known as Twitter, at httpstwitter.comWayneParryAC.

AP The debris and mud slide near the base of the road to the Okemo ski resort have long been cleared away, and open flags now hang outside shops and restaurants in a small Vermont ski town hit by severe flooding this summer. As winter approaches and the fall tourism season lingers, Ludlow businesses that lost out on summer tourism want to get the word out that they are open, even though some are still in the throes of rebuilding. As far as our businesses, Id say 90 plus have reopened, Ludlow Town Manager Brendan McNamara said. Some are still just coming down that final stretch to open, especially for the fallwinter season, but weve come a long way and town is ready for the winter season. Waiting with open arms. Ludlow was one of the Vermont communities hit hardest by the July flooding that not only inundated businesses and homes with floodwaters but heavily damaged the town post office and wastewater treatment plant. The post office reopened two weeks ago, though the towns flooddamaged grocery store remains closed. Businesses that were not physically damaged by the flooding suffered economic losses from the lack of visitors. Were open for business and ready to go, Mark Verespy, owner of The Killarney pub, said of the town. As far as the infrastructure goes, its there and were just kind of filling in a few small gaps, but they should be done for winter. Some think there wont be enough restaurants in town to meet winter demand, particularly if the grocery store doesnt reopen soon. The Shaws grocery store said in a statement that it plans to reopen as soon as possible but didnt say when that would be. For now, customers can shop online and pick up their orders in the store parking lot. The town hopes it reopens by December, McNamara said. Troy Caruso, who owns five restaurants and a golf course in town, lost Sams Steakhouse to flooding and is seeking a government buyout. He isnt sure yet what he will do with the flooddamaged Mr. Darcys Bar Burger next door, but if he rebuilds, it wont be ready for the winter season. His other three restaurants will definitely be open full tilt, he said, though business is down about 35. Its a little slow. I mean all the numbers are down. The restaurant numbers are down. The golf numbers are down. Everythings down, Caruso said. After the flooding, Okemo, which sits on higher ground, was able to reopen its bike park, summer camp and scenic lift rides in late July. Now its preparing for the winter season and plans to start snowmaking next month. Guests can feel confident that they will get the great ski and ride experience they have come to expect at Okemo, and we look forward to welcoming skiers and riders back this winter, Courtney DiFiore, a spokesman for Okemo, which is owned by Vail Resorts, said by email. After the floodwaters receded, community members showed up to help clean out Eight Oh Brew, a bar on the lower level of an old mill building. Even when it all happened, youd come down here, its dark, youre feet are in mud, were all working with headlamps, and really the community was great. Not even asking, theyd show up, said David Del Tufo, owner of the family business. People who come to the bar just came to help. He said the business has been caught up in red tape, waiting for a permit and guidelines for rebuilding. Its received some funding from the state and community as well as individual donations through a GoFundMe campaign whose donors his wife, Lisa Del Tufo, described as amazing. If they can find an electrician a challenge in a state that has a shortage of licensed electricians and plumbers exacerbated by the flood recovery David Del Tufo said they hope to reopen by midDecember. The drive from the community, they really want us back, he said. Were listening to them and were not going to give up just yet.",1

Marie were in shock Tuesday after what the mayor called an inexplicable outburst of violence that left five people including three children and a shooter dead and police investigating a case of intimate partner violence. Police said a shooter went to two homes on Monday night, gunning down multiple victims, before dying of a selfinflicted gunshot. The citys mayor, Matthew Shoemaker, said Sault Ste. Marie was trying to make sense of something that there is no making sense of. It is inexplicable that anybody could do this to loved ones, he told The Canadian Press in a phone interview. It is much more difficult to process and comprehend when it involves children. Police Chief Hugh Stevenson called what happened a tragic and unnecessary loss of life. The grief the families, friends and loved ones of the victims are facing is unimaginable, he wrote in a statement. As our community grieves this tragedy, I urge everyone to please watch out for each other. Police said the shootings were not random acts of violence and there was no ongoing risk to public safety. They also said they would not be releasing the names of the victims or the accused because it was an intimate partner violence case. Police were alerted to the shootings late Monday night, they said. Officers first discovered the body of a 41yearold, dead from a gunshot wound, around 1020 p.m. after someone called to report a breakandenter at a home, police said. The shooter appeared to have fled and about 10 minutes later, police received another call for someone with a weapon at a home about three kilometres north from the previous residence. Police said they found three children aged six, seven and 12 shot dead in that second home and a 45yearold who was injured with a gunshot wound. They said officers also found the 44yearold shooter, who appeared to have died after a selfinflicted gunshot wound. Tyson Jikinosky, who works at an auto repair shop in the neighbourhood, said there was still a visible police presence in the area on Tuesday morning. He said he learned of what happened by reading the news and that it came as a shock. Its a really, really, really ugly, ugly scenario, he said. I live a few blocks away. Its a pretty small town, so were all pretty close. The Algoma District School Board said it was mourning the loss of three students in Sault Ste. Marie. The entire Algoma District School Board community is heartbroken, the boards director of education, Lucia Reece, wrote in a statement. Counsellors and support staff have been put in place at schools impacted by this tragedy ... Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been affected. Shoemaker, the mayor, voiced hope that the community would support those suffering in the aftermath of the tragedy, especially relatives of the victims. We want the family of the victims to know that they can lean on their neighbours, they can lean on their community members, he said. I trust there will be results from this investigation that will likely spur change in our community and hopefully beyond, the mayor said. Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste. Marie was gutwrenching. This senseless loss of life has left family, friends and an entire community grieving, he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. All of Ontario mourns this tragedy. Police spokesman Lincoln Louttit said investigators had learned more about the shooter through witnesses who came forward. Its crucial to the community that we let them know that this tragic event had taken place. But we also need to make sure that the investigation can continue and as well protect other victims that are involved, Louttit said. Were not going to be providing any other details with the investigation at this point. Officers were at both homes on Tuesday, police said, and the investigation continues.

Marie were in shock Tuesday after what the mayor called an inexplicable outburst of violence that left five people including three children and a shooter dead and police investigating a case of intimate partner violence. Police said a shooter went to two homes on Monday night, gunning down multiple victims, before dying of a selfinflicted gunshot. The citys mayor, Matthew Shoemaker, said Sault Ste. Marie was trying to make sense of something that there is no making sense of. It is inexplicable that anybody could do this to loved ones, he told The Canadian Press in a phone interview. It is much more difficult to process and comprehend when it involves children. Police Chief Hugh Stevenson called what happened a tragic and unnecessary loss of life. The grief the families, friends and loved ones of the victims are facing is unimaginable, he wrote in a statement. As our community grieves this tragedy, I urge everyone to please watch out for each other. Police said the shootings were not random acts of violence and there was no ongoing risk to public safety. They also said they would not be releasing the names of the victims or the accused because it was an intimate partner violence case. Police were alerted to the shootings late Monday night, they said. Officers first discovered the body of a 41yearold, dead from a gunshot wound, around 1020 p.m. after someone called to report a breakandenter at a home, police said. The shooter appeared to have fled and about 10 minutes later, police received another call for someone with a weapon at a home about three kilometres north from the previous residence. Police said they found three children aged six, seven and 12 shot dead in that second home and a 45yearold who was injured with a gunshot wound. They said officers also found the 44yearold shooter, who appeared to have died after a selfinflicted gunshot wound. Tyson Jikinosky, who works at an auto repair shop in the neighbourhood, said there was still a visible police presence in the area on Tuesday morning. He said he learned of what happened by reading the news and that it came as a shock. Its a really, really, really ugly, ugly scenario, he said. I live a few blocks away. Its a pretty small town, so were all pretty close. The Algoma District School Board said it was mourning the loss of three students in Sault Ste. Marie. The entire Algoma District School Board community is heartbroken, the boards director of education, Lucia Reece, wrote in a statement. Counsellors and support staff have been put in place at schools impacted by this tragedy ... Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been affected. Shoemaker, the mayor, voiced hope that the community would support those suffering in the aftermath of the tragedy, especially relatives of the victims. We want the family of the victims to know that they can lean on their neighbours, they can lean on their community members, he said. I trust there will be results from this investigation that will likely spur change in our community and hopefully beyond, the mayor said. Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste. Marie was gutwrenching. This senseless loss of life has left family, friends and an entire community grieving, he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. All of Ontario mourns this tragedy. Police spokesman Lincoln Louttit said investigators had learned more about the shooter through witnesses who came forward. Its crucial to the community that we let them know that this tragic event had taken place. But we also need to make sure that the investigation can continue and as well protect other victims that are involved, Louttit said.

In a written report, the U.K.based Internet Watch Foundation urges governments and technology providers to act quickly before a flood of AIgenerated images of child sexual abuse overwhelms law enforcement investigators and vastly expands the pool of potential victims. Were not talking about the harm it might do, said Dan Sexton, the watchdog groups chief technology officer. This is happening right now and it needs to be addressed right now. In a firstofitskind case in South Korea, a man was sentenced in September to 2 12 years in prison for using artificial intelligence to create 360 virtual child abuse images, according to the Busan District Court in the countrys southeast. In some cases, kids are using these tools on each other. At a school in southwestern Spain, police have been investigating teens alleged use of a phone app to make their fully dressed schoolmates appear nude in photos. The report exposes a dark side of the race to build generative AI systems that enable users to describe in words what they want to produce from emails to novel artwork or videos and have the system spit it out. If it isnt stopped, the flood of deepfake child sexual abuse images could bog investigators down trying to rescue children who turn out to be virtual characters. Perpetrators could also use the images to groom and coerce new victims. Sexton said IWF analysts discovered faces of famous children online as well as a massive demand for the creation of more images of children whove already been abused, possibly years ago. Theyre taking existing real content and using that to create new content of these victims, he said. That is just incredibly shocking. Sexton said his charity organization, which is focused on combating online child sexual abuse, first began fielding reports about abusive AIgenerated imagery earlier this year. That led to an investigation into forums on the socalled dark web, a part of the internet hosted within an encrypted network and accessible only through tools that provide anonymity. What IWF analysts found were abusers sharing tips and marveling about how easy it was to turn their home computers into factories for generating sexually explicit images of children of all ages. Some are also trading and attempting to profit off such images that appear increasingly lifelike. What were starting to see is this explosion of content, Sexton said. While the IWFs report is meant to flag a growing problem more than offer prescriptions, it urges governments to strengthen laws to make it easier to combat AIgenerated abuse. It particularly targets the European Union, where theres a debate over surveillance measures that could automatically scan messaging apps for suspected images of child sexual abuse even if the images are not previously known to law enforcement. A focus of the groups work is to prevent previous sex abuse victims from being abused again through the redistribution of their photos. The report says technology providers could do more to make it harder for the products theyve built to be used in this way, though its complicated by the fact that some of the tools are hard to put back in the bottle. A crop of new AI imagegenerators was introduced last year and wowed the public with their ability to conjure up whimsical or photorealistic images on command. But most of them are not favored by producers of child sex abuse material because they contain mechanisms to block it. Technology providers that have closed AI models, with full control over how theyre trained and used for instance, OpenAIs imagegenerator DALLE have been more successful at blocking misuse, Sexton said. By contrast, a tool favored by producers of child sex abuse imagery is the opensource Stable Diffusion, developed by Londonbased startup Stability AI. When Stable Diffusion burst onto the scene in the summer of 2022, a subset of users quickly learned how to use it to generate nudity and pornography. While most of that material depicted adults, it was often nonconsensual, such as when it was used to create celebrityinspired nude pictures. Stability later rolled out new filters that block unsafe and inappropriate content, and a license to use Stabilitys software comes with a ban on illegal uses. In a statement released Tuesday, the company said it strictly prohibits any misuse for illegal or immoral purposes across its platforms. We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes, the statement reads. Users can still access older versions of Stable Diffusion, however, which are overwhelmingly the software of choice for people creating explicit content involving children, said David Thiel, chief technologist of the Stanford Internet Observatory, another watchdog group studying the problem. The IWF report acknowledges the difficulty of trying to criminalize AI imagegenerating tools themselves, even those finetuned to produce abusive material. You cant regulate what people are doing on their computers, in their bedrooms. Its not possible, Sexton added. So how do you get to the point where they cant use openly available software to create harmful content like this Most AIgenerated child sexual abuse images would be considered illegal under existing laws in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere, but it remains to be seen whether law enforcement has the tools to combat them. A British police official said the report shows the impact already witnessed by officers working to identify victims. We are seeing children groomed, we are seeing perpetrators make their own imagery to their own specifications, we are seeing the production of AI imagery for commercial gain all of which normalizes the rape and abuse of real children, said a statement from Ian Critchley, child protection lead for the National Police Chiefs Council. The IWFs report is timed ahead of a global AI safety gathering next week hosted by the British government that will include highprofile attendees including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and tech leaders. While this report paints a bleak picture, I am optimistic, IWF CEO Susie Hargreaves said in a prepared written statement. She said it is important to communicate the realities of the problem to a wide audience because we need to have discussions about the darker side of this amazing technology.

In our view, the Canadian West Coast ports are at risk of having lost volumes longer term to U.S. and Mexican alternatives. Weve lost a little confidence in the West Coast ports, she said. Revenues decreased 12 per cent to 3.99 billion from 4.51 billion the year before, the Montrealbased company said.","Canadian National Railway Co. is reporting a nearly onequarter drop in profits for the three months ended Sept. 30. CN rail trains are shown at a train yard in Vaughan, Ont., on Monday, June 20, 2022. THE CANADIAN PRESSNathan Denette MONTREAL Canadian National Railway Co. reported a drastic drop in profits for the three months ended Sept. 30, citing falling consumer demand, fallout from the B.C. port workers strike and a raft of forest fires and floods. Overstocked inventories and dockworkers 13day job action in July dented its cargo volumes and revenue, as did ravenous wildfires and floods at both ends of the country. Net income in CNs third quarter fell 24 per cent from a year earlier, the company said. It was tough operating out there in quarter three, Ed Harris, CNs chief operating officer, told investors on a conference call Tuesday. We started out by dealing with a twoweek port strike on the West Coast and then faced constant disruptions from forest fires and flooding until September, said Harris, whos set to step down from that role on Nov. 15. The countrys largest railway saw revenues in its biggest category container shipping drop by more than a third, due in part to consumers smaller postpandemic appetite for pricey products. I believe weve seen the bottom on volumes, CEO Tracy Robinson said, referring to container shipments. Nonetheless, she added that consumer activity continues to be murky amid an uncertain economic environment. What remains to be seen is exactly the strength of the economy returning. Container volumes at the B.C. ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert failed to recover in August after the previous months strike, dropping by 23 per cent and 59 per cent, respectively, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Walter Spracklin. That trend lingered into September. The Canadian West Coast port strike this summer prompted vessel operators to divert away from Canadian ports entirely, to other destinations such as Los Angeles and Lzaro Crdenas Mexicos largest seaport Spracklin said in an Oct. 13 note to analysts. In our view, the Canadian West Coast ports are at risk of having lost volumes longer term to U.S. and Mexican alternatives. CN chief marketing officer Doug MacDonald said the company is working to woo container customers back to Canadian ports and tracks following the costly shutdown of the countrys biggest sea trade gateway. We continue to see a hangover effect, he said. Depressed freight rates at trucking companies pose an added competitive challenge, executives said. Robinson sought to reassure analysts despite the sharp decline, noting that domestic container shipments as opposed to those bound for the U.S. enjoyed sustained demand. We think this is a temporary issue, the CEO said, acknowledging that any rampup in international container traffic from B.C. docks may be gradual. Weve lost a little confidence in the West Coast ports, she said. All five of CNs bulk categories, from coal to forest products, saw a revenue decrease except grain, which shot up 16 per cent on the back of a bumper wheat crop. Auto volumes also rose amid persistent demand following the supply chain backlog prompted by the COVID19 pandemic. Executives said CN continues to expect flat to slightly negative adjusted earnings this year, while forecasting growth of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent between 2024 and 2026. On Tuesday, the railroad operator reported net income in its third quarter fell to 1.11 billion from 1.46 billion in the same period a year earlier. Revenues decreased 12 per cent to 3.99 billion from 4.51 billion the year before, the Montrealbased company said. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings were down 21 per cent at 1.69 per share from 2.13 per share last year, slightly below analyst expectations of 1.72 per share, according to financial data firm Refinitiv.

As a resident of the Kootenays and Past President of the BC Wildlife Federation BCWF I am supportive of Arrow Reservoir water level stabilization and Columbia salmon returning to BC which from the public commentary seems to be the First Nations and provinces primary ecosystem restoration priority. What the public has not been informed of to date is what is the quid pro quo Are there ecosystem costs elsewhere To achieve Arrow Reservoir level stabilization means foregoing some water storage which means it probably must be foundreplaced elsewhere unless BC Hydro is willing to forego power production which is unlikely. Reduction of water storage on the Arrow and options to replace it are questions I am certain BC Hydro can answer and should answer now, not after the fact. The public needs to know what is being given up to stabilize the Arrow Reservoir Unless a new dam is built water storage lost on the Arrow can only be made up from increased storage on Kinbasket Reservoir Mica Dam or possibly some on Revelstoke Reservoir, Duncan Reservoir or from Kootenay Lake. The answer is likely all of the above and this is concerning for residents of Kootenay Lake and possibly explains why BC Hydro continues to advocate dredging of Grohman Narrows for greater control of Kootenay Lake levels under the false guise of flood control. Recall we were promised in 1964 under the original Treaty that flood control was a certainty with construction of Duncan, Arrow and Libby Dams. A good journalist can dig up those promises of yesteryear. The relevant questions iswhat has changed that requires even further flood control on Kootenay Lake or is this requirement actually in anticipation of greater storage on the lake as part of CRT renegotiations My intention in writing this letter is to have a more fulsome public discussion about what Kathy Eichenberger and team are negotiating about our future waterways. Is Kootenay Lake about be abused yet again and if so how does this fit with socalled ecosystem restoration that is the third pillar of the Columbia Treaty renegotiation strategy Perhaps our local MLAs can inform us since the CRT negotiating team is subject to confidentiality and seemingly provides only selective, positive information.

Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste.","Residents of the northern Ontario city of Sault Ste. Residents of the northern Ontario city of Sault Ste. Marie were in shock Tuesday after what the mayor called an inexplicable outburst of violence that left five people including three children and a shooter dead and police investigating a case of intimate partner violence. Police said a shooter went to two homes on Monday night, gunning down multiple victims, before dying of a selfinflicted gunshot. The citys mayor, Matthew Shoemaker, said Sault Ste. Marie was trying to make sense of something that there is no making sense of. It is inexplicable that anybody could do this to loved ones, he told The Canadian Press in a phone interview. It is much more difficult to process and comprehend when it involves children. Police Chief Hugh Stevenson called what happened a tragic and unnecessary loss of life. The grief the families, friends and loved ones of the victims are facing is unimaginable, he wrote in a statement. As our community grieves this tragedy, I urge everyone to please watch out for each other. Police said the shootings were not random acts of violence and there was no ongoing risk to public safety. They also said they would not be releasing the names of the victims or the accused because it was an intimate partner violence case. Police were alerted to the shootings late Monday night, they said. Officers first discovered the body of a 41yearold, dead from a gunshot wound, around 1020 p.m. after someone called to report a breakandenter at a home, police said. The shooter appeared to have fled and about 10 minutes later, police received another call for someone with a weapon at a home about three kilometres north from the previous residence. Police said they found three children aged six, seven and 12 shot dead in that second home and a 45yearold who was injured with a gunshot wound. They said officers also found the 44yearold shooter, who appeared to have died after a selfinflicted gunshot wound. Tyson Jikinosky, who works at an auto repair shop in the neighbourhood, said there was still a visible police presence in the area on Tuesday morning. He said he learned of what happened by reading the news and that it came as a shock. Its a really, really, really ugly, ugly scenario, he said. I live a few blocks away. Its a pretty small town, so were all pretty close. The Algoma District School Board said it was mourning the loss of three students in Sault Ste. Marie. The entire Algoma District School Board community is heartbroken, the boards director of education, Lucia Reece, wrote in a statement. Counsellors and support staff have been put in place at schools impacted by this tragedy ... Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been affected. Shoemaker, the mayor, voiced hope that the community would support those suffering in the aftermath of the tragedy, especially relatives of the victims. We want the family of the victims to know that they can lean on their neighbours, they can lean on their community members, he said. I trust there will be results from this investigation that will likely spur change in our community and hopefully beyond, the mayor said. Premier Doug Ford said the news out of Sault Ste. Marie was gutwrenching. This senseless loss of life has left family, friends and an entire community grieving, he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. All of Ontario mourns this tragedy. Police spokesman Lincoln Louttit said investigators had learned more about the shooter through witnesses who came forward. Its crucial to the community that we let them know that this tragic event had taken place. But we also need to make sure that the investigation can continue and as well protect other victims that are involved, Louttit said. Were not going to be providing any other details with the investigation at this point. Officers were at both homes on Tuesday, police said, and the investigation continues.

Nelson Bennett An abundance of natural gas will flood onto the global market in the form of liquefied natural gas LNG, starting in 2025, with Canada being among the countries contributing to a sudden surge, and with Russia being the biggest loser, according to the International Energy Agency IEA. In its newly published 2023 World Energy Outlook, the IEA predicts the demand for all three fossil fuels coal, oil and natural gas will peak in 2030, and then start to decline, with coal experiencing the sharpest declines, based on current stated policy scenarios STEPS. The share of coal, oil and natural gas in global energy supply stuck for decades around 80 per cent starts to edge downwards and reaches 73 per cent in the STEPS by 2030, the outlook forecasts. A sharp decline in coal demand will come from countries switching from coal power to renewables and other lower carbon fuels, including natural gas. But even natural gass days are numbered, the IEA predicts. The Golden Age of Gas, a term coined by the IEA in 2011, is nearing an end, the outlook declares. Global natural gas use has increased by an annual average of almost 2 per cent since 2011, but growth slows in the STEPS to less than 0.4 per year from now until 2030. Demand for coal to drop precipitously. The outlook shows Canada making an entrance on the world stage as sizeable LNG exporter in 2025. But once the first big bolus of Canadian LNG hits the world market mostly from the LNG Canada project in Kitimat future incremental increases of LNG exports from Canada are projected to be relatively small, compared to the U.S. and Qatar, which are expected to account for 60 per cent of the new volumes of LNG. Starting in 2025, an unprecedented surge in new LNG projects is set to tip the balance of markets and concerns about natural gas supply, the outlook states. Projects that have started construction or taken final investment decision are set to add 250 billion cubic metres per year of liquefaction capacity by 2030, equal to almost half of todays global LNG supply. Additions of LNG from countries like the U.S., Qatar, Canada and Australia may come at Russias expense. This additional LNG arrives at an uncertain moment for natural gas demand and creates major difficulties for Russias diversification strategy towards Asia, the outlook predicts. The strong increase in LNG production capacity eases prices and gas supply concerns, but comes to market at a time when global gas demand growth has slowed considerably since its golden age of the 2010s. The glut of LNG means there are very limited opportunities for Russia to secure additional markets. Russias share of internationally traded gas, which stood at 30 per cent in 2021, is halved by 2030 in the STEPS. U.S., Qatar account for 60 of new LNG volumes. IEA Russia is a major oil and natural gas producer. But after it invaded Ukraine, oil and natural gas markets were upended, triggering a major energy crisis, which had in fact been brewing in Europe before the war in Ukraine. Russia lost a massive European market for its natural gas overnight. The energy crisis it exacerbated has accelerated the move to renewables, conservation and various lower carbon forms of energy and transportation. A legacy of the global energy crisis may be to usher in the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era the momentum behind clean energy transitions is now sufficient for global demand for coal, oil and natural gas to all reach a high point before 2030 in the STEPS, the outlook states. In advanced economies, the rebound in natural gas demand seen in 2021 did not last long, and demand in 2022 was below prepandemic levels. This faltering in demand reflects a shift to renewables in electricity generation, the rise of heat pumps, and Europes accelerated move away from gas following the Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine. Just how much the global demand for coal, oil and natural gas will fall depends a great deal on China, which may no longer be the economic juggernaut it once was. If Chinas growth averages under four per cent per year between now and 2030, the IEA projects that Chinas total energy demand will start peaking the middle of this decade. To underscore just how important China is, in terms of global energy consumption, the IEA notes that a single one per cent decline in Chinas annual economic growth would reduce Chinese LNG imports by 20 per cent. If Chinas nearterm growth were to slow by another percentage point, this would reduce 2030 coal demand by an amount almost equal to the volume currently consumed by the whole of Europe, the IEA notes. Oil import volumes would decline by 5 per cent and LNG imports by more than 20 per cent, with major implications for global balances. The David Suzuki Foundation has seized on the IEAs latest forecast to suggest no more LNG projects should be built in B.C. The IEAs authoritative assessment proves, again, that LNG is the wrong choice at the wrong time, John Young, the foundations B.C. Energy Transition Strategist, said in a press release. Any new LNG projects in B.C. brought online or beginning exports after 2025 would likely end up as stranded assets. No new LNG supply is needed in a world rapidly shifting to renewable energy as the climate crisis intensifies. Global demand for gas is slowing down. B.C. missed the golden era of gas and projects that begin construction now are likely to become stranded assets. But despite its projections for fossil fuels peaking, the IEA outlook warns against halting all investment in fossil fuels. Continued investment in fossil fuels is essential in all of our scenarios, the outlook says. It is needed to meet increases in demand over the period to 2030 in the STEPS and to avoid a precipitous decline in supply that would far outstrip even the rapid declines in demand seen in the NZE net zero Scenario. The outlook also warns against overinvestment, however, depending on how rigorous governments are in meeting climate policy targets. Investment in oil and gas today is significantly higher than the amounts needed in the APS announced pledges scenario and almost double what is needed in the NZE Scenario. This creates the clear risk of locking in fossil fuel use and putting the 1.5 C goal out of reach. Nonetheless, simply cutting spending on oil and gas will not get the world on track for the NZE Scenario the key is to scale up investment in all aspects of a clean energy system to meet rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way. Both overinvestment and underinvestment in fossil fuels carry risks for secure and affordable energy transitions. nbennettbiv.com twitter.comnbennettbiv",1

Leau qui a refoul ne semblait pas provenir des gouts, elle ntait pas sale. Par contre nous avons eu six pouces deau et nous avons d arracher le bas des murs et refaire le pltre , dplore Mme Chouinard. Cette dernire a observ quune part du refoulement provenait dun tuyau qui descendait du toit jusquau sol, dans les drains municipaux. Lizette Castonguay est, quant elle, propritaire dun btiment situ sur la rue du PrcieuxSang. Son soussol a dabord t inond en septembre 2022. a sentait mauvais, mais nous avons vacu leau tout de suite, se rappelle la dame. Le plancher a compltement t refait, comme le pltre et les plinthes.

En entrevue avec LAction, le maire, PierreLuc Bellerose, rappelle que les pluies survenues au cours de lanne taient exceptionnelles, mais il ajoute quil prend cur la problmatique et que des ides seront mijotes pour viter ce genre de situations lavenir. Le conseil veut revoir son plan directeur afin de savoir quels seront les investissements privilgier pour ne pas se retrouver dans une situation comme celles que nous avons vcues durant les dernires annes , indiquetil. Il explique que plusieurs rues du centreville et le chemin de la BasedeRoc ont subi des rnovations dans cette optique. Le quartier SainteThrse serait galement lun des secteurs prioriser. Les lus de Joliette rflchissent aussi la possibilit de mettre en place un programme qui aiderait les rsidents rendre leurs installations adquates Dans plusieurs cas, il ny a pas de clapets ou de drains conformes. Donc nous sommes voir ce qui pourrait tre fait pour accompagner les citoyens. Le maire souligne que la Ville investit chaque anne de 20 30 M pour la rfection de ses infrastructures et il assure que cet effort continuera. Nous allons voir pour le bonifier pour viter de nous retrouver dans une situation instable cause des changements climatiques. Pour nous, cest une priorit et dans le prochain budget, nous allons envoyer un signal clair ce sujet , assure M. Bellerose. Ce dernier informe en outre que lUnion des municipalits du Qubec avait fait une demande auprs du gouvernement pour des subventions de plusieurs milliards afin de contrer les effets des changements climatiques. Toutefois, aucun programme de ddommagements nexiste pour linstant, mis part des programmes de scurit publique, disponibles lorsquun cours deau cause des inondations. En terminant, le maire tenait apporter une nuance aux sujets de certaines rumeurs selon lesquelles la densification des quartiers de Joliette exerait une pression sur les installations. Tous les nouveaux secteurs viennent avec des bassins de rtention et des infrastructures qui font en sorte quon ne se trouvera pas avec cette problmatique , prcise PierreLuc Bellerose. En outre, le conseil municipal planifie la mise en place dune soire dinformation au cours des prochains mois afin dexpliquer les changements dsirs au plan directeur en plus des investissements prvus dans le futur budget.

Le futur dystopique est dj l, a dclar rcemment le hautcommissaire des Nations unies aux droits de lhomme. Il alertait alors sur les consquences bien relles de la crise climatique sur les flux migratoires. Confrontes aux rpercussions directes des changements climatiques scheresses, inondations, temptes, incendies, etc., mais aussi indirectes aggravation de la pauvret, inscurit alimentaire, pnuries deau et dautres ressources naturelles, certaines populations nont dautre choix que de quitter leur rgion ou leur pays. Le site Web des Nations unies nous apprend que, au cours de la dernire dcennie, les vnements climatiques extrmes ont entran en moyenne 21,5 millions de dplacements chaque anne, soit plus du double de ceux causs par les conflits et la violence. Ce phnomne actuel et croissant soulve plusieurs questions existetil un encadrement lgal pour ce type de dplacements Quels sont les recours des populations concernes Comment les gouvernements peuventils les aider Comment devrionsnous appeler ces migrations Comment les migrants sontils perus dans lopinion publique Tels sont les enjeux qutudie Sarah Munoz, doctorante au Dpartement de science politique de lUniversit de Montral sous la direction des professeurs Erick Lachapelle et Pascale Dufour. Une ralit mal dfinie Sarah Munoz Crdit Courtoisie lheure actuelle, les personnes forces de se dplacer en raison des perturbations climatiques ne sont pas reconnues comme rfugies, bien quelles migrent pour assurer leur scurit, leur sant, leur bientre et leur subsistance. Lappellation rfugi climatique nexiste pas au sens lgal du terme. Le statut de rfugi est protg dans le droit international et concerne des individus perscuts en raison de leurs opinions politiques, leur appartenance sociale, leur religion ou leur nationalit. Selon Sarah Munoz, si ltiquette rfugis nest pas exacte, les noms migrants ou dplacs sapprochent de la ralit. Mais le terme le plus juste devrait tre mobilits climatiques, puisquil prend davantage en compte la complexit du phnomne. Il existe plusieurs formes de mouvement limmobilit rester sur place malgr la vulnrabilit , la mobilit circulaire partir et revenir , la mobilit interne la plus frquente, soit partir pour une autre rgion et la mobilit internationale, cestdire traverser une frontire, explique la chercheuse. Dans lil du public Le vocabulaire utilis serait important, puisquil influence lopinion publique. Des tudes montrent quon ne serait pas empathique la cause des rfugis climatiques, puisquils ne sont pas oppresss par un rgime politique. En Allemagne, toutefois, la population considre que lEurope serait en partie responsable des changements climatiques, donc quil lui revient daider les pays qui en sont victimes, dcritelle. La chercheuse ajoute que lapprciation des rfugis ou des migrants climatiques varie selon les pays et les opinions politiques prexistantes sur les questions migratoires et les changements climatiques. Et ultimement, lopinion publique dteint sur la volont politique, premier vecteur permettant damliorer les conditions des populations vulnrables et leurs capacits dadaptation. Les politiques au cur des enjeux Pour Sarah Munoz, les mobilits climatiques dpendent largement du contexte politique. Dune part, les populations vulnrables se voient souvent contraintes de rester sur place malgr les risques quand les gouvernements affichent un ngationnisme climatique et ninvestissent que peu ou pas dans des politiques sociales et conomiques visant amliorer la rsilience durable. linverse, la mobilit semble facilite lorsque les tats ont des politiques qui accroissent la capacit des habitants sadapter aux changements climatiques.

The Pacific storm had strengthened with shocking swiftness before slamming into the coast early Wednesday, and the Mexican government deployed around 10,000 troops to deal with the aftermath. But equipment to move tons of mud and fallen trees from the streets was slow in arriving. Resentment grew Thursday in impoverished neighborhoods as residents worried that government attention would go to repairing infrastructure for the citys economic engine of tourism rather than helping the neediest. Flora Contreras Santos, a housewife from a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the city, sought help in looking for a 3yearold girl who was swept away from her mother in a mudslide. She went from soldier to soldier trying to interest any one of them in the tragedy that occurred on her street at the height of the storm. The mountain came down on them. The mud took her from the mothers arms, Contreras said. We need help, the mother is in bad shape and we cant find the girl. Even as army bulldozers began clearing kneedeep mud from Acapulcos main boulevards, Contreras pleas did not appear to move any of the soldiers to action. President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador went by road Wednesday after the hurricane hit the iconic city on Mexico s Pacific coast. At least four people remained missing. It was unclear if the 3yearold girl was counted among them. The president said Otis had toppled every powerline pole in the zone where it hit on Wednesday, leaving much of the city of 1 million without electricity. Otis turned from mild to monster in record time, and scientists were struggling to figure out how and why they didnt see it coming. The people sheltered, protected themselves and thats why fortunately there werent more tragedies, loss of human life, Lpez Obrador said. Acapulcos municipal water system was down and around half a million homes lost power. Lpez Obrador said that restoring power was a top priority, but by Thursday evening there were still 300,000 homes and businesses with no electricity. Brown floodwaters extended for miles in some areas. Many residents were taking basic items from stores to survive. Others left with pricier goods, in widespread rampages through the areas stores. As cell phone signals began to return to some parts of the city, residents organized themselves with the help of friends and relatives living in other parts of Mexico and the United States. They joined together by neighborhood using online messaging platforms like WhatsApp. On Thursday there were some 1,000 people in 40 chats, which only continued to grow in number throughout the day. They shared photos of flooded neighborhoods and tips for finding cell phone signals, while asking for information about loved ones that they had not heard from. Others share photos of papers full of names of survivors taking refuge in shelters, some with notes reading Lupita, we are okay. I will call you when we have signal. When someone joins from a neighborhood theyre asked by people outside the city to look for other residents there. Juan Pablo Lpez, 26, had been talking to his wife when their call was cut off early Wednesday as Otis made landfall. She had returned to Acapulco to be with her family and give birth to their son a month ago. Lopez was at home in Cancun. Im very worried for my newborn son, he said. With no information coming in Wednesday, he created an online chat with friends and family from Guerrero state, where Acapulco is the largest city. He also invited friends who had emigrated to the U.S. and asked them to add their local contacts. We started to crossreference information, to share what we found, almost like a WhatApp newspaper, Lopez said. By Thursday afternoon, however, he still had not heard word about his wife and son. The surreal was commonplace in the stormwrecked city, as residents emptied the areas stores of goods. Ricardo Daz, a selfemployed laborer, stood Thursday with two fistfuls of live chickens he clutched by their legs. A chicken company had given him the chickens, Daz said. A woman nearby pushed an office chair loaded with artificial Christmas wreaths and toilet paper through the streets. Daz looked on in dismay as people carried armfuls of goods out of a damaged store. Theyre going to close these stores and that hurts Acapulco, Daz said. Edith Villanueva, holding her daughter, worried about what would happen to Acapulco in the long term. She worked at a cell phone store that had already been cleaned out. They already stole all of the phones, she said. Its one thing to steal food, but people are abusing it. Acapulcos police chief Enrique Vzquez Ramrez said Thursday they could do little to stop people from emptying local stores or speed up traffic caused by mud and fallen trees, which has left much of the city paralyzed. This is a completely extraordinary situation, he said. Some residents said it could take a year for Acapulco to recover with no power, gasoline, little cell coverage and hotels wrecked by the hurricane, the task seemed impossible. Marketing expert Antonio Esparza was one of the few optimistic ones, even as he sat trapped in the snarled traffic of the aftermath. This is going to improve Acapulco, because it will force the government to pay attention, he said. Large stores that had their merchandise taken were not restocking their shelves, meaning finding goods could become harder. But streetproduce vendors were doing a brisk business in some neighborhoods as residents sought fresh food. The oncesleek beachfront hotels in Acapulco looked like toothless, shattered hulks after the Category 5 storm blew out hundreds possibly thousands of windows. Miguel Angel Fong, president of the Mexican Hotel Association told the AP that 80 of the citys hotels were damaged. Hundreds of trucks from the government electricity company arrived in Acapulco on Wednesday but downed electricity lines were in feet of mud and water. It took nearly all day Wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting Acapulco to the state capital Chilpancingo and Mexico City. The vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. Acapulcos commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights, though Lpez Obrador said the plan was to establish an air bridge to move in resources. Acapulco is at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific Ocean. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, the port has in recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving away many international tourists.

While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage Acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late Wednesday experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast. The hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by Wednesday afternoon but appeared to have left a fair amount of devastation in its wake. Acapulcos Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water.

Maries historic lighted cross is illuminated at dusk Wednesday as police hold the scene of a tragic intimate partner violence killing on Tancred Street. Kenneth ArmstrongSooToday A longtime social worker in Sault Ste. Marie is offering direction for families who may be struggling to help their kids cope with Monday nights shootings that claimed five lives, including three children aged 6, 7, and twelve. For the past 18 years, Kerri Dool has provided counselling services to residents of all ages. For nearly half that time, she has worked directly with students and young children in the Saults education system. While she recognizes this weeks incidents were incredibly violent, the support tactics her team members offer remains relatively the same. Any time we take a traumainformed approach to any crisis or serious incident, the guidelines are similar, Dool told SooToday. The most important thing to remember is the humanity in this, as well as the compassion and empathy we all need for those people who are struggling. Theres no linear movement through grief, she added. Its a process, and this is going to be a process of grieving that takes a very long time to overcome as a community. Realizing there are likely some parents in the community struggling to help their children cope with the tragedy, Dool says its important to check in with the little ones on a consistent basis. See what they already know about the tragedy, she suggested. Did the school share information Did they send a letter home that parents can reference with their children The grief counsellor noted that its okay to use direct language when talking about what happened this week, especially when the child is likely to hear about the devastating themes at school or in other places outside their household. Dont be afraid to say the children were killed. You dont have to be mysterious about what happened because I think your kids are going to hear that somewhere else anyway, she said. Its better to hear it in a safe environment where parents can provide support. During times of stress, Dool mentioned children may not function in the same capacity they normally do. But taking a trauma informed approach with them by lowering their fears and rationalizing their thoughts can go a long way, according to the experienced social worker. The fear response can become very heightened during a time like this, and you may even feel like theyre becoming paranoid of things that they didnt used to be aware of, she said. Asking them pointed questions like How often has your fear materialized in the past What are some things we can do to stay safe when you get worried about safety Those are ways we can help them switch over from that emotional response. Other tips Dool offered to parents include Have conversations about what intimate partner violence is and what healthy family relationships look like Use your own experience of death so kids know that we understand it Remind your children that its okay to cry and validate their emotions Reassure your kids by reviewing safety protocols your family may have in place at home Be aware of behavioural changes staying in their room, less socialization, not sleeping Model healthy coping as a parent, such as engaging in selfcare Check in with children on how theyre feeling physically butterflies in tummy, chest tightness, shortness of breath Take part in stressrelief exercises like deep breathing and meditation exercises on YouTube, Communicate with your childs support circle school, coaches, doctor, other parents In response to Mondays tragedy, Dool and her wellness team is offering a parent support group called Parenting Through Trauma. We really want to be there for our community right now, she said. We know that resources were stretched to begin with, and its hard for people to have access to services at times. We want to make sure people are resourced and supported. For families interested in the support group, or other options like parentdirect counselling and children and youth counselling, Dools team can be contacted by emailing email protected or by clicking here. Meanwhile, the Supportive Care Team at ARCH Hospice took to social media Wednesday afternoon to remind residents they also offer grief support for all ages. Our community has suffered immense loss within the last few months and this most recent tragedy has hit home for a lot of our community, their post stated. Please know that during this time, whatever you are feeling is okay. Grief is unique and very difficult to navigate. Be gentle with yourself and know that you are not alone. Grief Support at ARCH can be accessed by calling 7059421556 ext. 239 for children and youth Lana and ext. 242 for adults Laura. ARCH also offers online resources, and they are available by clicking here and here. Additionally, the nonprofit has a book titled The ABCs of Death for parents and caregivers on how to talk with children who may have questions about death, dying, or grief. ARCH will be hosting a series of workshops designed in coordination with the ABCs of Death book. The purpose of this workshop is to provide locals with practical tips and tools on how to Reflect on your own comfort with Death, Dying and Grief Talk to Children about Death and Dying Support a Child who is grieving Practice Self Care for the Caregiver The upcoming dates will be posted on ARCHs website for further information. Readers who would like a copy of the book can call Lana, or they can receive an ecopy by clicking here. Counselling services are also available for students attending Boreal French Immersion and Superior Heights, which the Algoma District School Board announced in a statement Wednesday afternoon. The school board has assigned a traumatic events response team at both schools to help classmates of the deceased and any children who are struggling with Mondays tragedy.",1

It turns out that a brilliant little animal that we nearly hunted to extinction could play an important role in protecting our homes and the environment from these extreme weather events. Thats right not only are beavers brilliant ecosystem engineers that create habitat for countless other species, they also play a key role in adapting to our changing climate. Beavers reduce the impacts of wildfires, floods and drought Beavers rich wetlands are like sponges they store water during drought and make ecosystems less vulnerable to extreme weather changes. They also keep surrounding areas wet throughout so they dont readily burn, and instead act as firebreaks. Not only do beaver ponds resist wildfire, they also mitigate flooding by controlling and releasing water more gradually. They slow the water as it comes down the mountainsides, says ecologist Annette Lutterman, who has spent years researching beavers, particularly around her hometown of Golden. These dams often work in conjunction with one another. Near Kicking Horse Mountain Resort, one beaver complex has seventeen dams in a row along one stream Together, they allow raging spring snowmelt to be absorbed into the soil and surroundings rather than causing flooding. Communities that have suffered extreme flood events over the past few years are concerned about logging in upper parts of the watershed because it also increases flash flooding. Beaver infrastructure helps. Beavers create critical habitat for other species With only their bare paws and incisors, beavers shape freshwater habitat building wetlands and marshes that are incredibly rich in biodiversity. These beaverbuilt ecosystems create invaluable habitat for other species including fish, mammals, waterfowl, songbirds, amphibians and insects. Beavers have incredible foresight, ensuring their ponds have sufficient depth so as not to freeze to the bottom in winter so they can forage underwater for food all winter long. This depth also helps to regulate water temperatures during summer, which benefits other aquatic species, such as salmon, that could overheat in shallower waters. They are also big on excavating. Theyll dig canals going out from their pond so that when they forage for food, they can cut down a shrub and float it back to their lodge, rather than dragging it across the land. They prefer to float the food back because its easier, and theyre less vulnerable to predation. So they dig these canals, which are really important nursery areas for small fish, Annette explains. Beavers create healthier forests Not only is the water table higher in the forests surrounding beaver activity, but the microclimate is more humid which, in times of chronic drought, leads to healthier forests and ecosystems. Active beaver ponds also sequester an impressive amount of carbon. Each year, beaver wetlands like our Columbia Wetlands store about 470,000 tons of carbon globally. Not out of the woods Given how instrumental beavers are in protecting our landscapes and our homes its clear we should be doing our best to keep them around. North Americas beaver population has rebounded since protections were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its still estimated to be about 10 of what it was prior to colonization, and human activities continue to threaten beavers survival. One of the single biggest threats to beavers is trapping. Problem beavers are regularly killed for impacting human infrastructure. When beavers handiwork floods a road or property, a permit will often be issued to dispose of the animal and destroy its habitat. If they compromise industry by burrowing into the railbed within the wetlands or threatening a piece of road, for example CP or the Ministry of Transport will hire a trapper to get rid of them. Annette has tried to inquire as to how many permits are given out annually to kill beavers, but the government has refused to provide any information. Beavers are frequently trapped or killed illegally without permits as well, sometimes just to use the castoreum castor sacks, or their meat as bait for hunting. Hydroelectric dams pose another significant threat. Young beavers stay with their parents for about two years before venturing out to find habitat of their own, usually a few kilometres away. Theyll settle on what they think is a normal water body and try to establish a new lodge. But when water levels change quickly from water being let out of a dam or building up inside it the young beavers are wiped out. How can we help beavers help us Practices can and should be in place to mitigate beaver conflict. Research has shown that relocation can be effective when done properly. There are also beaver deceivers aka pond levellers which only allow beaver ponds to reach a certain depth, preventing flooding upstream. These contraptions trick beavers into thinking that no water is exiting their pond, simply because the flow is silent. They were developed based on an experiment done years ago to better understand where beavers instinctual desire to block water comes from. Scientists recorded the sound of running water on a cassette tape, played it on dry land near the stream overnight, and came back to find that the beavers had packed mud and sticks on top of it. Much is left to be done to protect beavers and their ecosystems here in BC. Weve got all kinds of mountain bike trails and new roads and infrastructure thats being built, and we have to figure out how we can adapt to that so beavers can come back, Annette says. As communities, we can anticipate locations where humanbeaver conflicts may arise and preemptively install levellers that both meet beavers needs and mitigate flood risk. If you happen to hear of a beaver conflict, inform people about positive alternatives to trapping or dam destruction. Suggest pond levellers or point them in the direction of helpful resources. Most importantly, share your knowledge tell your friends and family how invaluable beavers are, and explain how they help preserve landscapes and homes. Now more than ever, it is time we stopped working against beavers and started working with them.",1

While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage Acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late Wednesday experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels looked like toothless shattered hulks, after Hurricane Otis blew out hundreds and possibly thousands of hotel windows. This satellite image provided by NOAA on Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023, shows Hurricane Otis approaching Mexicos Pacific coast near Acapulco. Otis is forecast to make landfall early Wednesday and there is a hurricane warning in effect from Punta Maldonado to Zihuatanejo. NOAA via AP Choked with mud and debris, with no electricity or internet service, the Pacific coast resort descended into chaos after the storm, as thousands engaged in massive looting. The hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by Wednesday afternoon, but left devastation in its wake. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. We laid down on the floor and some between beds, Sauczuk said. We prayed a lot. One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mess. He complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held, said Navarro. But there were some rooms where the wind blew out the windows and the doors. Tourists sit on the beach in Acapulco, Mexico, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023. Hurricane Otis has strengthened from tropical storm to a major hurricane in a matter of hours as it approaches Mexicos southern Pacific coast where it was forecast to make landfall near the resort of Acapulco early Wednesday. AP PhotoBernardino Hernandez Navarro said authorities seemed to have been blindsided by the hurricanes rapid intensification. He stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mudchoked streets outside. This is out of control, he said. Acapulcos Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other lessflooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. While much of the city was in the dark and without phone service, some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK. Alicia Galindo, a 28yearold stylist in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potos, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. Her parents and brother were staying in Acapulcos Hotel Princess for an international mining conference when Otis hit. A tourist rides a horse at a beach in Acapulco, Mexico, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023. Hurricane Otis has strengthened from tropical storm to a major hurricane in a matter of hours as it approaches Mexicos southern Pacific coast where it was forecast to make landfall near the resort of Acapulco early Wednesday. AP PhotoBernardino Hernandez They told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down until everything was gone, she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. However, Galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. Everybody is trying to find something out but no one knows anything, she said anxiously. The main highway into Acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of Wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. By late Wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced. Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside Acapulco on Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried shed lose them in the muck. The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay. Campos said.

AP PhotoMarco Ugarte On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Researchers tracking the storm told The Associated Press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time when climate change has exacerbated devastating weather events like this one. Its one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when youre expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when youre not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, said Mexican President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been completely lost. Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the citys hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, Acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, Lpez Obrador said. Mexicos Secretary of National Defense told the AP on Wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that over 1,200 more were on their way. Officials also said they were working to restore power and phone service. Lpez Obrador noted that Otis was a stronger hurricane than Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people.

The 230kilometrelong Arrow Lakes Reservoir made up of Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake was created when the Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in 1968 under the treaty. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver. Speaking to West Kootenay residents with Conroy, Canadian treaty negotiator Stephen Gluck said while an ad hoc regime will give Canada more control over waterflow in theory, it also introduces uncertainty. The key is, Canada and B.C., we entered into this treaty willingly, as partners with the United States, Eichenberger said.","I would say that when it was negotiated in 1961 and entered into force in 1964, it probably was one of the most important if not the most important water treaties in the world, said Nigel Bankes, professor emeritus at the University of Calgarys Faculty of Law, whose expertise includes the Columbia River Treaty. Its significance was really that it provided for the cooperative development of the Columbia River the cooperative development of storage for flood control and power purposes, and for a sharing of the benefits associated with those developments. The treaty was forged after catastrophic flooding of the Columbia River in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, Ore., near Portland. It led to the creation of three dams in B.C. and a fourth in Montana in the Columbias drainage basin, serving both flood control and hydropower generation. But recent extreme weather such as this years severe drought in B.C. has exposed problems in the agreement that residents of the Columbia River Basin say need to be urgently addressed. The 230kilometrelong Arrow Lakes Reservoir made up of Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake was created when the Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in 1968 under the treaty. The reservoirs water level had fallen to 423.7 metres above sea level on Tuesday a low not reached in more than two decades. Nakusp resident Youmans said whats even more concerning is that its only October, and the lakes usually dont reach their lowest annual levels until late winter or early spring. I personally have never seen it this low, and Ive lived here for over 20 years, said Youmans, who is among 3,900 members of a Facebook group that wants to slow the flow of Arrow Lakes to the United States. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver. There are other commercial concerns. Nakusp Mayor Tom Zeleznik said low water levels had rendered parts of the reservoir unnavigable for vessels carrying logs, resulting in the closure of some businesses, and forcing reliance on costlier land transport. Katrine Conroy, the provincial minister on the Columbia River Treaty file and the MLA representing Kootenay West, said the province is legally obligated by the treaty to direct water to the United States for flood protection, powergeneration purposes, as well as for fish. Its really frustrating to be faced with a situation that feels like theres very little that you can do to fix it, Conroy said in an information session held for West Kootenay residents on Oct. 18, saying her position as the minister responsible for the treaty does not give her a seat at the negotiating table. The latest round of negotiations, which were the 19th since talks began in 2018, concluded in Portland on Oct. 13. My position doesnt give me a magic wand, Conroy said. I cant cancel a treaty or change its terms or requirements Often as a government minister, Im confronted by problems and issues that are hundreds of kilometres away, but for me, this one hits very, very close to home. Its in my backyard. Conroy is also B.C.s minister of finance. Federal, provincial and First Nations delegates are represented at the talks with U.S. authorities. If a new floodcontrol agreement isnt reached by September next year, the treaty currently calls for a shift to an ad hoc regime, with U.S. authorities having to rely on their own dams capacity for flood control before being able to call upon Canadian dams to hold back water as necessary. The concern, Bankes said, is that nobody knows exactly what an ad hoc regime will look like because it has never been done before. Currently, as I understand it, the dam operators start thinking about flood control operations in February, Bankes said. So, you need long leadups to be able to achieve target flows down in Washington and Oregon. That, I think, is the biggest issue, and obviously it should be a huge driver for the United States. What amazes me is that they havent got it figured out now, because 11 months is not a long time. The U.S. army Corps of Engineers, which built and operates the American treaty dam in Montana as well as a number of dams downriver in the Columbia River Basin such as the Bonneville Dam, warned Oregon and Washington residents in a September information session that waterflow may become unpredictable if Canada moves to an ad hoc regime. Development has proliferated on historical Columbia River flood plains in the United States since the treaty came into effect, and the Corps of Engineers said an ad hoc regime could lead to flooding and disruptions to transport corridors including the I5 bridge linking Oregon and Washington. At this point, we just simply dont know the actual changes in reservoir operations or potential changes in flooding, because we dont know how Canada will be operating their system, Geoff Van Epps, Commander of the U.S. army Corps of Engineers Northwest Division, told the information session. Speaking to West Kootenay residents with Conroy, Canadian treaty negotiator Stephen Gluck said while an ad hoc regime will give Canada more control over waterflow in theory, it also introduces uncertainty. I will say that even though we continue to negotiate, there is an emerging acceptance that a modernized treaty must include Canadian flexibility, Gluck said. Kathy Eichenberger, B.C.s lead negotiator, told residents the province received roughly 420 million last year in the Canadian entitlement from power generation at U.S. dams based on waterflows from Canada. Typically, the province receives about 150 million to 200 million a year, funding programs such as the Columbia Basin Trust that aids regions affected by the dams. Eichenberger said the dams also helped avert flooding in the B.C. communities of Trail and Castlegar in 2012. The key is, Canada and B.C., we entered into this treaty willingly, as partners with the United States, Eichenberger said. So, we are committed, as the U.S. is committed, to upholding to treaty requirements. For residents such as Youmans, however, it is beyond frustrating to see Washingtons Franklin D Roosevelt Lake downriver from the Canadian dams operating at normal water levels, while Arrow Lakes Reservoir recedes. Unfortunately, theres nothing we can do with whats happened now, Youmans said. All we can do is move forward and be heard on the upcoming and ongoing negotiations.

Otis arrival came just days after Hurricane Norma struck the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula to the north. AP writers Mark Stevenson in Chilpancingo, Mexico and Mara Verza in Mexico City contributed to this report.","By Jos Antonio Rivera And Mara Verza in Acapulco The Associated Press Hurricane Otis ripped through Mexicos southern Pacific coast early Wednesday as a powerful Category 5 storm, dousing steep mountains and leaving a trail of damage in Acapulco before weakening. Photos and video shared by local media after dawn broke in Acapulco showed the walls of buildings ripped off, flooded hotel rooms with collapsed ceilings, and rubble and downed trees lining the streets. Persistent rain and flooding made it difficult to move. Mexican President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador reported in a morning press briefing that the areas of Costa Grande, Acapulco and Tcpan in the state of Guerrero were all hit hard by Otis. He said the storm caused property damage, landslides and obstructed roads, but he had no information so far on whether Otis had claimed any lives. Communications with the area have been completely lost, Lpez Obrador said. The president added that damages to the local military airport has made it hard for authorities to access the region, and said highranking members of his government would travel to Guerrero to head up operations. By midmorning, Otis had weakened to a strong Category 2 storm and was about 88 miles 140 kilometers northnorthwest of Acapulco with its maximum sustained winds decreasing to 80 mph 130 kph and moving at 10 mph 17 kph. The storms center was expected to move farther inland over southern Mexico and dissipate by Wednesday night. Heavy rains between 4 and 8 inches 10 and 20 centimeters are expected to continue in southern Mexico through Thursday, which authorities said could spur on flooding and mudslides. A long convoy of trucks from the national electric company moved through the Guerrero state capital, Chilpancingo, before dawn Wednesday toward Acapulco. Otis had strengthened rapidly, going from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 12 hours Tuesday. Residents of Guerreros coast scrambled to prepare, but the storms sudden intensity appeared to catch many off guard. Were on maximum alert, Acapulco Mayor Abelina Lpez said Tuesday night as she urged residents to hunker down at home or move to the citys shelters. Videos from hotel guests in Acapulco posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, as the storm came ashore showed blinding horizontal rain and howling winds. In one, white towels danced high above a hotels cavernous courtyard like sheets of paper and bed mattresses trembled on balconies, apparently an effort to blunt the storms winds. Another showed wind and rain howling unimpeded down hotel hallways. While in still another, a family huddled inside a hotel room shower to escape breaking windows and fierce wind. Otis is stronger than Hurricane Pauline that hit Acapulco in 1997, Lpez said. Pauline destroyed swaths of the city and killed more than 200 people. Hundreds of others were injured in flooding and mudslides. Between the internationally known resorts of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo are two dozen small towns and villages. Otis arrival came just days after Hurricane Norma struck the southern tip of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula to the north. Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the citys hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. The city had opened two dozen shelters in the hours before Otis made landfall. Guerrero is one of Mexicos most impoverished and violent states. Just Monday, a local police chief and 12 police officers were massacred and found on a highway in El Papayo, which is in the Guerrero township of Coyuca de Benitez not far from Otis impact zone. In the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy moved northeast over open water with winds of 100 mph 155 kph after sweeping through the Lesser Antilles over the weekend. Tammy was about 540 miles 870 kilometers southsoutheast of Bermuda. The storm was expected to become a powerful extratropical cyclone by Thursday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

The effects of climate change are largely experienced at the community level and include public health implications, water supply and storm water issues, transportation system disruptions, power disruptions, impacts to public and private properties and landscapes, and increased andor urgent demand for social and emergency services. Consider Canadian disasters like the Calgary, AB flood in 2013, the western north American heat dome in 2021 that caused 11000year record high temperatures and forest fires and led to the destruction of Lytton BC, and multiple forest fires and evacuations across Canada over spring and summer 2023 these kinds of events are likely to occur more often due to climate change. How is the City preparing for climate change The City of Saskatoons Corporate Adaptation Strategy examines the impacts of climate change on our programs and services. A community adaptation strategy is planned for 2024 to address the risks to the whole community of Saskatoon. This table shows the highest corporate risks identified in the 2019 risk analysis The full risk analysis and the citys actions are set out in Local Actions Saskatoons Adaptation Strategy. While taking action to lower our emissions, the City is also proactively preparing itself to face climate impacts and mitigate risks to key infrastructure, programs and services posed by a warming climate and more frequent and intense storms. For instance, we have added a dry pond to the Churchill Park as a way to improve flood control. The goal of preparing for climate change is to achieve greater resilience such that people, neighbourhoods, businesses, and organizations can cope with current climate variability as well as adapt to future climate change, preserving the quality of life achieved through current development and minimizing damages. The climate is already changing People in Saskatoon are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. According to Climate West and the Prairie Climate Centre, the Prairies are warming faster than in the rest of Canada and the rest of the world. As Saskatoons climate continues to change, according to Climate West and Prairie Climate Centre we can expect More severe and more frequent storms Unpredictable rainfall increased drought in the summer and increased flooding as more of our rain falls in heavy storms More days with poor air quality as wildfires increase across Canada Weather whiplash increased sudden changes between hot and cold days, such as a rainy February day followed by extreme cold More very hot days in summer. Saskatoon is projected to move from 14 days above 30C every year historically to 28 days above 30C in the next 20 years and 47 days by 2060 Climate change will affect our daytoday lives and increase costs for people living in Saskatoon. Some of the impacts include Damage to roads and buildings from floods, storms, and temperature swings Increased demand for water and power systems could result in water restrictions or power outages Increased costs to cool homes and businesses in the summer Increased costs of insurance as storm and flood damage become more common Loss of trees from increased pests and droughts Changes to our outdoor recreation. This might mean longer summers for outdoor recreation, but also more days in the summer with extreme heat or poor air quality limiting how we spend time outdoors Increased heatrelated illness, respiratory problems from wildfire smoke, and new diseases moving north as the climate warms There are some potential benefits if we adapt and prepare for climate change, but those benefits could be outweighed by new challenges Longer growing seasons, but the benefits may be outweighed increased drought and storms Longer warm season for outdoor recreation, but the number of summer days with smoke and extreme heat will also increase, so we may have fewer days enjoying the outdoors Fewer winter days below 30, but with an increase in rain on snow, icy conditions, and winter storms The farming sector could see benefits from being able to grow different, potentially more valuable, crops but will also face increased pests and diseases, increased drought, and more frequent and severe storms including high winds and hail References and Resources",1

The early images and accounts were of extensive devastation, toppled trees and power lines lying in brown floodwaters that in some areas extended for miles. The resulting destruction delayed a comprehensive response by the government, which was still assessing the damage along Mexicos Pacific coast, and made residents desperate. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels in Acapulco looked like toothless, shattered hulks a day after the Category5 storm blew out hundreds and possibly thousands of windows. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. There seemed to be a widespread frustration with authorities. While some 10,000 military troops were deployed to the area, they lacked the tools to clean tons of mud and fallen trees from the streets. Hundreds of trucks from the government electricity company arrived in Acapulco early Wednesday, but seemed at a loss as to how to restore power, with downed electricity lines lying in feet of mud and water. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. We laid down on the floor, and some between beds, Sauczuk said. We prayed a lot. One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mass. Sauczuk complained that his group was given no warning, nor was offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he would die in his 13thstorey hotel room. I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held, said Navarro. But there were some room where the wind blew out the windows and the doors. Navarro stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flatscreen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts on to the mudchoked streets outside. OUT OF CONTROL This is out of control, he said. Isabel de la Cruz, a resident of Acapulco, tried to move a shopping cart loaded with diapers, instant noodles and toilet paper through the mud. She viewed what she took as a chance to help her family after she lost the tin roof of her home and her familys important documents in the hurricane. When is the government ever going to look after the common people she said. Inside one store, National Guard officers allowed looters to take perishable items like food, but made futile efforts to prevent people from taking appliances, even as people outside loaded refrigerators on top of taxis. It took nearly all day Wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting Acapulco to the state capital Chilpancingo and Mexico City. The vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. Acapulcos commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights. Acapulcos Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other lessflooded streets soldiers shovelled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. Wednesday night the city plunged into darkness. There was no phone service, but some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK.",1

Maries historic lighted cross is illuminated at dusk Wednesday as police hold the scene of a tragic intimate partner violence killing on Tancred Street. Kenneth ArmstrongSooToday A longtime social worker in Sault Ste. Marie is offering direction for families who may be struggling to help their kids cope with Monday nights shootings that claimed five lives, including three children aged 6, 7, and twelve. For the past 18 years, Kerri Dool has provided counselling services to residents of all ages. For nearly half that time, she has worked directly with students and young children in the Saults education system. While she recognizes this weeks incidents were incredibly violent, the support tactics her team members offer remains relatively the same. Any time we take a traumainformed approach to any crisis or serious incident, the guidelines are similar, Dool told SooToday. The most important thing to remember is the humanity in this, as well as the compassion and empathy we all need for those people who are struggling. Theres no linear movement through grief, she added. Its a process, and this is going to be a process of grieving that takes a very long time to overcome as a community. Realizing there are likely some parents in the community struggling to help their children cope with the tragedy, Dool says its important to check in with the little ones on a consistent basis. See what they already know about the tragedy, she suggested. Did the school share information Did they send a letter home that parents can reference with their children The grief counsellor noted that its okay to use direct language when talking about what happened this week, especially when the child is likely to hear about the devastating themes at school or in other places outside their household. Dont be afraid to say the children were killed. You dont have to be mysterious about what happened because I think your kids are going to hear that somewhere else anyway, she said. Its better to hear it in a safe environment where parents can provide support. During times of stress, Dool mentioned children may not function in the same capacity they normally do. But taking a trauma informed approach with them by lowering their fears and rationalizing their thoughts can go a long way, according to the experienced social worker. The fear response can become very heightened during a time like this, and you may even feel like theyre becoming paranoid of things that they didnt used to be aware of, she said. Asking them pointed questions like How often has your fear materialized in the past What are some things we can do to stay safe when you get worried about safety Those are ways we can help them switch over from that emotional response. Other tips Dool offered to parents include Have conversations about what intimate partner violence is and what healthy family relationships look like Use your own experience of death so kids know that we understand it Remind your children that its okay to cry and validate their emotions Reassure your kids by reviewing safety protocols your family may have in place at home Be aware of behavioural changes staying in their room, less socialization, not sleeping Model healthy coping as a parent, such as engaging in selfcare Check in with children on how theyre feeling physically butterflies in tummy, chest tightness, shortness of breath Take part in stressrelief exercises like deep breathing and meditation exercises on YouTube, Communicate with your childs support circle school, coaches, doctor, other parents In response to Mondays tragedy, Dool and her wellness team is offering a parent support group called Parenting Through Trauma. We really want to be there for our community right now, she said. We know that resources were stretched to begin with, and its hard for people to have access to services at times. We want to make sure people are resourced and supported. For families interested in the support group, or other options like parentdirect counselling and children and youth counselling, Dools team can be contacted by emailing email protected or by clicking here. Meanwhile, the Supportive Care Team at ARCH Hospice took to social media Wednesday afternoon to remind residents they also offer grief support for all ages. Our community has suffered immense loss within the last few months and this most recent tragedy has hit home for a lot of our community, their post stated. Please know that during this time, whatever you are feeling is okay. Grief is unique and very difficult to navigate. Be gentle with yourself and know that you are not alone. Grief Support at ARCH can be accessed by calling 7059421556 ext. 239 for children and youth Lana and ext. 242 for adults Laura. ARCH also offers online resources, and they are available by clicking here and here. Additionally, the nonprofit has a book titled The ABCs of Death for parents and caregivers on how to talk with children who may have questions about death, dying, or grief. ARCH will be hosting a series of workshops designed in coordination with the ABCs of Death book. The purpose of this workshop is to provide locals with practical tips and tools on how to Reflect on your own comfort with Death, Dying and Grief Talk to Children about Death and Dying Support a Child who is grieving Practice Self Care for the Caregiver The upcoming dates will be posted on ARCHs website for further information. Readers who would like a copy of the book can call Lana, or they can receive an ecopy by clicking here.

The damage caused by the climate crisis through extreme weather has cost 16 million 13 million an hour for the past 20 years, according to a new estimate. Storms, floods, heat waves and droughts have taken many lives and destroyed swathes of property in recent decades, with global heating making the events more frequent and intense. The study is the first to calculate a global figure for the increased costs directly attributable to humancaused global heating. It found average costs of 140 billion 115 billion a year from 2000 to 2019, although the figure varies significantly from year to year. The latest data shows 280 billion in costs in 2022. The researchers said lack of data, particularly in lowincome countries, meant the figures were likely to be seriously underestimated. Additional climate costs, such as from crop yield declines and sea level rise, were also not included. The researchers produced the estimates by combining data on how much global heating worsened extreme weather events with economic data on losses. The study also found that the number of people affected by extreme weather because of the climate crisis was 1.2 billion over two decades. Twothirds of the damage costs were due to the lives lost, while a third was due to property and other assets being destroyed. Storms, such as hurricane Harvey and cyclone Nargis, were responsible for twothirds of the climate costs, with 16 per cent from heat waves and 10 per cent from floods and droughts. Texas National Guard soldiers arrive in Houston, Texas to aid citizens in heavily flooded areas from the storms of hurricane Harvey. Storms are responsible for twothirds of the climate costs.

Zachary West, 100th MPADTexas Military DepartmentFlickr CC BYND 2.0 Deed Ontario plunges 1.3M into Lake Simcoe cleanup The researchers said their methods could be used to calculate how much funding was needed for a loss and damage fund established at the UNs climate summit in 2022, which is intended to pay for the recovery from extreme weather disasters in poorer countries. It could also rapidly determine the specific climate cost of individual disasters, enabling faster delivery of funds. The headline number is 140 billion a year and, first of all, thats already a big number, said Prof. Ilan Noy at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, who carried out the study with colleague Rebecca Newman. Second, when you compare it to the standard quantification of the cost of climate change using computer models, it seems those quantifications are underestimating the impact of climate change. The climate crisis is costing 16 million an hour in extreme weather damage, study estimates. ClimateCrisis ExtremeWeather Hurricanes Flooding Drought Noy said there were a lot of extreme weather events for which there was no data on the number of people killed or economic damage That indicates our headline number of 140 billion is a significant understatement. For example, he said, heat wave death data was only available in Europe. We have no idea how many people died from heat waves in all of subSaharan Africa. Extreme weather Glacial flooding, wildfires and hailstorms cause havoc across the world. There has been a sevenfold increase in reported losses from extreme weather disasters since the 1970s, according to the World Meteorological Organization. However, separating the effect of global heating from population growth, urban migration and better reporting of disasters is difficult. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, took a different approach based on how climate change had exacerbated extreme weather events. Hundreds of attribution studies have been done, calculating how much more frequent global heating made extreme weather events. This allows the fraction of the damages resulting from humancaused heating to be estimated. The researchers applied these fractions to the damages recorded in the International Disaster Database, which compiles available data on all disasters in which 10 people died, or 100 were affected, or the country declared a state of emergency or requested international assistance. The central estimate was an average climate cost of 140 billion a year, with a range from 60 billion to 230 billion. These estimates are much higher than those from computer models, which are based on changes in average global temperature rather than on the extreme temperatures increasingly being seen in the world.",1

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. APs earlier story follows below. ACAPULCO, Mexico AP A day after Hurricane Otis roared ashore in Acapulco, unleashing massive floods and setting off looting, the resort city of nearly 1 million descended into chaos, leaving residents without electricity or internet service as the toll remained uncertain. The early images and accounts were of extensive devastation, toppled trees and power lines lying in brown floodwaters that in some areas extended for miles. The resulting destruction delayed a comprehensive response by the government, which was still assessing the damage along Mexicos Pacific coast, and made residents desperate. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels in Acapulco looked like toothless, shattered hulks a day after the Category 5 storm blew out hundreds and possibly thousands of windows. There seemed to be a widespread frustration with authorities. While some 10,000 military troops were deployed to the area, they lacked the tools to clean tons of mud and fallen trees from the streets. Hundreds of trucks from the government electricity company arrived in Acapulco early Wednesday, but seemed at a loss as to how to restore power, with downed electricity lines lying in feet of mud and water. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. We laid down on the floor, and some between beds, Sauczuk said. We prayed a lot. One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mass. Sauczuk complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beach front hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held, said Navarro. But there were some room where the wind blew out the windows and the doors. Navarro stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mudchoked streets outside. This is out of control, he said. Isabel de la Cruz, a resident of Acapulco, tried to move a shopping cart loaded with diapers, instant noodles and toilet paper through the mud. She viewed what she took as a chance to help her family after she lost the tin roof of her home and her familys important documents in the hurricane. When is the government ever going to look after the common people she said. Inside one store, National Guard officers allowed looters to take perishable items like food, but made futile efforts to prevent people from taking appliances, even as people outside loaded refrigerators on top of taxis. It took nearly all day Wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting Acapulco to the state capital Chilpancingo and Mexico City. The vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. Acapulcos commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights. Acapulcos Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other lessflooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. Wednesday night the city plunged into darkness. There was no phone service, but some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK. Alicia Galindo, a 28yearold stylist in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potosi, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. Her parents and brother were staying in Acapulcos Hotel Princess for an international mining conference when Otis hit early Wednesday with 165 mph 270 kmh winds. They told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down until everything was gone, she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. However, Galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Its one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when youre expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when youre not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, Mexican President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador said Wednesday morning. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been completely lost. Later Wednesday, Milenio TV circulated photos of Lpez Obrador trying to make it to Acapulco by ground, in some places getting out to walk. It was not immediately clear if he made it. Acapulco is at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific Ocean. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, the port has in recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Lpez Obrador noted that Otis was a stronger hurricane than Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people. Verza reported from Mexico City.

S. Columbia River Treaty as B.C. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver.","Victoria Youmans says she hasnt seen Arrow Lakes Reservoir looking so low in more than 20 years. The resident of Nakusp on the shores of the reservoir in British Columbias southern Interior says shes seen thousands of dead fish on the shore, and the receding waterline means boat access has been cut to waterfront properties. Instead of lapping waters, some homes now face an expanse of sucking quicksand. Drought is part of reason. But so too is the Columbia River Treaty with the United States that obligates B.C. to direct water from the reservoir across the border at American behest. The grim scenes described by Youmans illustrate the stakes in ongoing talks between Canadian and U.S. negotiators to modernize the 62yearold treaty, as the increased risk of extreme weather weighs on both sides. Part of the treaty that gives the United States direct control over a portion of the water in Arrow Lakes Reservoir and two other B.C. dams is set to expire in September 2024. I would say that when it was negotiated in 1961 and entered into force in 1964, it probably was one of the most important if not the most important water treaties in the world, said Nigel Bankes, professor emeritus at the University of Calgarys Faculty of Law, whose expertise includes the Columbia River Treaty. Its significance was really that it provided for the cooperative development of the Columbia River the cooperative development of storage for flood control and power purposes, and for a sharing of the benefits associated with those developments. The treaty was forged after catastrophic flooding of the Columbia River in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, Ore., near Portland. Hydro plan helps Quebec rise to the climate challenge and stay competitive It led to the creation of three dams in B.C. and a fourth in Montana in the Columbias drainage basin, serving both flood control and hydropower generation. But recent extreme weather such as this years severe drought in B.C. has exposed problems in the agreement that residents of the Columbia River Basin say need to be urgently addressed. Drought reveals cracks in CanadaU. S. Columbia River Treaty as B.C. lake dries up. BC ColumbiaRiverTreaty The 230kilometrelong Arrow Lakes Reservoir made up of Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake was created when the Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in 1968 under the treaty. The reservoirs water level had fallen to 423.7 metres above sea level on Tuesday a low not reached in more than two decades. Nakusp resident Youmans said whats even more concerning is that its only October, and the lakes usually dont reach their lowest annual levels until late winter or early spring. I personally have never seen it this low, and Ive lived here for over 20 years, said Youmans, who is among 3,900 members of a Facebook group that wants to slow the flow of Arrow Lakes to the United States. She says the low water levels are hampering tourism and recreation on the lake, located about 600 km east of Vancouver. There are other commercial concerns. Nakusp Mayor Tom Zeleznik said low water levels had rendered parts of the reservoir unnavigable for vessels carrying logs, resulting in the closure of some businesses, and forcing reliance on costlier land transport. Katrine Conroy, the provincial minister on the Columbia River Treaty file and the MLA representing Kootenay West, said the province is legally obligated by the treaty to direct water to the United States for flood protection, powergeneration purposes, as well as for fish.",1

It looked at the amount of trees weve lost, the effect on wildlife and the hydrological integrity we lost from harvesting. Harvesting policies that aim to maintain biodiversity and protect wildlife will help mitigate builtup fuel from fallen trees and provide food and shelter for wildlife.","Liberal MLA Morris guest speaker at Kettle Valley Wildlife Hall meeting More than a century of focusing on lumber value over supporting the environment is coming back to bite B.C., but there is still hope governments and the industry can apply sustainable practices. The Kettle Valley Wildlife Hall was packed with residents from the Boundary Region, dignitaries and guest speakers to talk about wildlife resources in critical danger after generations of what guest speaker BC Liberal Caucus MLA for Prince GeorgeMackenzie Mike Morris said is not seeing the forest for the trees. He was among other guest speakers talking about everything from recent wildfires, declining wildlife populations, atmospheric rivers, flooding and the solutions that could help at least mitigate extreme weather as climate change progresses. Morris has been working on changing provincial natural resource management policies for the past 20 years, with a highlight being a 2015 government report Getting the Balance Right Improving Wildlife Habitat Management in BC. Ive been an environmentalist and always will be, Morris said in later comments. Barry Brandow had contacted me a while ago on this and that was a very good turnout for the area. He explained hes had a lifelong passion for environmental stewardship. When Christy Clark was Premier, she appointed Morris as parliamentary secretary with a sole focus on wildlife habitat. During that time, he studied the provinces resource management, where it was right now and where it is headed. Even then, he said he saw many of the warning signs of disasters happening today, like giant wildfires and more violent storms, as well as droughts and watersheds losing their ability to maintain moisture levels. Also during that time, he wrote an internal paper that was leaked, titled You Cant See the Forest for the Trees looking at the centurylong history of the forestry industrys management of the provinces timber stands. Many of the problems stem from longoutdated policies that no longer fit the reality of lumber harvesting, he said. I really wanted to see why there was this myopic focus on the growth and yield of a tree, he said. It looked at the amount of trees weve lost, the effect on wildlife and the hydrological integrity we lost from harvesting. That led to wildfires and droughts and floods. Its the genesis of the discussion we had in Rock Creek. His paper looked at every Royal Commission on the forestry industry from 1910 to today and he found much of the provinces timber harvest is still based on 1945s commission on sustainable yields, when it was believed B.Cs forest would last essentially forever. Back then, there was no concern for loss of trees because it was believed there were so many it would never compromise the other ecosystems in the forests. This was all based on technology and harvesting practices from the 1930s. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the thenprovincial governments modernized the logging industry with the same myopic view, Morris said. We turbocharged the industry. We went from fiveaxle trucks to 10axle trucks, he said. We had milliondollar fellerbunchers that could do the work of 20 men. We have sawmills that can consume 2 million or more cubic metres, when 30 or 40 years ago they consumed 100,000 or 200,000 cubic metres. This has led to 30 million hectares harvested and replanted with monoculture seedlings that do little to restore the lands or fully support biodiversity, he said. While changing how forests are managed in B.C. may not help level out climate change globally, it will help the provinces forests cope better with sudden events, like floods and fires. With fires, he said better policies around managing watersheds would help keep moisture in the ground so they wont burn as intensely as they do now. Harvesting policies that aim to maintain biodiversity and protect wildlife will help mitigate builtup fuel from fallen trees and provide food and shelter for wildlife. While unhappy its taken years of physical damage to get his colleagues and industry leaders to pay attention, Morris said hes not going to stop, even after he leaves political office. Right now hes continuing to push for changes and is encouraging colleagues to join advisory boards to learn more and bring their influence to foster changes between business and in the Legislature.",1

The Kamloops Emergency Support Services team has once again stepped up to support residents from neighbouring communities that were impacted by floods or fires and needed to evacuate their communities, Will Beatty, the citys emergency preparedness manager, said last week during a meeting of Kamloops city councillors and Tkemlups chief and council. Beatty said the reception centre, operated by more than 100 volunteers and staff members, was opened a few times this year to support thousands of people evacuated due to floods and fires. On Aug. 17, in response to various surrounding communities being placed under evacuation orders, the reception centre reopened and remained open until Sept. 22, he said. During this time, the team supported over 3,500 evacuees. The reception centre remained open almost every day during the fiveweek operation. The ESS centre was first opened on May 3 after Cache Creek spilled its banks, resulting in what village officials referred to as the worst damage ever caused by the creek. Beatty said about 47 volunteers helped more than 130 flooding evacuees. The ESS centre remained open until May 25. The centre was activated again on July 17 in response to the Rossmoore Lake, Casper Creek and Downton Lake wildfires. The ESS reception centre was once again open for a week to support approximately 100 evacuees from the Rossmoore fire, Casper Creek and Downton Lake fires, Beatty said. The ESS team continue to provide services to evacuees from these areas on an oncall basis for the remainder of July and beginning of August. Shane Wardrobe, emergency coordinating planner for Tkemlups te Secwepemc, said the band was happy to be supported by the City of Kamloops ESS to help register evacuees and send people their way when wildfires took off. For us, it was Aug. 18 when the fires from Adams Lake swept into Squilax, Lee Creek, Scotch Creek and the Celista area, Wardrobe said. He noted the band looked after about 200 evacuees at the Powwow Arbour and the Tselletkwe Lodge an evacuation camp set up in Rayleigh through a partnership with TteS and the provincial ministry of emergency management and climate readiness. TteS Coun. Justin Gottfriedson said he believes there was gold star collaboration between the two communities on emergency response. I would be remiss not to mention that the collaboration between our two communities did start at one of these community to community forums, where we decided to be incredibly pragmatic to pool our resources, our skill sets and our experiences, Gottfriedson said.

La journe de la Fiert en ducation et le flot de courriels qui a suivi taient le catalyseur parfait que recherchait le ministre de lducation.,"FREDERICTON Dans les semaines qui ont prcd la dcision du gouvernement du NouveauBrunswick de modifier sa politique sur lorientation sexuelle et lidentit de genre dans les coles, il a reu un dluge de courriels et dautres communications critiquant les directives. Une demande daccs linformation de La Presse Canadienne auprs du ministre de lducation sollicitant toutes les plaintes concernant la politique 713 depuis aot 2020, date de sa cration jusqu la fin mai 2023 a produit prs de 600 pages de courriels, de lettres, denregistrements tlphoniques et dautres notes. Les noms des personnes qui ont crit ont t caviards pour des raisons de confidentialit. La politique 713 tablissait des normes pour rendre les coles sres et inclusives pour les lves LGBTQ. Selon la politique, un directeur consulterait les tudiants de moins de 16 ans qui souhaitent modifier le prnom quil prfre avant de lutiliser pour des rapports ou la tenue de dossiers. Elle garantit que tous les lves pourront participer des activits scolaires et parascolaires qui sont sres, accueillantes et conformes leur identit de genre. Et elle stipule que tous les tudiants devraient avoir accs des toilettes qui correspondent leur identit de genre. La demande daccs linformation montre quil ny a eu que quatre courriels protestant contre cette politique avant quune publicit napparaisse pour une journe de la Fiert en ducation pour les enseignants du primaire et du secondaire, qui a eu lieu le 5 mai de cette anne. Pour tre clair, je ne suis pas contre la politique et je vois en quoi elle peut tre bnfique, a dclar lun dentre eux au premier ministre Blaine Higgs, le 16 janvier 2021. Jai simplement des inquitudes concernant certains aspects qui vont trop loin et porter atteinte aux droits et croyances dautrui qui leur sont prcieux. Cependant, les registres montrent une inondation de communication aprs la diffusion de lannonce de lvnement de la Fiert, qui faisait la promotion de sujets tels que lducation sexuelle queer, le programme inclusif de la maternelle la 12e anne, lheure du conte drag et la scurit personnelle des ducateurs. Gail Costello, ancienne coprsidente de lorganisme Pride in Education, a dclar que ctait la premire fois que le groupe de dfense LGBTQ dirigeait une confrence pour les enseignants. Un lecteur a envoy une lettre la dpute progressisteconservatrice Mary Wilson le 24 avril. Mme Wilson, qui a t nomme au cabinet en juin, a transmis le courriel M. Higgs, dcrivant lauteur comme un ami et un lecteur dont je peux me porter garant 100 . Lami a abord la journe de la Fiert en ducation avant de faire mention dun mythe urbain propag par les militants antitrans. Savezvous quil y a des coles au NouveauBrunswick qui fournissent de la litire pour chats aux enfants qui sidentifient comme chats, a crit la personne. Il sagit de maltraitance denfants, et les adultes qui soutiennent cela devraient tre dmis de leurs fonctions. Interroge sur la lettre cette semaine, Mme Wilson a dclar dans un communiqu quelle recevait de nombreux courriels dlecteurs sur divers sujets. Conformment mon processus de correspondance habituel, le courriel auquel vous faites rfrence a t transmis la personne approprie au nom dun lecteur et ne reflte pas mes opinions, atelle affirm dans le communiqu. Je peux vous informer quil ny a pas de bacs litire pour chats dans nos coles du NouveauBrunswick. Mme Wilson a transmis un courriel qui abonde dans le mme sens dun autre lecteur le 9 mai trois personnes, dont le ministre de lducation Bill Hogan. Les droits de la personne au cur du dbat Plusieurs enseignants ont galement crit pour demander des modifications la politique 713. Un courriel du 9 mai dune enseignante et dune mre a flicit M. Hogan pour avoir annonc une rvision de la politique. Elle sest oppose lexigence selon laquelle le directeur doit obtenir le consentement de llve avant de parler au parent du nom prfr de lenfant. En tant quenseignante, je ne suis pas laise avec lide dutiliser le nom que prfre un lve sans la permission des parents, atelle dclar. En tant que mre, je ne voudrais pas quun enseignant appelle mes enfants par un autre nom simplement parce que mon enfant le demande. Elle a galement dit ne pas tre laise avec lide que des tudiants utilisent des toilettes qui correspondent leur identit de genre. LAssociation canadienne des liberts civiles a dpos le mois dernier une action en justice visant annuler des aspects cls de la politique. Elle affirme que la politique 713 originale tait conforme aux lignes directrices en matire de pdiatrie et dducation, et que le fait de ne pas affirmer lidentit dun lve LGBTQ peut entraner des rsultats ngatifs en matire dducation et de sant, notamment un risque accru de dpression, danxit, de troubles de lalimentation, dautomutilation et de suicide. Les changements apports cette politique, entrs en vigueur le 1er juillet, signifient quil nest plus obligatoire pour les enseignants dutiliser les pronoms ou les noms que prfrent les lves transgenres ou non binaires gs de moins de 16 ans. La disposition qui permettait aux lves de participer des activits extrascolaires conformes leur identit de genre a t supprime, de mme que lengagement de fournir des vestiaires privs et universels dans toutes les coles de la province. Les changements ont t examins par le dfenseur des enfants, des jeunes et des ans du NouveauBrunswick, Kelly Lamrock. Il a indiqu quils violaient la Loi sur les droits de la personne du NouveauBrunswick ainsi que les droits des enfants garantis par la Charte. Selon Mme Costello, les changements apports la politique refltent une influence amricaine. Si vous regardez la Floride la Floride a commenc par sen prendre aux enfants trans et en supprimant les politiques visant les protger, exactement comme le font Bill Hogan et Blaine Higgs, atelle dclar. La journe de la Fiert en ducation et le flot de courriels qui a suivi taient le catalyseur parfait que recherchait le ministre de lducation.",1

What is a zombie tree A zombie tree is a tree that appeared undamaged immediately after a storm or drought, but is now beginning to display symptoms of distress. Root problems check if the soil near the trees base is lifting on one side. Zombie trees are a hazardbut unlike their namesake, they dont have to cause fear and panic.","1 of 2 2 of 2 By Scott Gardner When a severe storm strikes, immediate visible damage often includes downed power lines and flooding. Yet, what may surprise some is that the full impact of storms can remain concealed within trees for an extended period. These trees, harboring hidden damage, are occasionally dubbed zombie trees. Much like the zombies in horror films, these trees have the potential to inflict substantial harm if not detected early. Fortunately, there are methods to identify the warning signs. What is a zombie tree A zombie tree is a tree that appeared undamaged immediately after a storm or drought, but is now beginning to display symptoms of distress. While some of these trees might be salvageable, others could be deteriorating from within and necessitate removal. The deceptive aspect of zombie trees lies in their ability to appear safe in the days immediately following a storm or significant weather event, potentially posing a hidden threat to unaware property owners. Photo via Davey Tree Expert Co. of Canada Ltd. How to spot a zombie tree Dead wood or decay dead trees or large, dead branches can fall at any time. Cracks deep splits through the bark that extend into the wood of the trees trunk or limbs. Heavy canopies excessively thick branches and foliage catch more wind during stormy weather. This increases the risk of branch breakage and uprooting. Discolored foliage heavy flooding will cause leaves to wilt or dieback early. Root problems check if the soil near the trees base is lifting on one side. If construction has occurred nearby, closely examine that area of the tree. Nearby construction may sever large roots or compact the soil, reducing root growth. Without a strong root system, trees are more likely to be uprooted or blown over in storms. Poor tree architecture excessive leaning of the tree or branches growing out of proportion with the rest of the tree crown. Odd growth patterns may indicate general weakness or structural imbalance. What to do about zombie trees Identify issues early to prevent damage before it happens with a home tree health check. With early action, you may be able to save a tree. Walk around the yard, inspecting trees for dead wood or decay, cracks in the bark that extend into the trees trunk or limbs, discolored foliage, and root and architecture problems. Is the tree lifting on one side or leaning excessively That could be a sign of trouble. Get an expert opinion. If you notice any issues during the tree health check, call a certified arborist. Certified arborists can address problems visible to the naked eyeplus damage you may not be aware ofand help you decide on a plan of action. Homeowners should always check for TCIA Accreditation, ISA Certification, proof of insurance, WorkSafe BC coverage, and a list of references when hiring a certified arborist. Know your options. Although defective trees are dangerous, not all of them need to be removed immediately. First, understand a trees risk level. Some defects can be addressed to prolong the life of the tree, and some of the care and maintenance can be done by homeowners. Important tree maintenance tips include fertilizing, planting suitable trees and shrubs for our local climate, and proper pruning. Zombie trees are a hazardbut unlike their namesake, they dont have to cause fear and panic. By giving your trees the attention they need, you wont have to worry about your yard turning into a scene from The Walking Dead.

Teaching Wildlife Biology and Management, Cull and his second year Fish and Wildlife students will be collecting biological data on whitetailed deer harvested on St. Joseph Island Wildlife Management Unit 45 and the mainland Wildlife Management Unit 36 in November. The idea is to get as large a sample size as we can, he said. The bigger the sample size, the better the data. Harvest data includes deer weights, age, sex, antler beam diameter, number of points, condition of deer and general location of harvest. Cull says this information will be shared with the local Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry biologist and will assist in setting the 2024 Deer Harvest Quota allocation for those Wildlife Management Units. Youre getting added value information you wouldnt necessarily get, he told SooToday. MNRF will look at the harvest data and decide if there are some trends in the population. If they think theres a decline, they can curtail some of that harvesting to try and rebuild that population. Some of the hunters are starting to say theyve seen an increase in the deer population on the island, he added. Now, we can try and back that up with the data weve got. Cull noted that the ministry can also use the data to find out more about their nutritional status and the condition that the deer are in. By taking those measurements at a deer check station, were getting more information for St. Joseph Island and for the mainland, he said. It makes the hunters feel good too. They have a chance to find out whats going on with the local herd and get an update on the trends were starting to notice. While the project provides college professors and students with the chance to talk to hunters about the status of the local deer herds on the island and the mainland, Cull explains its also an excellent opportunity for students to obtain handson wildlife management work experience. Its a great handson project for them, he said. They can put that work on their resumes and can go into an interview saying they have handson experience dealing with hunters coming in, collecting biological information, and summarizing and presenting that data to a local game and fish club. During the weeklong check station, random prizes will be drawn for fawn, adult doe, and adult buck categories thanks to the excellent partners at the St. Joseph Island Hunters and Anglers Association and the Algoma Fish and Game Club, according to Cull. The college instructor hopes to engage upwards of 200 hunters by inviting them to the deer check station at Reesers Restaurant on St. Joseph Island with their harvested deer in November.

When vaccines against COVID19 first became available in Canada, public service announcements flooded radio and TV broadcasts and repeatedly popped up online and across social media feeds. More than 80 per cent of people in Canada responded, lining up at mass vaccination clinics or booking appointments for their first two doses. Federal, provincial and territorial governments public awareness campaigns continued over the next few years, actively promoting booster shots to protect against waning immunity but the uptake was considerably lower. Now, there are two new COVID19 vaccines reformulated by PfizerBioNTech and Moderna to fight the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant that has become dominant across the country. Yet despite the fact every province and territory now has at least one updated mRNA vaccine in hand, some experts say public awareness efforts to drive vaccine uptake arent what they used to be. Doctors say its vital to get this version of the vaccine because it offers protection against the subvariant driving a current rise in COVID19 cases and also because most Canadians are well past the sixmonth mark when immunity fades after previous shots or infections. It seems to me that we are sort of experiencing COVID amnesia, said Dr. Nazeem Muhajarine, professor of community health and epidemiology at the University of Saskatchewan. Overall, communications efforts to break through that amnesia and get across the importance of getting the vaccine have been less than optimal, he said. This fall, we are at a quite a different place in relation to COVID19 than in each of the three previous falls we are in a better place, but we are not in a completely safe place, said Muhajarine, who is also a researcher with Canadas Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network. Provinces and territories now have information posted on their websites about who is eligible to get the updated COVID19 vaccine, where to get it and links to book appointments or find participating pharmacies. But those websites require people to already be motivated to seek out a shot, Muhajarine said. British Columbias system is an example of a more proactive approach, he said. Everyone in B.C. who got their primary COVID19 vaccine series gets a text or email message informing them when its their turn to get the new shot, the provinces Health Minister Adrian Dix told The Canadian Press in an interview. People can click through to book their appointment immediately, Dix said, noting that the message also reminds them to get their flu shot, which can be booked at the same time. The invitations to book have been sent out in order of vulnerability, he said, with the first messages going to healthcare workers and longterm care residents, followed by seniors and people who have chronic conditions that make them especially vulnerable to serious illness. After that, the general public has startedreceiving invitations. Dix estimated that about 144,000 invitations for COVID19 and flu vaccinations are sent out per day in B.C. The minister didnt comment on whether the budget for advertising and promoting the COVID19 vaccine was similar to previous efforts, but said the text and email messages are an invitation system which serve as the best possible promotion. In an email response to The Canadian Press, the Public Health Agency of Canada said that provincial and territorial governments are responsible for their own advertising campaigns to promote vaccines. But the agency said it is also promoting the updated COVID19 vaccine at a national level as part of three sequenced advertising campaigns this season, one on COVID19 vaccination, one on seasonal flu and one on personal protective measures.Its strategy also includes news media outreach, social media campaigns and webinars with healthcare professionals. The agency acknowledged that the overall advertising budget has decreased in 202324 but said its campaigns are increasingly more targeted to higher risk individuals. Local public health units are doing the best they can to increase awareness of the updated COVID19 vaccine within limited budgets set by provinces and municipalities, said Dr. Thomas Piggott, medical officer of health for Peterborough, Ont. Piggott and his team are doing both traditional media and social media promotion, including Instagram live sessions where he answers peoples questions about COVID19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus RSV and available vaccines. Capacity continues to be a challenge because public health continues to be grossly underfunded in comparison to other parts of, you know, public service and the healthcare system, he said, noting theres no word if the additional COVID19 funding given to public health units during the pandemic will continue past the end of this year. Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health, said they continue to do paid advertising as well as media relations campaigns, but theres no question that I think people need to hear it many different ways ... in order to get the message to sink in. Toronto Public Health no longer has the same largescale infrastructure of community ambassadors to reach marginalized neighbourhoods and people who speak different languages that it had during previous COVID19 vaccine awareness campaigns, Dubey said. It also has fewer peopleto workon vaccine confidence teams who would disseminate accurate information about COVID19 vaccination and combat the flow of misinformation on social media, she said. Ensuring people understand the importance of this falls COVID19 vaccine is not just about the amount of promotion its also about describing the shot accurately, Muhajarine said. Calling the XBB.1.5 vaccine a booster is not scientifically accurate and may lead people to underestimate its significance, he said. It is not a booster dose. It is a new vaccine reformulation, Muhajarine said. We are not trying to boost previous vaccine doses, he said. We are trying to elicit an immune response to this current circulating variant. We dont say each year, Get your flu booster. We say, Get your flu vaccine. Dubey agreed. When you hear the word booster you might think, oh well, I already got a bunch of vaccines, Im good, she said. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that everyone six months of age and older get the XBB.1.5 vaccine if it has been six months or longer since their last COVID19 vaccination or COVID19 infection. NACI also recommends the XBB.1.5 vaccine for both children and adults who have never been vaccinated against COVID19. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 29, 2023.

The baby, known as a kit, is believed to be the first to be born in the area in hundreds of years. We didnt have eyes on the female beaver, so we were a bit concerned, said Meg Wilson, animal collections manager for Capel Manor College, one of the groups leading Londons first beaver reintroduction program. That concern turned to excitement two weeks later when the female appeared again on camera with swollen teats, an obvious sign of feeding, Wilson said. We had an inkling that she might have had a baby and we just hadnt seen it yet and then thats when we found the little one swimming around with the adults, Wilson told the CBC in a phone interview, with a smile in her voice.

Back from nearextinction Unlike in Canada, where the species is thriving and its population is estimated in the millions, beavers in Britain number in the low thousands, with likely only around 500 in England. Hunted to nearextinction during Elizabethan times, there is now a concerted effort to bring beavers back to Britain for the benefits they offer in flood management, water quality and fostering biodiversity. Flood defence is precisely why Wilson and her team applied to set up a beaver enclosure in Enfield, a town on the northern border of Greater London. A bonded pair of beavers were relocated from Scotland in December 2022 and have since created a wetland that almost one metre deeper than what previously existed. They havent even been here a whole year yet and and theyre already doing great things shaping the landscape into a much better, more productive area, said Wilson. Image 1729356568 Caption There are concerted efforts in England to bring beavers back to the landscape, including this beaver, part of a family of five that was released into a west London reserve in October. Dan KitwoodGetty Images Load Image What happened to the beaver Castor fiber, or the Eurasian beaver, is no stranger to this side of the Atlantic. Fossil evidence indicates beavers lived across most of Europe and parts of Asia 10,000 years ago until an appetite for their meat and fur brought them to the brink of extinction by the 1500s. While some European countries like Sweden, Germany, and Austria began their beaver reintroduction programs in the 20th century, efforts in the U.K. didnt get underway until 2009. Thats when the Scottish government launched a trial to monitor the effects of the animal on its ecosystem and released 15 beavers into the west coast of Scotland. The long absence of natures engineers has been felt across Britain. Nature in this country is pretty depleted and really needs help to recover, said Richard Brazier, a University of Exeter professor and director of a research centre that focuses on environmental resilience which often includes research he calls beaverology. Image clinton devon estate Caption The U.K. continues to be plagued with recordbreaking hot and dry summers. Drone photography of the Clinton Devon Estates in southwest England has shown how the presence of beavers has helped to preserve the land in times of drought. Clinton Devon Estates Load Image When the beavers are living in a landscape, they support the structure of that ecosystem, said Brazier. Brazier describes the worlds secondlargest rodent as a keystone species. When they are introduced to intensively farmed and drained landscapes, they can facilitate an increase in water levels, which in turn fosters life of a multitude of different species, he said. The benefits these ecological foot soldiers afford does not stop at biodiversity. A 2021 study of the western United States showed beaver dams can also improve the fire resistance of a landscape and offer sanctuary for species like fish, amphibians or birds that cannot physically escape during a wildfire. Despite this evidence, not everyone in Britain is on board with beaver reintroduction. 95 good, 5 bad It is illegal to release beavers into the wild in England and a special licence is required to keep them in enclosures. One of the groups most invested in this legislation is farmers. Richard Bramley, who chairs the environment forum of the National Farmers Union, said in an email to CBC that many farmers are concerned about the negative impacts from flooding to felling trees to eating crops that beavers could have on their land. But there are ways to help mitigate those concerns, said Alastair Driver, director of Rewilding Britain, a charity committed to increasing biodiversity across England, Scotland and Wales. Beavers are 95 per cent good and five per cent bad when it comes to a human perspective, said Driver. There are things they do that we might not like, he said. But we know how to deal with that. Driver said there are physical solutions, like the installation of beaver deceiver pipes that allow water to drain through a dam and prevent flooding. He also said there are subsidies for farmers whose crops have been eaten so they dont bear the financial burden of accepting beavers on their land. Image Alastair Driver Caption Alastair Driver is the director of Rewilding Britain, a charity committed to increasing biodiversity across England, Scotland and Wales. Submitted by Alastair Driver Load Image Driver said the true financial burden has been borne by the government after decades of not employing these natural irrigation experts. Over my career, I spent millions of pounds restoring rivers. Beavers do it for free, he said. The U.K. government is planning to spend 5.2 billion about 8.7 billion Cdn over the next six years on flood and coastal erosion risk management. Driver said the reintroduction of beavers is a nobrainer that will benefit society as a whole. But it is being held up at the highest level. Not a priority A major requirement in allowing beavers to be reintroduced into the English wilderness is signoff from Thrse Coffey, the U.K.s secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs. Recently, the minister told a committee of MPs that species reintroduction is simply not a priority for this administration. Many of the ecologists and campaigners who have been busy as the animals theyre trying to reintroduce vehemently disagree. It is a priority, Driver said, referring to the 30 by 30 initiative that the U.K. government signed, along with numerous countries around the world including Canada. The initiative has a goal to protect and restore 30 per cent of its land by 2030. It wont do that in the river and the wetland world without beavers back in the landscape, said Driver.

It is one of approximately 27 beaver enclosures of its kind around the country. MayorofLondonTwitter Load Image Living better with nature There is still hope for these wetland warriors who live in 27 enclosures across England, each of which, according to Driver, is a step in the right direction. There isnt a single beaver enclosure in the country that hasnt won over more people because they see what the beavers can do in that location.

Amongst the unstoppable changing world, the chaos, the growth, the loss, the laughter, and tears there came to a point where I couldnt breathe. I felt as though I was drowning. I went out to the levee on the Mississippi River by my mothers house and walked with my camera. Photographer Adrianna Ault was raised in New Orleans where a 350 mile levee system controls and holds back flood waters. This project began as Ault attempted to better understand the landscape surrounding the city, but evolved over the course of 5years to encompass her changing family, journeys they took and the processing of grief. The levee became a metaphor for the barriers built in an attempt to ward off inevitable decline, and the onslaught of time and nature. I discovered how the surrounding citys waterways exposed the land to a constant state of vulnerability. The physical landscape is parallel to an emotional landscape rooted within the culture of New Orleans and its people. Ault began photographing the project in 2017 and the final images in this new book were made in 2022. Alongside photographs of the landscape of New Orleans and the Hudson Valley, she photographed her children, and her mothers final car journey from Rhinebeck, NY to her mothers home in New Orleans, LA. The act of making photographs allowed Ault to see and process the world in a different way, with a quietness and slownessand in this she found sanctuary. Making pictures in this place was not outside of the pain of losing my mother or the joy and wild ride of being one, rather it was beyond it. It is a quiet place to rest and feel the heartsinking loss and what is found along the way. You find ways to stay busy. Flicking stones, throwing scraps of jerky to the dogs from the porch. Church dinners, oil changes, doctors visits. You stay aloft as long as you can. Devices to hold things in place when it does come plywood cut to fit the windows, gaskets to seal the bottoms of the doors, jugs of clear water stashed in the attic. Not that it matters much. You plan allout for one disaster and you miss another disaster entirely. You plan for the hurricane and its black mold that takes your house.

The Nelson Daily photo Tuesday is the day when ghosts and goblins take to the street to trickortreat and get into that haunted spirit on Halloween. Local police will be out patrolling in and around the Heritage City looking for any suspicious activity as youngsters accompanied by adults flood the neighbourhoods looking for treats. Drivers out on city streets are advised to use extreme caution as sunset will happen at approximately 530 p.m., which means that most trickortreaters searching for candy and treats around neighbourhoods in the dark. Halloween should be a funfilled day for all British Columbians, but it can also be a frightening time on our roads. The Insurance Cooperation of BC ICBC said every year on October 31, an average of 250 people are injured and one person is killed in 830 crashes in B.C. including 28 injuries in 112 crashes on Halloween in the Southern Interior. With festivities set to take place throughout the province this weekend and on Tuesday, here are some steps you can take to help keep everyone safe this Halloween Tips for drivers Reduce your speed. Managing your speed on Halloween is essential. Small changes in how you drive can have a big impact, and driving at a lower speed will give you more time to stop in case a child runs across the street unexpectedly. Keep in mind, a vehicle travelling even 30 kmhr needs about 18 metres the length of four cars to stop. Keep your eyes on the road and avoid distractions. Even quick glances away from the road increases your risk of crashing. Distracted and inattentive driving is one of the leading causes of crashes with pedestrians and other road users. Always leave your phone alone while driving. With so many families out on Halloween night, its important to stay focused on the road and be aware of your surroundings at all times.

Remember to yield at crosswalks. Drivers failing to yield in crosswalks is a key contributing factor in collisions involving pedestrians, so make sure to look out for pedestrians near crosswalks and intersections. Have patience. Many drivers will be moving slowly while on the lookout for trickortreaters. If a vehicle is slowing down or is stopped in front of you, dont try to pass. The driver might be stopping to let children cross the road or for something else you cant see.

Anticipate seeing children suddenly dart across the road or walking in unexpected places like driveways, alleys and parking lots. Tips to keep kids safe Be reflective and easy to see. Many costumes can be dark and difficult to see at night. Encourage your child to wear a lightercoloured costume. Add reflective tape to their outfit and treat bag, and have them to use a flashlight or headlamp to help them stand out in the dark. Many costumes can be dark and difficult to see at night.

Plan a safe route. The best trickortreat route is familiar, well established, direct and away from busy main roads. Organize a group to trickortreat together. Walking in a group will make you and your children more visible to drivers. The best trickortreat route is familiar, well established, direct and away from busy main roads. Organize a group to trickortreat together. Walking in a group will make you and your children more visible to drivers. Follow the rules of the road. When trickortreating with your child, always walk on sidewalks and cross at crosswalks. If there is no sidewalk, walk as far to the edge of the road as possible, facing traffic.

A lot has changed in Fredericton since Fredericton Palestine Solidarity was established, in the early 2000s. One of the really interesting and heartening things is that since the early 2000s, when Fredericton Palestine Solidarity began, there are many, many more Arab and Islamic people in Fredericton, said Dr. Brown. The Brunswickan also spoke to Dr. Tracy Glynn, another founding member of Fredericton Palestine Solidarity. Fredericton Palestine Solidarity has been revived during this crisis, with new members, including students, joining their efforts.","In recent weeks, the world has been closely following developments in Palestine and Israel. Following Hamas Operation AlAqsa Flood, the Israeli Defense Forces have responded with ongoing military operations and shelling in Gaza. As of the time of writing, the conflict has escalated into ground and air incursions into the Gaza Strip resulting in thousands of victims and displaced Palestinians. According to Gazas Health Ministry, over 6,000 people have been killed since the attacks began. Many of the victims are children, reflecting Gazas youthful demographic composition. These events have also resonated in Fredericton. Government officials have wasted no time in expressing their support for the Israeli government. On October 10, Blaine Higgs said New Brunswick condemns the terrorist attacks against Israel. We mourn the loss of innocent civilian lives and our prayers are with everyone affected by this unthinkable violence. Higgs had no word of support for Palestinian victims. In response, the Fredericton Palestine Solidarity has been actively involved in advocating for the Palestinian cause. The Brunswickan interviewed Dr. Jeffrey Brown who shared his perspective on the matter. A professor of History at the University of New Brunswick and a founding member of this organisation, he has been an active participant in the most recent proPalestine protests. Im horrified and depressed by Israeli aggression. Concerning Canadas role in the unravelling conflict, Dr. Brown had this to say, It has been to facilitate it, and also obscure the actual nature of the Israeli war on Gaza. However, he also noted positive steps taken by activists. There has been an upsurge in political activity by folks who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, there have been rallies Downtown, he said. A lot has changed in Fredericton since Fredericton Palestine Solidarity was established, in the early 2000s. One of the really interesting and heartening things is that since the early 2000s, when Fredericton Palestine Solidarity began, there are many, many more Arab and Islamic people in Fredericton, said Dr. Brown. So the events are really well attended and there are many more people of Palestinian descent in Fredericton, as well. Regarding the Universitys response, Dr. Brown mentioned that he was aware of a message from the University President acknowledging the events in Israel. However, no organised efforts were noted to support Palestinian or Israeli students. I dont know of the University having done anything, said Dr. Brown. Looking forward, Dr. Brown had these thoughts to offer, I doubt if its feasible in the political climate right now, but I absolutely do think that every responsible peaceloving institution should be engaged in the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign. He continued, I dont think there has ever been a campaign here at UNB to try to move the University in that direction. But what that would take would be an organised effort by the students, faculty and staff to persuade the UNB administration to take part in BDS, Dr. Brown concluded. The Brunswickan also spoke to Dr. Tracy Glynn, another founding member of Fredericton Palestine Solidarity. According to her website, Dr. Glynn is an activistscholar based in Fredericton. She teaches at both St. Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick. I think its very difficult to watch whats unfolding and in the Palestinian territories right now, watching that number of people be killed, she said. I work with somebody whose wife lost her uncle and cousin and a two year old child. I think groups like Fredericton Palestine Solidarity, and other groups across the country, are also shocked by the statements that are coming from the government, she said. Theyre maybe not a surprise, because it follows the longstanding support for the State of Israel. But I think that with every attack, with every blockade of food and electricity, and loss of life, its time for our government representatives to have some courage, she continued. Dr. Glynn also acknowledged that speaking up against the actions of the State of Israel can be challenging, citing personal experiences of being targeted, along with professors and others. Fredericton Palestine Solidarity has been revived during this crisis, with new members, including students, joining their efforts. Dr. Glynn sees students as having a significant role in advocating for the Palestinian cause, particularly in educational institutions, where they can raise awareness and facilitate discussions. We can educate people through talks making connections between settler colonialism in Canada and in the Palestinian territories, said Dr. Glynn. For students, it is often a freedom of speech issue, where Palestinian voices are often silenced. I think if we cant stand up for some of the most oppressed people in the world, you know, we have a problem, she opined. Genocide is currently unfolding. Fredericton Palestine Solidarity is currently promoting rallies, vigils, and other demonstrations downtown. They are also organising a Palestinian film festival at the Gallery on Queen, which will feature a film every Wednesday at 730 pm, starting on November 8 and running until the end of the month.",1

Why cant we embrace a system of meritocracy to ensure that those enterprises and institutions are led by professionalism The National Solid Waste Management Authority NSWMA, for example. Over the years, both political parties used this agency as a foodeating programme for the leadership as well as the operatives. I want to begin with logistics this is the need to have a logistic department in the NSWMA to organise a smooth operation of garbage collection while there are motorists with people going to work and school. During the rainy morning on October 25 along Grants Pen Road, between Shortwood and Barbican Roads, I was in the line for more than 15 minutes and did not move 200 metres because a garbage truck was on the road. This was happening while the flood water was rising on the road. I had to turn around, like many other motorists, to hustle for alternative route. This is a general scene not just in Grants Pen, but across the Corporate Area, and at times people are late for work and children late for school due to massive traffic jams cause by garbage collection. I think there is the need to find a way to avoid garbage collection during peak hours, and this is where logistics applies. It is important to have the kind of leadership in the NSWMA that can lead change through a new system of solid waste management. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaners morning and evening newsletters. Second, I hear the head of the NSWMA with repeated calls for people to separate garbage and do composting. This is not how it is done. Separation of garbage must be a legal regime, and it is ludicrous to ask all people to compost to reduce garbage that are to be disposed. People, out of their good hear,t will enter into activities related to composting. The modern solid waste management seeks to develop economic opportunities from the separation of garbage, such as recycling waste to energy and major compost facilities. This is why it may be a wise idea to decentralise garbage collection within the context of a reenergised local government. Local government must clamour for this change, because if central government has no interest in pursuing viable economic activities, then the local government must step forward to urge the return of garbage collection to the local administration. It is not easy to say to these political parties that this persistent practice of nepotism is most destructive to national development and contribute to our continued underdevelopment.

Cette habitante de Nakusp, une ville situe sur le pourtour du rservoir, dans la partie sud de lintrieur de la ColombieBritannique, raconte avoir vu des milliers de poissons morts sur le rivage. La scheresse est en partie responsable de la situation, mais le Trait entre le Canada et les tatsUnis dAmrique relatif au dveloppement coopratif des ressources hydriques du bassin du fleuve Columbia Trait du fleuve Columbia contribue aussi faire baisser le niveau de leau. Il a t conclu la suite dune inondation catastrophique du cours deau en 1948, qui a dtruit la ville de Vanport, prs de Portland, dans lOregon. Le trait a conduit la cration de trois barrages en ColombieBritannique et dun quatrime dans ltat du Montana, dans le bassin hydrographique du fleuve Columbia. Ces barrages servent la fois lutter contre les inondations et produire de lnergie hydrolectrique. Ce trait de 62 ans est en train dtre revu par les Amricains et les Canadiens. La partie du trait qui donne aux tatsUnis le contrle direct dune partie de leau du rservoir des lacs Arrow et de deux autres barrages de ColombieBritannique doit en effet expirer en septembre 2024. Les rcents phnomnes mtorologiques extrmes, comme la grave scheresse qui a svi cette anne en ColombieBritannique, ont mis en lumire les problmes de laccord qui, selon les habitants du bassin du fleuve Columbia, doivent tre rsolus durgence. Le rservoir des lacs Arrow, qui stend sur 230 kilomtres et se compose des lacs Arrow suprieur et infrieur, a t cr lors de la construction du barrage Hugh Keenleyside, en 1968, en vertu du trait. Impact sur lconomie et le tourisme Le 24 octobre, le niveau deau du rservoir est tomb 423,7 mtres audessus du niveau de la mer. Ce niveau navait pas t atteint depuis plus de 20 ans. Victoria Youmans estime que le niveau du lac pourrait encore baisser dici la fin de lhiver et que les faibles niveaux deau entravent le tourisme et les loisirs sur le lac. Dautres problmes commerciaux se posent. Le maire de Nakusp, Tom Zeleznik, note que les faibles niveaux deau ont rendu certaines parties du rservoir impraticables pour les navires transportant des grumes, ce qui entrane la fermeture de certaines entreprises et oblige recourir des transports terrestres plus coteux. Katrine Conroy, la ministre provinciale charge du dossier du Trait du fleuve Columbia et dpute de Kootenay West, affirme que la province est lgalement tenue, en vertu du trait, de diriger leau vers les tatsUnis pour la protection contre les inondations, la production dlectricit, ainsi que pour les poissons . Les ngociations pour la refonte du trait ont commenc en 2018. La dernire runion avait lieu Portland, le 13 octobre dernier. Vers un rgime ad hoc Si un nouvel accord de lutte contre les inondations nest pas conclu dici septembre de lanne prochaine, le trait prvoit actuellement le passage un rgime ad hoc . Les autorits amricaines devraient alors sappuyer sur la capacit de leurs propres barrages pour lutter contre les inondations avant de pouvoir faire appel aux barrages canadiens pour retenir leau en cas de besoin. Les tatsUnis sinquitent des consquences que ce rgime ad hoc pourrait avoir sur le pays. Le corps des ingnieurs de larme amricaine voque notamment des inondations et des perturbations des corridors de transport . En rgle gnrale, la province reoit entre 150 et 200 millions de dollars par an pour financer des programmes tels que le Columbia Basin Trust, qui aide les rgions touches par les barrages. Selon Kathy Eichenberger, responsable de la ngociation du trait pour la ColombieBritannique, les barrages ont galement permis dviter, en 2012, des inondations dans les communauts de Trail et de Castlegar, situes dans la province.

It explained that a broad trough, currently located across the central Caribbean, is producing a large area of cloudiness with showers and thunderstorms, and is expected to linger across the region through to Friday. It added that a prefrontal trough is expected to move into the region by Wednesday and interact with the broad trough resulting in greater instability across the area, especially on Wednesday and Thursday.

Marie looking to get their winter tires may want to schedule an appointment this week to avoid having to wait until December. According to a number of automotive service providers in town, their phones have been ringing nonstop ever since the Sault was hit with several early inches of snow this week. Marcel Lamoureux, the owner of Marcels Automotive on Queen Street, said his shop is booked up with winter tire appointments into late next week. But thats better than most places in town, according to the mechanic. People around town are being told December from some tire shops, he said. I was out of town yesterday, so we were closed, but today were swamped. Everybody wants winter tires today. I had 20 calls before noon. The snowfall appeared to come as a surprise to many as even Sault Police had to issue their annual Winter Driving Preparedness Month news release two days before November. While his team can only afford to do three or four winter tire changes a day, Lamoureux is feeling more concerned about the dwindling number of garages in town. Two more garages closed last week since they cant get workers, so all those customers have to go somewhere else, he said. Even Im looking for another guy but theyre not available out there. Meanwhile, the local exhaust service provider Jiggerz told SooToday theyve been receiving lots of calls about winter tires. But the Wallace Terrace shop doesnt even do them. We probably had ten calls yesterday and we dont do tires, they said. But its funny, people live here their whole life and forget winter starts around the same time most years. Over at Kal Tire, employees are now installing winter tires on 35 vehicles each day. Since the snowfall on Monday, Kal Tire had already replaced winter tires on 44 vehicles as of noon on Tuesday. The shops manager Tyler Plaunt credits his experienced team for their efficiency during an incredibly busy time. This isnt their first goaround, he said. We know what to expect and we manage around it. Its a little harder when you have a fresh team who hasnt been through a winter rush before, but the vast majority of them have been through it at least once, so we just plan accordingly. I wouldnt be surprised if weve already done 500 vehicles in October, he added. As of Tuesday afternoon, the earliest bookings for Kal Tire was two and a half weeks for new tire installs and three weeks for most of their other services.

This challenging project has improved safety and reliability for the more than 35,000 commuters who use the corridor every day. We know the Malahat is a critical connection for residents, businesses, emergency services and the movement of goods on the Island, said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. The completion of this project doesnt just ensure safety for drivers. It increases our resiliency for dealing with future climate events and it means people can keep counting on this route to get to their work, homes and families. On Nov. 15, 2021, approximately 50 metres of the northbound lane of the highway at Tunnel Hill were washed out. A culvert outlet was severely damaged and several sections of the retaining wall were compromised. Temporary repairs were completed to stabilize the slope and reopen the highway to twolane traffic while permanent repairs were underway. Permanent repairs and crucial safety upgrades were made to the site, which is bordered by steep cliffs, restoring approximately 50 metres of the northbound lane and repairing damage to existing drainage and slope stability. The improvements included replacing an 80metrelong retaining wall with a 100metrelong wall and increasing drainage capacity to protect against extreme weather. The project was the first contract awarded for permanent repairs to British Columbia highways in the aftermath of the 2021 rains and floods. The permanent repairs began in July 2022 and were completed this month. Final works included repaving, line painting, barrier placement and other work.

I thought she was originally going to take her grandkids to see Taylor Swift.The seller provided their email address, and Debbie etransferred the 1,200. After realizing she was scammed, Debbie was blocked minutes later and couldnt send any more messages. Because Debbie put in the email address herself and it was an autodeposit, there was nothing the bank could do. Feeling embarrassed by the ordeal, Debbie is hopeful her story will prevent someone else from making a similar mistake.","Everything seemed to be legit Local mother who lost 1,200 in a Facebook ticket fraud is telling her story in the hopes of warning others Not in her wildest dreams did a Sault woman ever think she would fall victim to a ticket scam. Debbie F. who agreed to share her story with SooToday on the condition that her last name not be published is out 1,200 after she attempted to purchase tickets for one of Taylor Swifts soldout concerts in Toronto next year. The local mother was scrolling through social media last Friday when she read a post in one of the Saults community Facebook pages that an older woman was reselling four tickets at face value. I sent them a message and asked if she still had the tickets available, and the person replied that she did, she told SooToday. I was so excited over the fact that the tickets were that cheap. I thought it would have been a wonderful gift for my daughter. Debbie says the seller whose Facebook page says she lives in Ottawa but has family photos from the Sault had sent her a picture of the Ticketmaster link and the seats that were purchased in an effort to verify the sale. I asked her if I could FaceTime with her to make sure she was real, she said. I didnt want to be taken advantage of. But she said she wasnt able to because she was at work. They also told me they ended up selling one of the tickets and only had three left. Sensing something might be off, Debbie went through the sellers Facebook profile. This woman must have originally been from the Sault, she explained. She has photos taken out in Gros Cap, and theres comments from family and friends. Everything seemed to be legit because I was able to see her photos going back years. When Debbie asked why they were offering the Taylor Swift tickets for face value, when most are resold for thousands, the seller mentioned they only wanted to get back what they paid for because their family member was sick and needed help with medical costs. This person was pretty convincing, she said. Her grammar and everything were right up to part. I thought she was originally going to take her grandkids to see Taylor Swift. The seller provided their email address, and Debbie etransferred the 1,200. She asked me if I received the confirmation email yet, and I said no, it hasnt come through. She said, as soon as you send me a picture of the confirmation email, Ill automatically transfer the tickets over to you. Well, the confirmation email of the auto deposit came through, I took a picture and sent it, and had no tickets. She said she was transferring the tickets, but ten minutes later, they came back online and said theres a glitch and that the internet is down. She said the same thing happened earlier with the other person she sold to, and that it took about a half an hour. Fortyfive minutes later, the seller claimed the internet was still down. After realizing she was scammed, Debbie was blocked minutes later and couldnt send any more messages. A short time later, she made contact with the fraud department at her bank. Because Debbie put in the email address herself and it was an autodeposit, there was nothing the bank could do. They were able to tell me the name of the bank it got deposited into, and we have no such bank in North America, she said. They believe the money was deposited to Thailand or Australia because the bank is called Neo Money. After Debbies daughter attempted to reach out to the scammer, they claimed they never received a confirmation email to prove the money was sent, and she was soon blocked as well. I was saving that money over the last year and a half for my daughters graduation, she said. I just wanted to surprise the daylights out of her when she saw the tickets. She would have been over the moon if she opened it up at Christmas time. Shes feeling so bad for me. When SooToday reached out to the scammer on Facebook, the person attempted to sell us the same four tickets they offered to Debbie. If I am selling the ticket to you, it will be personal, do you understand now, they wrote. If you are interested let me know because someone chat me up for the ticket. The scammer claimed they were unavailable for a phone call because they were at work, the same excuse provided to Debbie this past weekend. They seemed so legitimate and the only thing I can think of is the actual person on that account has been hacked, Debbie said. I dont even think the poor woman knows she was hacked. It was a cruel summer for many Swifties as similar scams have been reported dozens of times across the country in recent months many of them much more costly than 1,200. Feeling embarrassed by the ordeal, Debbie is hopeful her story will prevent someone else from making a similar mistake. I just hope this saves someone from falling into the same trap, she said. Im really disappointed for my kids. To learn more about how to identify a scam, click here.",1
