Rescue workers were still searching for nearly 100 missing people, including 22 soldiers, on Thursday, according to the Sikkim state government. Vinay Bhushan Pathak, the states top bureaucrat, said that 26 people had been taken to hospitals with injuries, while nearly 3,000 tourists were stranded in the floodhit areas along with 700 taxi drivers. We are evacuating them through helicopters provided by the army and the air force, he said. The South Llonak Lake has been rising in recent years as a warming climate melts the glaciers that feed it, putting pressure on the dam that contains it, but it wasnt clear what triggered the breach Wednesday. Experts and varying government reports have pointed to sudden, intense rains in the area, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon. Eleven bridges in the Lachan Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said.

Article content Several towns, including Dikchu and Rangpo in the Teesta basin, were flooded, and schools in four districts were ordered shut until Sunday, the states education department said. Parts of a highway that links Sikkim, the state capital, with the rest of the country were also washed away. The floods also hit several army camps, burying vehicles in feet of mud, according to images released by the Indian military. The Press Trust of India news agency cited a statement by neighboring West Bengal state as saying that the bodies of four soldiers were found. However, it wasnt immediately clear whether they were among the 22 missing soldiers, or had died separately. One soldier who had been reported missing on Wednesday was later rescued by authorities, the army said in a statement. The army is providing medical aid and phone connectivity to civilians in the areas of Chungthang, Lachung and Lachen in north Sikkim, the army statement said. Prime Minister Narendra Modis office said in a statement that the government would support state authorities in the aftermath of the flooding.

Article content The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost 1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operations in 2017. Despite risks to dams due to increasing frequency of extreme weather, the Indian federal government aims to increase Indias hydroelectric dam output by half, to 70,000 megawatts, by 2030. Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in Indias Himalayan region during the JuneSeptember monsoon season. Scientists say they are becoming more frequent as global warming contributes to the melting of glaciers there. This is, incredibly sadly, another classic case of a cascading hazard chain that amplifies as you go downstream, said Jakob Steiner, a climate scientist with the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development, commenting on Wednesdays flash flooding. Earlier this year, Steiners organization published a report saying that Himalayan glaciers could lose 80 of their volume if global warming isnt controlled. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. In February 2021, flash floods killed nearly 200 people and washed away houses in Uttarakhand state in northern India. Arasu reported from Bengaluru, India.

Immersive Fort Tokyo will offer 12 attractions spread across 6 shops and restaurants, putting visitors in the middle of fictional situations such as a murder mystery, or a treasure hunt. The venue will be entirely indoors, making use of a shopping mall in the middle of Tokyo Bay that closed its doors last year. The new destination is the brainchild of Tsuyoshi Morioka, a former Procter Gamble Co. executive who made his name by turning around Universal Studios Japan by introducing new attractions, including the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

Fatih Aktas Anadolu Agency Getty Images As New York residents and business owners recover their drenched and damaged properties from Fridays flash floods, city and state officials are confronting the reality that extreme weather is no longer just a passing phenomenon. Theres no question that the rain on Friday is part of a pattern that is directly linked to climate change, New York City Chief Climate Officer Rohit Aggarwala told CNBC in an interview. He grew up in New York when winters were snowy and summers were hot but bearable. He said todays New York reminds him more of Miami than the place he remembers from childhood. In 2020, the National Climate Assessment changed New York Citys climate classification from continental to humid subtropical characterized by mild winters, humid summers and intense rainfall. The city has so far lived up to the new label. Winters have become noticeably warmer. And last weeks storm added to the list of recent record rainfall, bringing back memories of Hurricane Henri in August 2021 and Hurricane Ida in September 2021. What we once thought of as a rare event, a low probability of occurrence maybe these events are increasing in frequency, said Nelson Vaz, a meteorologist at the New York office of the National Weather Service. Aggarwala is leading the charge on the citys climate adaptation strategy. When it comes to rain, Aggarwala is concerned about the lack of permeable surfaces in the city due to people paving over lawns and grass in favor of, for example, new parking spots. What that means is that theres nowhere for the rainwater falling on that property to go, he said. Some ways hes looking to address it Turning basketball court enclosures into giant rain buckets, developing pockets of wetlands, installing socalled rain gardens on sidewalks, and building walls along the shorelines to keep out coastal storms. A 2018 rendering of a cloudburst design basketball court in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, NY. The court is sunken to capture excessive rainfall. Source Marc Wouters Studios The basketball court strategy is an example of cloudburst design, or infrastructure developed specifically for sudden, heavy rainfall like that of last week. Cloudburst basketball courts are depressed into the ground with crowd seating surrounding it, creating an enclosure that could hold excessive storm water. The same idea could be applied to create cloudburst gardens. New Yorks cloudburst infrastructure was piloted in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens. In January, Mayor Eric Adams announced funding for more cloudburst projects in Queens, as well as the Bronx and Brooklyn. Another floodproofing venture is The Bluebelt Program, an initiative that connects storm sewers to ponds, rivers and other wetlands in New York City to create natural detours for excess rain. Its mostly been developed in Staten Island, which Aggarwala says is part of the reason the borough experienced minimal flooding on Friday. A map of a bluebelt in Staten Islands Mill Pond. Bluebelts are connected to storm sewers to collect excess runoff. Source New York City Department of Environmental Protection New York City environmental agencies are also working on installing rain gardens. To the average New Yorker, Aggarwala said, a rain garden might just look like a tree pit with no tree. The gardens receive rain water via a downward slope on the curb of the road, which diverts runoff from overtaxed sewers and puts it to gardening use. Roughly 12,000 rain gardens have already been installed in New York City sidewalks, according to Aggarwala. Rain gardens line a sidewalk in Queens, NY. A downward slope allows rainwater from the road to filter into the gardens. Source NYC Water Along with extreme rainstorms, the climate chief is equally or more concerned about the threat of extreme heat, which causes more fatalities in the city rainfall. His office is working with the city to develop a mandate for air conditioning in residential buildings. In September, New York Governor Kathy Hochul approved the installation of 30,000 window heat pump units, which can be used to heat as well as cool the air in buildings.

The brief ruckus was a test of the Wireless Emergency Alerts system, launched by the Federal Emergency Management Agency more than a decade ago to deliver alerts for extreme weather, missing children and other imminent threats. The National Weather Service and emergency management agencies have used the system effectively since its inception, but with some recent notable failures. The Wireless Emergency Alerts WEA system not only enables the U.S. government to instantly reach hundreds of millions of people nationwide in the case of a widespread emergency such as a terrorist attack, but it also allows local authorities to contact people in a certain area experiencing a more localized threat. The alerts look like text messages and are accompanied by a special tone and vibration. The National Weather Service issues WEAs in dangerous weather situations to get the attention of people who may not be tuned in to local media or subscribed to weather alerting services. Advertisement The alerts have been a game changer in helping to get warnings to people quickly, according to Michael Gerber, a Weather Service meteorologist and emergency alerts expert. Ive heard dozens of stories of lives saved and tragedies avoided as a result of WEAs. The system has experienced its share of successes and failures. More than 70,000 alerts had been sent by emergency managers to warn of severe weather, the Federal Communications Commission said last year, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reports that 136 children have been recovered because of AMBER alerts sent as WEAs. In early August, however, many people did not receive an evacuation alert issued by Maui County in Hawaii during the devastating fires that killed nearly 100 people. Glitches also occurred in the system later in the month, preventing officials in San Bernardino County from sending an evacuation alert as Hurricane Hilary approached California. Advertisement Several tests of the system have gone awry as well. In 2018, also in Hawaii, what was supposed to be an internal test of the system triggered a false warning of a missile threat that caused a wave of panic. In April, many Florida residents were awakened at 445 a.m. by a test alert that was supposed to be on TV but instead sounded alarms on cellphones. The Florida Division of Emergency Management apologized a few hours later. And just last month, the U.S. Tsunami Warning Center mistakenly sent a test tsunami alert to phones in the eastern United States. In recognizing the 10th anniversary of the alerts, the Weather Service highlighted several improvements since their debut. For example, alerts now can be targeted at cellphones within onetenth mile of a warned area, whereas, previously, an entire county was alerted. And the character limit was increased from 90 to 360, allowing the messages to include more information and calls to action. Weather Service works to refine alerting The Weather Service has made occasional changes in its weather alert thresholds with a focus on notifying the public about the most dangerous, lifethreatening hazards. Advertisement In 2020, the agency switched to sending flash flood alerts only where the flooding was tagged as considerable or catastrophic, the two most severe of three categories, thus reducing the number of wireless flash flood alerts by about 85 percent. Previously, it would issue a wireless alert for every flash flood warning, typically totaling about 4,000 per year, a volume that it worried would desensitize people to the hazard. Share this article Share But the agency also has expanded the types of hazards that trigger its alerts. In 2021, the Weather Service began issuing wireless alerts for severe thunderstorm warnings that included the term destructive, a label given to storms expected to produce lifethreatening winds of at least 80 mph or hail at least 2.75 inches in diameter. Previously, wireless alerts were not issued for these warnings, which the Weather Service issues for any thunderstorm that it expects to produce damaging winds of at least 58 mph, hail at least 1 inch in diameter or a tornado. Advertisement In February, the Weather Service completed implementation of emergency alerts for highimpact snow squalls that lead to a sudden onset of whiteout conditions and icy roads. Seeking alerts for severe winter storms Last month, New York Attorney General Letitia James D called for one more change. She wrote a letter to the director of the Weather Service and the administrator of its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, asking for the reinstatement of wireless alerts for severe winter storms. The request came after 47 people died many outdoors or in their vehicles in a historic blizzard in December that buried Buffalo in nearly 50 inches of snow in three days. In the letter, James noted that alerts were sent for major blizzards when the system was deployed in 2012 but that such alerts were discontinued the next year. Such alerts likely would have prompted more people to safely take preparatory measures in the days ahead of the storm, such as stocking up on groceries, medications, and other essential items, or transporting elderlyailing family members or friends to safer spaces, James wrote. And once the Service confirmed the severity of the blizzard and local authorities had announced driving bans, additional WEA alerts could have provided calltoaction messages urging all to remain indoors and stay off the roads to avoid blocking emergency crews and ambulances. James also called for alerts to be issued in more languages than just English and Spanish after 18 people in New York, many of Asian descent, died in flooding caused by Hurricane Ida in 2021. The Weather Service sent a letter of response to James on Tuesday, Weather Service spokeswoman Susan Buchanan said in an email. The letter states that wireless alerts for blizzard and ice storm warnings were terminated on the basis of public feedback, which strongly indicated that too many WEAs were burdensome, overwhelming, and not useful for impending weather events expected in more than 12 hours in the future, according to an excerpt shared with The Washington Post. The letter said the agency is reviewing the ability to issue a special type of warning for particularly dangerous blizzards and ice storms that may enable activation of wireless alerts. Advertisement In considering whether to expand its alerts, the Weather Service will need to grapple with concerns about overwarning the public. Overalerting is a common fear in emergency management circles because it can lead people to ignore alerts and not take needed action. The sheer volume of different updates can be similarly overwhelming, burying emergency alerts in countless other messages, media and communication professors Elizabeth Ellcessor and Hamilton Bean wrote in a commentary about Wednesdays test. Many people have even opted out of alerts when possible, rummaging through settings and toggling off every alert they can find.|1

A concerned parent and activist sent the passage to KHOU 11 News and we went to HISD for answers. Excerpting a passage from a Maya Angelou book, and listen, Im all for kids reading great literature, but the content from this scene doesnt seem appropriate for an 8thgrade ELA English Language Arts class. Thats actually a subject I used to teach. Its a passage that describes pretty graphically an older man coercing a young girl into having sex with him, activist Sim Kern said. It seems to be pretty clear why teachers sounded the alarm over the lesson. Kern has two children who go to HISD schools, but thats not how they found out about it. It was sent to me because I have been talking a lot about the HISD takeover on my TikTok channel. Actually, a lot of teachers have been reaching out to me concerning lesson plans, Kern said. Superintendent Mike Miles acknowledged that the lesson didnt meet HISD standards. He issued this statement Let me begin by assuring parents and families that the curriculum and lessons given to our students will be ageappropriate and meet the high standards that I set when I was appointed in June. The issue with the 8th grade curriculum was discovered, corrected, and all campuses have been directed to ensure the right lessons are shared with children tomorrow. While this issue was identified and corrected before it impacted students or instruction, this does not meet the standards I set for the HISD team, and it does not meet the commitment we made to our educators and students. I have directed the Chief Academic Officer to review all the systems and processes related to curriculum creation to ensure that inappropriate content never gets to classrooms. In addition, I have already begun taking steps to strengthen our curriculum development and review processes. We are paying a team of HISD teacherexperts from each grade level and content area to review curriculum halftime. They will make our lessons better and Im grateful they will be joining the team. Next, we will be reaching out to engage our teachers districtwide and in our divisions to get feedback on the curricular resources we provide. This will help us strengthen lessons, catch errors more quickly so teachers dont have to, and give teachers the support we promised them. The statement didnt ease Kerns concerns. This is not the first passage 8thgrade English Language Arts teachers have seen that theyve had concerns about, Kern said. Kern is not hiding opposition to the Texas Education Agencys takeover of the district but said the teachersexperts are that are reviewing the curriculum should be identified. HISD issued this additional statement As the Superintendent indicated yesterday, no students received the reading passages that were inappropriately included in one of the 8th grade English Language Arts lesson plans for the week. Those lesson plans were replaced with rigorous, ageappropriate content. The Academics team continues to review the development of these lesson plans but at this time we believe the inappropriate passages were due to isolated human error. The curriculum team will continue to meet throughout the week to align on expectations and quality control for lesson plans moving forward. Additionally, the Superintendent continues to engage more teachers as curriculum reviewers We have already hired 25 of the 32 teachers these are HISD teachers who teach halftime and work on curriculum halftime needed to review each grade level and subject area. In October, we are launching opportunities for teachers in each division to partner with district leaders and provide feedback to make our curriculum stronger.|1

Example video title will go here for this video COLUMBIA, S.C. Wednesday, October 4, 2023, marked the 8year anniversary of the historic 2015 flood, when more than 20 inches of rain inundated parts of the Midlands. The flood destroyed many homes and businesses and caused the Columbia Canal to breach. Now, businesses and the City of Columbia are looking back on what happened and whats ahead. We were flabbergasted, President of Forest Lake Fabrics Michael Marsha said. The force of water is remarkable. Marsha remembers the 2015 flood like it was yesterday, as water washed out his business. There was fabric all out in the woods, across the street. It was a wicked scene, Marsha said. Forest Lake Fabrics says they lost 1 million in inventory. When it comes to the larger community, the flooding caused an embankment breach at the Columbia Canal, which threatened the drinking supply for thousands of Columbia residents. In 2015, people lined up for bottles of drinking water offered to those impacted. Eight years later, Assistant City Manager Clint Shealy says the City of Columbia is continuing work on the Columbia Canal through three projects. So, the first project is replacing the head gates. So, up at the entrance of the canal, the head gates during the flood became lodged with debris, so we were unable to close those gates to limit flow coming into the canal. We were unable to do that with the technology we had at that time, Shealy said. That design is complete and, in a few months will be out for bid. Then comes project two embankment recovery project. This project is scoped to repair that breach and also repair any damage along the tow of our embankment upstream, Shealy said. Last will be to have an alternative water supply. Now, the City of Columbia, residents in the surrounding communities, and businesses like Forest Lake Fabrics are moving forward and hoping nothing like the 2015 flood ever happens again. To not only restore our water supply to as good were in October 2015 but to make it better and more resilient than 2015, Shealy said.|1
