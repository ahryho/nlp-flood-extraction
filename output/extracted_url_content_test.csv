Theres no question that the rain on Friday is part of a pattern that is directly linked to climate change, New York City Chief Climate Officer Rohit Aggarwala told CNBC in an interview. He grew up in New York when winters were snowy and summers were hot but bearable. He said todays New York reminds him more of Miami than the place he remembers from childhood. In 2020, the National Climate Assessment changed New York Citys climate classification from continental to humid subtropical characterized by mild winters, humid summers and intense rainfall. The city has so far lived up to the new label. Winters have become noticeably warmer. And last weeks storm added to the list of recent record rainfall, bringing back memories of Hurricane Henri in August 2021 and Hurricane Ida in September 2021. What we once thought of as a rare event, a low probability of occurrence maybe these events are increasing in frequency, said Nelson Vaz, a meteorologist at the New York office of the National Weather Service. Aggarwala is leading the charge on the citys climate adaptation strategy. When it comes to rain, Aggarwala is concerned about the lack of permeable surfaces in the city due to people paving over lawns and grass in favor of, for example, new parking spots. What that means is that theres nowhere for the rainwater falling on that property to go, he said. Some ways hes looking to address it Turning basketball court enclosures into giant rain buckets, developing pockets of wetlands, installing socalled rain gardens on sidewalks, and building walls along the shorelines to keep out coastal storms.|0
