Icy floodwaters kill at least 31 in India's Himalayan northeast after lake bursts through major dam Article content NEW DELHI (AP) Ice-cold floodwaters swept through mountain towns in Indias Himalayan northeast, killing at least 31 people, washing away houses and bridges, and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes, officials said Friday. The flood began shortly after midnight Wednesday, when the waters of a glacial lake overflowed, cracking open Sikkim States biggest hydroelectric dam and then cascading through towns in the valley below. Article content It was the latest deadly flood to hit northeast India in a year of unusually heavy monsoon rains. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in nearby Himachal Pradesh state, record rains in July killed more than 100 people over two weeks in northern India.

Rescue workers were still searching for nearly 100 missing people, including 22 soldiers, on Thursday, according to the Sikkim state government. Vinay Bhushan Pathak, the states top bureaucrat, said that 26 people had been taken to hospitals with injuries, while nearly 3,000 tourists were stranded in the flood-hit areas along with 700 taxi drivers. We are evacuating them through helicopters provided by the army and the air force, he said. The South Llonak Lake has been rising in recent years as a warming climate melts the glaciers that feed it, putting pressure on the dam that contains it, but it wasnt clear what triggered the breach Wednesday. Experts and varying government reports have pointed to sudden, intense rains in the area, and a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck nearby Nepal on Tuesday afternoon. Eleven bridges in the Lachan Valley were washed away by the floodwaters, which also hit pipelines and damaged or destroyed more than 270 houses in four districts, officials said.

Article content Several towns, including Dikchu and Rangpo in the Teesta basin, were flooded, and schools in four districts were ordered shut until Sunday, the states education department said. Parts of a highway that links Sikkim, the state capital, with the rest of the country were also washed away. The floods also hit several army camps, burying vehicles in feet of mud, according to images released by the Indian military. The Press Trust of India news agency cited a statement by neighboring West Bengal state as saying that the bodies of four soldiers were found. However, it wasnt immediately clear whether they were among the 22 missing soldiers, or had died separately. One soldier who had been reported missing on Wednesday was later rescued by authorities, the army said in a statement. The army is providing medical aid and phone connectivity to civilians in the areas of Chungthang, Lachung and Lachen in north Sikkim, the army statement said. Prime Minister Narendra Modis office said in a statement that the government would support state authorities in the aftermath of the flooding.

Article content The Teesta 3 hydropower project, built on the Teesta River, took nine years and cost $1.5 billion to construct. The project was capable of producing 1,200 megawatts of electricity enough to power 1.5 million Indian homes and began operations in 2017. Despite risks to dams due to increasing frequency of extreme weather, the Indian federal government aims to increase Indias hydroelectric dam output by half, to 70,000 megawatts, by 2030. Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in Indias Himalayan region during the June-September monsoon season. Scientists say they are becoming more frequent as global warming contributes to the melting of glaciers there. This is, incredibly sadly, another classic case of a cascading hazard chain that amplifies as you go downstream, said Jakob Steiner, a climate scientist with the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development, commenting on Wednesdays flash flooding. Earlier this year, Steiners organization published a report saying that Himalayan glaciers could lose 80% of their volume if global warming isnt controlled. Last month, dam breaches caused by Storm Daniel caused devastating damage to the city of Derna in Libya. In February 2021, flash floods killed nearly 200 people and washed away houses in Uttarakhand state in northern India. Arasu reported from Bengaluru, India.

Immersive Fort Tokyo will offer 12 attractions spread across 6 shops and restaurants, putting visitors in the middle of fictional situations such as a murder mystery, or a treasure hunt. The venue will be entirely indoors, making use of a shopping mall in the middle of Tokyo Bay that closed its doors last year. The new destination is the brainchild of Tsuyoshi Morioka, a former Procter & Gamble Co. executive who made his name by turning around Universal Studios Japan by introducing new attractions, including the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Hes seeking to tap into a wider global trend toward immersive entertainment, an industry worth an estimated $61.8 billion in 2019. This will be the worlds first permanent immersive entertainment facility, Morioka said on Thursday at a news conference to announce the event. You will be a part of the entertainment. The venue will take up two floors across 30,000 square meters. Pricing and details of specific attractions will be released at a later date. Katana Inc., the company established by Morioka in 2017, has worked to revamp other parks in Japan, such as Huis Ten Bosch near the southern city of Nagasaki and Seibuen Amusement park near Tokyo. Tokyo Disney Resorts two parks and Universal Studios Japan in Osaka were among the top five most visited amusement and theme parks worldwide in 2022, with each place attracting more than 10 million people annually, according to a report by researcher AECOM and the Themed Entertainment Association. Sales at amusement and theme parks in Japan almost doubled to 671 billion ($4.5 billion) during the fiscal year ended March from a year earlier, 93% of pre-pandemic levels seen four years ago, according to government data. Morioka said that he wanted to bring content known within and outside Japan to Immersive Fort Tokyo.

Fatih Aktas Anadolu Agency Getty Images As New York residents and business owners recover their drenched and damaged properties from Friday's flash floods, city and state officials are confronting the reality that extreme weather is no longer just a passing phenomenon. ""There's no question that the rain on Friday is part of a pattern that is directly linked to climate change,"" New York City Chief Climate Officer Rohit Aggarwala told CNBC in an interview. He grew up in New York when winters were snowy and summers were hot but bearable. He said today's New York reminds him more of Miami than the place he remembers from childhood. In 2020, the National Climate Assessment changed New York City's climate classification from continental to humid subtropical characterized by mild winters, humid summers and intense rainfall. The city has so far lived up to the new label. Winters have become noticeably warmer. And last week's storm added to the list of recent record rainfall, bringing back memories of Hurricane Henri in August 2021 and Hurricane Ida in September 2021. ""What we once thought of as a rare event, a low probability of occurrence maybe these events are increasing in frequency,"" said Nelson Vaz, a meteorologist at the New York office of the National Weather Service. Aggarwala is leading the charge on the city's climate adaptation strategy. When it comes to rain, Aggarwala is concerned about the lack of ""permeable surfaces"" in the city due to people paving over lawns and grass in favor of, for example, new parking spots. ""What that means is that there's nowhere for the rainwater falling on that property to go,"" he said. Some ways he's looking to address it: Turning basketball court enclosures into giant rain buckets, developing pockets of wetlands, installing so-called rain gardens on sidewalks, and building walls along the shorelines to keep out coastal storms. A 2018 rendering of a ""cloudburst design"" basketball court in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, NY. The court is sunken to capture excessive rainfall. Source: Marc Wouters Studios The basketball court strategy is an example of ""cloudburst design,"" or infrastructure developed specifically for sudden, heavy rainfall like that of last week. Cloudburst basketball courts are depressed into the ground with crowd seating surrounding it, creating an enclosure that could hold excessive storm water. The same idea could be applied to create cloudburst gardens. New York's cloudburst infrastructure was piloted in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens. In January, Mayor Eric Adams announced funding for more cloudburst projects in Queens, as well as the Bronx and Brooklyn. Another flood-proofing venture is The Bluebelt Program, an initiative that connects storm sewers to ponds, rivers and other wetlands in New York City to create natural detours for excess rain. It's mostly been developed in Staten Island, which Aggarwala says is part of the reason the borough experienced minimal flooding on Friday. A map of a ""bluebelt"" in Staten Island's Mill Pond. Bluebelts are connected to storm sewers to collect excess runoff. Source: New York City Department of Environmental Protection New York City environmental agencies are also working on installing rain gardens. To the average New Yorker, Aggarwala said, a rain garden might just look like ""a tree pit with no tree."" The gardens receive rain water via a downward slope on the curb of the road, which diverts runoff from overtaxed sewers and puts it to gardening use. Roughly 12,000 rain gardens have already been installed in New York City sidewalks, according to Aggarwala. Rain gardens line a sidewalk in Queens, NY. A downward slope allows rainwater from the road to filter into the gardens. Source: NYC Water Along with extreme rainstorms, the climate chief is equally or more concerned about the threat of extreme heat, which causes more fatalities in the city rainfall. His office is working with the city to develop a mandate for air conditioning in residential buildings. In September, New York Governor Kathy Hochul approved the installation of 30,000 window heat pump units, which can be used to heat as well as cool the air in buildings.

Des recherches sont en cours . Les services durgence sefforcent de venir en aide aux sinistrés, a dit le chef du gouvernement du Sikkim, Prem Singh Tamang, exhortant la population à rester vigilante . Le premier ministre indien Narendra Modi a pour sa part affirmé quil assurait tout le soutien possible aux personnes affectées. La zone touchée, une région montagneuse et isolée de lHimalaya, se trouve près de la frontière avec le Népal et la Chine. Le lac Lhonak est situé au pied dun glacier proche du Kangchenjunga, le troisième plus haut sommet du monde. En raison dun barrage en amont qui avait récemment libéré de leau, le niveau de la Tista était de 4,5 mètres plus élevé que la normale, a souligné larmée indienne. Ponts détruits Six ponts ont été détruits et la route nationale qui relie le Sikkim au reste de lInde a été sérieusement endommagée, a raconté le responsable de la gestion des catastrophes de cet tat, Prabhakar Rai. Une vidéo diffusée par un porte-parole de larmée montre un torrent de couleur brune se déverser dans une vallée plantée de forêts, passant sur des routes et emportant des lignes électriques sur son passage. Sur dautres images partagées par les militaires, on voit des immeubles submergés jusquau premier étage dans une ville avec la pointe dune petite grue de chantier qui émerge de leau. Des précipitations intenses ont conduit à cette situation catastrophique au Sikkim, où la pluie a déclenché une inondation par débordement dun lac glaciaire, endommagé un barrage et causé des pertes en vies humaines , a expliqué Miriam Jackson, une scientifique spécialisée dans la surveillance des glaces dans les régions de lHimalaya. Nous observons que la fréquence de ces évènements extrêmes augmente à mesure que le climat continue de se réchauffer et nous entraîne en territoire inconnu , a ajouté Mme Jackson, dans un communiqué du Centre international pour le développement intégré des montagnes (ICIMOD). Une partie du territoire du Sikkim est revendiquée par Pékin. Une confrontation mineure , selon New Delhi, avait eu lieu en janvier 2021 entre soldats indiens et chinois sur le col de Naku La qui relie le Sikkim à la région du Tibet. Des dizaines de milliers de soldats indiens et chinois sont positionnés de part et dautre de la longue frontière litigieuse entre lInde et la Chine. Le dernier conflit ouvert dampleur entre les deux pays les plus peuplés du monde remonte à la guerre-éclair de 1962, qui avait vu les troupes indiennes être rapidement battues par larmée chinoise. Rester vigilants Dans ltat voisin du Bengale occidental, des personnes ont été évacuées des districts de Kalimpong, Darjeeling et Jalpaiguri vers des endroits plus sûrs. Les inondations et les glissements de terrain sont relativement fréquents en Inde et y causent de nombreux dégâts, notamment pendant la mousson, de juin à septembre. Mais, en octobre, la mousson est dhabitude quasiment terminée. Selon les experts, le changement climatique a augmenté lintensité des tempêtes tropicales, avec notamment des pluies plus abondantes, provoquant de soudaines inondations. La fonte des glaciers himalayens accroît également le volume des cours deau tandis que les constructions non réglementées dans les zones sujettes aux inondations peuvent exposer les populations locales à des catastrophes. Entre 2011 et 2020, les glaciers de lHimalaya ont fondu 65 % plus vite que dans la décennie précédente, selon un rapport publié en juin par lICIMOD. Si lon se fonde sur les trajectoires démissions actuelles, les glaciers pourraient perdre jusquà 80 % de leur volume actuel dici à la fin du siècle, a estimé cette organisation intergouvernementale dont le siège est au Népal.|1

Les annonces à coups de millions deuros se succèdent de part et dautre alors que des corps continuent chaque jour dêtre retirés des décombres ou repêchés dans la mer Méditerranée à Derna, ville côtière dévastée par les flots le 10 septembre. Le gouvernement de lest du pays avait annoncé quune conférence internationale pour la reconstruction de Derna se tiendrait le 10 octobre, avant dêtre contraint de la reporter à début novembre face au scepticisme de la communauté internationale, ce gouvernement nétant pas reconnu par lONU. Il a indiqué avoir déjà évalué les dégâts et les montants des indemnités à verser aux sinistrés. Le Parlement dont il est issu et qui est basé aussi dans lest a affirmé avoir alloué 1,9 milliard deuros à la reconstruction, sans préciser comment cet argent allait être dépensé. Pour illustrer le chaos institutionnel libyen, cest lexécutif rival basé dans lOuest qui a annoncé dimanche une enveloppe denviron 18 millions deuros pour lentretien décoles endommagées par les inondations dans lest. Arbitraires Des estimations de coûts arbitraires et des initiatives de reconstruction unilatérales annoncées sans transparence , a critiqué lundi le chef de la mission de lONU en Libye, Abdoulaye Bathily. Relayant les inquiétudes du peuple libyen , M. Bathily a notamment réclamé une évaluation crédible, indépendante et objective des dégâts et des besoins et des mécanismes transparents dans lattribution des contrats et des marchés publics. Les inondations provoquées par la tempête Daniel et amplifiées par la rupture de deux barrages en amont de Derna ont fait des milliers de morts et de disparus et plus de 40 000 déplacés. Le pays est gouverné par deux exécutifs rivaux : lun à Tripoli (ouest), dirigé par Abdelhamid Dbeibah et reconnu par lONU, lautre dans lest, incarné par le Parlement et affilié au camp du maréchal Khalifa Haftar. M. Bathily a également appelé les autorités libyennes et la communauté internationale à mettre en place un mécanisme national libyen unifié pour la reconstruction et pour garantir la transparence et le contrôle . Les chefs des missions diplomatiques dAllemagne, des tats-Unis, de France, du Royaume-Uni et dItalie ont soutenu fermement lappel de M. Bathily en faveur dun mécanisme national libyen unifié, coordonné avec des partenaires locaux, nationaux et internationaux, capable de fournir une aide transparente , ont-ils indiqué dans un communiqué conjoint. Les tats-Unis avaient déjà appelé la semaine dernière les autorités libyennes à se mettre daccord sur les dépenses prioritaires et à veiller à ce que les fonds soient alloués de manière efficace et appropriée . Opportuniste Les craintes de détournement de laide, relayées par plusieurs personnalités libyennes, ont conduit le chef de mission de lagence daide américaine (USAID) en Libye, John Cardenas, à rencontrer fin septembre le président du bureau daudit libyen, léquivalent dune Cour des comptes, pour senquérir des procédures de suivi de laide et des contributions internationales et de la façon de garantir quelles ne soient pas utilisées à dautres fins , selon le bureau daudit. Claudia Gazzini, spécialiste de la Libye pour lInternational Crisis Group, craint que les gouvernements rivaux de la Libye nutilisent cette crise de manière opportuniste , faisant état dune lutte dinfluence et de campagnes de désinformation pour la prise en charge des efforts de reconstruction . En même temps, les administrations rivales se trouvent contraintes de coopérer en coulisses et de maintenir le statu quo pour pouvoir partager les richesses de ce pays pétrolier, selon des analystes. En 2018 déjà, lancien émissaire de lONU en Libye, Ghassan Salamé, dénonçait le système de prédation économique en Libye , le considérant comme le principal obstacle au processus politique . Aujourdhui encore, des observateurs saccordent sur le même constat.|1

Port aux Basques resident Rosalyn Roy saw flooding at the Big Bridge Hill outside her home. (Submitted by Rosalyn Roy)A rainstorm brought flooding and other complications to Channel-Port aux Basques on Saturday, as the town continues to grapple with the devastating effects of post-tropical storm Fiona. Port aux Basques saw the highest amount of rain Saturday, said Environment Canada meteorologist Tiffany Cheeks, with about 84 millimetres of rain. Channel-Port aux Basques Mayor Brian Button says the town had to bring in additional staff to help respond to calls.|"Port aux Basques experienced minor flooding Saturday as the remnants of post-tropical storm Nicole brought heavy rain. Port aux Basques resident Rosalyn Roy saw flooding at the Big Bridge Hill outside her home. (Submitted by Rosalyn Roy) A rainstorm brought flooding and other complications to Channel-Port aux Basques on Saturday, as the town continues to grapple with the devastating effects of post-tropical storm Fiona. ""Any time we're having weather such as what we had yesterday, it becomes very stressful for both our crews and for staff, and for the residents, because there's still a lot of unknowns,"" said the town's Mayor Brian Button. ""Fiona is trying to keep a long legacy here, and it hasn't let up."" The remnants of post-tropical storm Nicole hit much of Newfoundland on Saturday with a mixed bag of weather, with many areas across the island experiencing snow, heavy rain and ice pellets. Port aux Basques saw the highest amount of rain Saturday, said Environment Canada meteorologist Tiffany Cheeks, with about 84 millimetres of rain. Channel-Port aux Basques Mayor Brian Button says the town had to bring in additional staff to help respond to calls. (Submitted by Rosalyn Roy) The residents of Port aux Basques are no strangers to rain, but due to significant infrastructural damage caused by Fiona, Button said Saturday's rainstorm brought a series of new challenges. Button said town crews were responding to calls all day, attending to issues such as flooding basements and sewer backups. ""We were having so many calls that we had to bring in additional staff,"" said Button. ""We had to bring in some extra crews because there was just too many calls for the crews that we did have out to answer and respond to."" Some residents whose homes weren't affected by Fiona experienced damage for the first time on Saturday, said Button, while other residents discovered damage they weren't previously aware of, such as a plugged up storm drain. ""I know for myself yesterday, you've had people saying, 'You need to take a break,'"" said Button. ""But when that weekend comes and this type of weather comes, it becomes a very stressful event."" Minor flooding When Port aux Basques resident Rosalyn Roy arrived home Saturday afternoon, she says she noticed flooding at Big Bridge Hill, which is just a street away from her house. Roy, who works with the independent newspaper Wreckhouse Weekly, said she got out of her car and stood in the pouring rain to take a picture of the flood. She said crews from the town quickly arrived to drain the area. ""You could see the water levels going down,"" said Roy. ""They did an awesome job of just responding quickly so it wouldn't damage homes or anything like that."" Roy said many residents are used to heavy rainfall so Saturday's rainstorm didn't cause immediate concern. At this point, she said, residents look at the situation as just another thing they have to overcome. Button says crews were responding to calls all day, attending to issues such as flooding basements and sewer backups. (Submitted by Rosalyn Roy) ""Normally this would be no big thing,"" said Roy, ""but because Fiona has damaged a lot of the shoreline infrastructure this turned into a minor flooding situation. Normally, it wouldn't be the case."" The rainstorm tapered off heading into Sunday, so Button says the town will continue cleanup efforts and attempt to fix damage caused by Fiona, some of which he hopes to solve before the town heads into winter. ""People are on edge every time we have a weather forecast that comes in, so we're trying to work through that as well,"" said Button. ""Fiona left us in quite the mess.""

St. Johns resident Steve Shortall was up at 6 oclock Monday morning, Sept. 12, when something caught his eye outside his window. I looked out, and all I could see was water, he said. Shortall has lived on Waterford Bridge Road for 40 years. He said the amount of water overflowing from the Waterford River into his backyard on Monday morning was the most hes ever seen. It just looks like a pond, he said. Post-tropical storm Earl dumped 193.6 millimetres of rain on the west end of St. Johns between Saturday and Monday afternoon, flooding properties and washing out roads. Waterford Bridge Road was flooded east of Bowring Park, and it was impassable Monday morning. One commuter was trapped in his car until firefighters from the St. Johns Regional Fire Department rescued him. The Waterford River is now the Waterford Bridge Rd., River. The road is closed in the area of Corpus Christi church. Stay away from the area and watch for localized flooding. pic.twitter.com/Y6YJ5h6Hdg Keith Gosse (TelyPhotoGosse) September 12, 2022 The river was overflowing in Mount Pearl as well, so much so that firefighters were called to rescue two men from a flooded home on Forest Avenue. The walking trail next to the river from Forest Avenue to Winston Avenue was covered in water for almost a kilometre. In the east end of St. Johns, Rennies River spilled over its banks onto nearby roads, and flooded at least two properties near Portugal Cove Road. The city closed the nearby trail between Kings Bridge Road and Long Pond until Wednesday, Sept. 14. Flooding from overnight rain dropped by post-tropical storm Earl filled up a section of Portugal Cove Road Monday and covered parts of at least two properties in the area. Keith Gosse The Telegram Everything just erupted In the west end, Mooney Crescent, off Old Petty Harbour Road, was like a river, said longtime resident Bill Conway, who has lived on the street for 27 years. Conway said hes never seen a storm cause that much damage in the area. It was just torrential, torrential water coming off the hill. And then, naturally, all the gravel from underneath the pavement and all that came down, and everything just erupted, and everything just tore up. There was about 15 houses flooded, some seniors and some people who just bought houses here. It was just pure madness, he said. This is Mooney Crescent and Old Petty Harbour Road in St. Johns. Road is impassable in this area. pic.twitter.com/I8ttPyFyQ0 Keith Gosse (TelyPhotoGosse) September 12, 2022 Conway said its a close-knit neighbourhood, and everyone helps one another. He said he was out since 6 a.m. with a shovel helping to divert water from peoples homes. He said one resident had about two inches of mud in his house, with about six to eight inches of water on top of the mud. None of us expected this at all because we have storm drains down there, and theyre pretty good, they take out the water, but this rain from 4 oclock to 6 oclock was just utter madness. It was just a downpour, and the storm drains couldnt hold it, and then it tore up the roads up on the main roads, and tore them all up and beat them up, and I mean, theres no way that the road could handle all the rain that was coming through. Floodwater flows along a section of washed-out Mooney Crescent in St. Johns Monday. Keith Gosse The Telegram Its unclear how much the damage will cost the city in repairs, but Lynnann Winsor, the deputy city manager for public works, said thats something theyll look at over the next few days. At press deadline, six city roads remained closed: Symes Bridge, Powers Road, Mooney Crescent, Donovans Road, George Pond Road at Redmonds Road, and Old Petty Harbour Road between Densmores Lane and Cemetery Lane. Winsor said people should consider any trails near rivers to be impassable. City sports fields and Bowring Park also remained closed as of press deadline. A stalled car sits in the middle of a flooded section of Waterford Bridge Road in St. Johns Monday morning, Sept. 12. The driver was rescued by firefighters after his car started to fill with water. Keith Gosse The Telegram Significant flooding Flooding near St. Johns harbour also caused issues. Oceanex executive chairman Capt. Sid Hynes said in a statement that water levels in the area delayed terminal operations until 10 a.m., when the water levels dropped and it was deemed safe to begin operations again. While there was significant flooding observed in the surrounding area, the Oceanex terminal did not sustain any damage. An assessment of the auto compound is ongoing, with only a small number of autos stored in the area affected by flooding, he said.

In a statement, the Canadian Coast Guard said no injuries were reported, and the vessel was stable. We would like to acknowledge the crew members of the CCGS Captain Molly Kool, who took quick action to close and seal the areas of the vessel that were open for repair, to minimize the amount of water ingress, the Coast Guard said in a statement. We are working with Newdock to ensure scheduled repairs can resume quickly when site conditions improve. Workers at the Newdock shipyard in St. Johns walk through floodwater from overnight rain dropped by post-tropical Earl Monday. Keith Gosse The Telegram Dogs relocated In the Goulds neighbourhood of St. Johns, flooding in the basement of the Beagle Paws Rescue on Cochrane Pond Road forced the beagle-rescue organization to relocate its dogs. Lots of people got it a hell of a lot worse, its just difficult when youve got dogs, said manager Sandra Woito. Luckily, Woito had found foster families for six of the dogs last week, so there were only three dogs in the basement at the time of the flooding. She said their kennels are in the basement, but the dogs sleep on beds that are off the floor, so they had a way to stay out of the water. Woito said she posted online about needing someone to care for the three dogs while the shelter was cleaned up from the flooding, and many people offered to help right away. It was wonderful, Woito said. However, the flooding couldnt have happened at a more difficult time for the shelter. Woito said they had a huge influx of dogs this summer like weve never seen it before, she said, and their veterinary bills are now through the roof. The organization accepts donations year-round on its website at www.beaglepaws.com. Water erupts from a storm drain after flooding from overnight rain Monday. Keith Gosse The Telegram Climate change These sorts of weather events are expected to become more common with climate change. According to the Resilient St. Johns Community Climate Plan, which was finalized earlier this year, annual precipitation is expected to increase, and heavy precipitation events are expected to become more extreme. Climate change projections indicate that our climate is expected to become more wetter, warmer, and more extreme, the document said.|1

This article was published 03/05/2022 (575 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current. CODY SELLAR STAFF REPORTER R.M. OF HEADINGLEY Waters pool in Sally Manns backyard and beyond. Its been nothing but headaches since the first rain storm for Headingley resident Sally Mann. Its been horrible. I didnt really think we were going to get that affected by the storm because our houses are built slightly higher, she said. But after a rainstorm piled on to a snowstorm which itself piled on to a winters worth of heavy snowfall, Manns home couldnt keep the water out. It got so the sump pump couldnt handle the amount of water coming in, and then it flooded within seconds, the resident of Dodds Road said. Mann said her basement ended up under five inches of water and mud, while outside waters submerged the street and her backyard completely. Its just nasty down there, she said. Compounding matters, Mann said her insurance company was so busy with calls from other homeowners facing the same issue that it couldnt even estimate a time an agent could make it to her house to assess the damage. Mann, who replaced her flooring not too long before the storm, said shes overwhelmed with it all. Im back to square one now. I really dont want to do it again. I just want to shut the door and walk away. But youve got to theres no other option. If we dont get it cleared out, were going to get damp and mold, Mann said. Headingley mayor John Mauseth said Dodds Road, on which he himself lives, saw the worst of the flooding, in terms of affected homes. He didnt have the exact number but said a handful of houses were flooded. Mauseth said the rural municipality was working almost 24-7 to ensure flows were open and water was flowing through as quickly as possible. Backhoes were clearing some of the larger drains and problem areas were noted for potential repairs during summer. Dodds Road in Headingley sits underwater. I cant say that Ive ever seen it quite this bad, he said. Mauseth commended local residents and public works employees who rushed out to help flooded areas with sandbagging and running pumps. Overland flooding was common in other municipalities just west of the city, as well. In the rural municipality of Rosser, public works crews worked to clear ditches and culverts and in a couple of cases, even cut a couple of roads to divert water flows. Rosser reeve Frances Smee said that entails careful examination to ensure waters are not directed toward other people or communities. Were all hands on deck dealing with this, Smee said. Brad Erb, reeve of the R.M. of MacDonald, said crews there were also clearing ditches and culverts, as well as providing sandbags to residents where localized overland flooding had occurred. Erb said he and his government were keeping an eye on provincial flood forecasts, as more rains filled the forecasts for the weekend leading into May, which came after the publication time for this paper. Christa Vann Mitchell, reeve of the R.M. of Cartier, said several areas had experienced overland flooding, with the most occurring at the Elm Creek Channel. Residences at the James Valley Hutterite Colony were affected, Vann Mitchell said, but she was not aware of any other property damage in the area. The R.M. went so far as to declare a state of local emergency due to the flooding on Apr. 24. On Apr. 27, it released a list of roads to avoid because they were under water.

In the rural municipality of Ritchot, just south of Winnipeg, 88 households have been asked to evacuate their homes, which lie outside a ring dike. So far, only 10 households have evacuated, said Mayor Chris Ewen. Their homes are located on low-lying roads, and if the water gets too high, it may be difficult for them to leave or for emergency services to reach them, he said. ""We want to make sure that when you do get that evacuation order, you've really taken into consideration your quality of life and your family members, and what that means to stay at home,"" Ewen said in an interview on Saturday. Joel Lemoine worked with a number of other community members to help monitor flooding just north of Ste. Agathe. (Radio-Canada) But families don't know how long they could be away from their homes if they do leave, nor does the RM's mayor. ""I wish I could predict the weather and see what happens over the next few days, but it could be anywhere from a 12-hour concern all the way to a couple of weeks, depending on what the severity of the situation is,"" Ewen said. Just outside of Ste. Agathe, located in the RM of Ritchot, crews slept in their vehicles overnight, with each member taking turns watching the pumps and other equipment to ensure everything ran smoothly. ""For the next probably week or two, we're still going to be monitoring to make sure the Red River doesn't go over capacity"" and to keep an eye on the community's dike, said Joel Lemoine, who lives in the town. A tiger dam wraps around the outside of a home on Fisher River Cree Nation. The community has several other houses that are similarly protected as floodwaters rise. One household has been evacuated. (Submitted by Jeremy Neault) To the southwest of Ritchot, the city of Morden declared a local state of emergency on Saturday, as rising water levels there forced dozens of people from their homes. Further north, Fisher River Cree Nation, on the western banks of Lake Winnipeg, was also under a state of emergency. It was declared on Friday, over fears this weekend's rainfall would lead to significant risk of flooding, the First Nation said in a social media post. Crews stand guard at a dike just north of Ste. Agathe on Saturday. (Radjaa Abdelsadok/Radio-Canada) Chief David Crate says seven homes are directly affected by flooding, and one household was evacuated because road access was quickly deteriorating. ""The water came up on the river about a foot since last night, and the other problem we're having, of course, is the rain now,"" he said. ""We're getting overland flooding now."" Crate says Indigenous Services Canada and the neighbouring community of Peguis First Nation provided Fisher River with inflatable Tiger Dams, which will hopefully help the flood-prone community. Winnipeggers sandbag In Winnipeg, people continue sandbagging to protect homes threatened by the rising water. Andrew Valgardson spent part of Saturday collecting sandbags provided by the City of Winnipeg at the Waverley Street garage to help protect his mother-in-law's Charleswood home. Her basement flooded from water pooling in the backyard, so he made two trips to fill his truck up with sandbags. Valgardson, who is a trucker, said the weather has also been bad for business. ""With the snow and the rain and everything, roads are closed, highways are closed. Warehouses are closed. Staff can't make it to work. It's been really bad,"" he said. Andrew Valgardson picked up sandbags on Saturday to help protect his mother-in-law's house in Charleswood. (CBC) Bob Hunt also picked up some sandbags on Saturday. He said he hasn't had any flooding so far, but isn't taking any chances. ""I err on the side of caution. If you don't have the bags, it'll flood out,"" he said. As rain continued to fall Saturday, he said he had ""never experienced weather like this."" ""It's this winter from hell and it won't let go,"" he said. ""Maybe I should invest in a boat."" The rain is expected to continue throughout the weekend, eventually tapering off Sunday as the system moves from west to east. For those who need sandbags, the City of Winnipeg says they are available for free, 24 hours a day, at three locations in the city: 1220 Pacific Ave., 1090 Thomas Ave. and 1539 Waverley St."|1

The R.M. of Dufferin announced on Sunday the State of Emergency was put into effect because water from the Boyne River is spilling over its banks. Its very rampant at the moment. Ive lived in this area for a long time and been along the river and never seen it this high, George Gray, the Reeve of the R.M. of Dufferin, told CTV News. Its like a wild horse coming down the river. Gray said at least half a dozen homes have been given evacuation orders just west of the Town of Carman, and more evacuations are possible. He said the western part of the municipality is the hardest hit right now, as roads have been washed out and there is a lot of overland flooding. Gray isnt expecting any more rain to hit the area but he knows that they arent out of the woods yet. There is just so much water coming from the westand it is just coming so fast, we just cant keep ahead of it. He added that the river hasnt crested yet either, noting the situation will probably get worse before it gets better. The community hall has been opened for people who have been evacuated and Gray said for those who use the hall, they must register first so the R.M. knows how many people it has. The Town of Winnipeg Beach also announced a local State of Emergency to deal with the flooding situation in the area. A statement from the towns mayor said the decision was made so council can bring in the equipment and contractors needed to assist with infrastructure that may be in jeopardy. Mayor Tony Pimentel called the move a proactive measure. At this time our public works and utility staff are working closely with our emergency measures officer in order to ensure we are protected, Pimentel said in a statement. Pimentel is reminding residents to stay away from areas where water is flowing. He said there are no concerns for evacuations and if things change, an update will be provided. Joining the R.M. of Dufferin and Winnipeg Beach is the Town of Arborg, the R.M. of Gimli and the Long Plain First Nation. All places announced local States of Emergency Sunday due to ongoing flooding issues. Arborg said in a Facebook post that the emergency would be in effect until May 21, noting the town is dealing with flooding that needs prompt action. Potential evacuees are in the process of being notified and arrangements are being made for accommodations, the post said. Residents are being reminded to not travel through water that is over roads. Long Plain First Nation said Elders, people with medical needs and those who have impassible lanes are being evacuated and this will continue to happen until the emergency is over. The R.M. of Gimli said in a Facebook post the measures being taken are proactive to protect infrastructure and properties. No evacuations have been required at this time. On Saturday, the City of Morden also delcared a local State of Emergency as it was battered by rain and excessive flooding.|1
